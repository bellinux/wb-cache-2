2500|$|A {{conductor}} cable was laid {{in a trench}} between the rails. At [...] intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about [...] above the road) and a bell crank. A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the {{conductor cable}} and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was magnetised by <b>electro-magnets</b> and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the <b>electro-magnets.</b> A small battery was carried to charge the <b>electro-magnets</b> should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails.|$|E

The {{similarity}} of action, almost amounting to identity, between common magnets and either <b>electro-magnets</b> or volta-electric currents, is strikingly {{in accordance with}} and confirmatory of M. Ampère's theory, and furnishes powerful reasons for believing that the action is the same in both cases; but, as a distinction in language is still necessary, I propose to call the agency thus exerted by ordinary magnets, magneto-electric or magnelectric induction (26).|$|E

50|$|Direct {{electric}} {{action is}} one of various systems used in pipe organs to control the flow of air (wind) into the organ's pipes when the corresponding keys or pedals are depressed. In direct electric action, the valves beneath the pipes are opened directly by <b>electro-magnet</b> solenoids, while with electro-pneumatic action, the <b>electro-magnet's</b> action admits air into a pneumatic or small bellows which in turn operates the pipe's valve.|$|R
6000|$|... 1062. The {{power of}} {{producing}} these phenomena exists therefore {{in the simple}} helix, as in the <b>electro-magnet,</b> although by no means in the same high degree.|$|R
6000|$|... 1052. The {{electromotor}} used {{consisted of}} a cylinder of zinc introduced between the two parts of a double cylinder of copper, and preserved from metallic contact in the usual way by corks. The zinc cylinder was eight inches high and four inches in diameter. Both it and the copper cylinder were supplied with stiff wires, surmounted by cups containing mercury; {{and it was at}} these cups that the contacts of wires, helices, or <b>electro-magnets,</b> used to complete the circuit, were made or broken. These cups I will call G and E throughout the rest of this paper (1079.).|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Certain {{effects of}} the {{induction}} of electrical currents have already been recognised and described: as those of magnetization; Ampère's experiments of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral; his repetition with <b>electro-magnets</b> of Arago's extraordinary experiments, and perhaps a few others. Still it appeared unlikely that these could be all the effects which induction by currents could produce; especially as, upon dispensing with iron, almost the whole of them disappear, whilst yet an infinity of bodies, exhibiting definite phenomena of induction with electricity of tension, still remain to be acted upon by the induction of electricity in motion.|$|E
6000|$|... 129. The {{effect of}} {{rotation}} or deflection of the needle, which M. Arago obtained by ordinary magnets, M. Ampère succeeded in procuring by <b>electro-magnets.</b> This is perfectly {{in harmony with}} the results relative to volta-electric and magneto-electric induction described in this paper. And by using flat spirals of copper wire, through which electric currents were sent, in place of ordinary magnetic poles (Ill.), sometimes applying a single one {{to one side of the}} rotating plate, and sometimes two to opposite sides, I obtained the induced currents of electricity from the plate itself, and could lead them away to, and ascertain their existence by, the galvanometer.|$|E

A more rapid revolution will be obtained if a small <b>electro-magnet</b> be substituted for a steel magnet, as {{is shown in the}} cut. The <b>electro-magnet</b> is fixed to the stand, and included in the circuit with the spur-wheel, so that the current flows through them in succession. Hence the direction of the rotation will not be changed by reversing that of the current; since the polarity of the electromagnet will also be reversed." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{production}} of the shock from the current in the cross wire, whether D was a long extended wire, or a helix, or an <b>electro-magnet,</b> has been already described (1060. 1061. 1064.).|$|R
50|$|The first models typed {{on a paper}} {{attached}} to a cylinder, which {{could be made to}} move both rotationally with the cylinder and longitudinally along the cylinder, enabling the user to format and space the letters manually. The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an <b>electro-magnet</b> for the Ball which controlled both the typewriter's movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen's machine the first electric typewriter. This <b>electro-magnet</b> was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical escapement in the typewriter's clockwork, moving the carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed.|$|R
6000|$|... 1093. Viewing the {{phenomena}} as {{the results of}} the induction of electrical currents, many of the principles of action, in the former experiments, become far more evident and precise. Thus the different effects of short wires, long wires, helices, and <b>electro-magnets</b> (1069.) may be comprehended. If the inductive action of a wire a foot long upon a collateral wire also a foot in length, be observed, it will be found very small; but if the same current be sent through a wire fifty feet long, it will induce in a neighbouring wire of fifty feet a far more powerful current at the moment of making or breaking contact, each successive foot of wire adding to the sum of action; and by parity of reasoning, a similar effect should take place when the conducting wire is also that in which the induced current is formed (74.): hence the reason why a long wire gives a brighter spark on breaking contact than a short one (1068.), although it carries much less electricity.|$|E
6000|$|... 57. The various {{experiments}} of {{this section}} prove, I think, most completely the production of electricity from ordinary magnetism. That its intensity should be very feeble and quantity small, cannot be considered wonderful, when it is remembered that like thermo-electricity it is evolved entirely within the substance of metals retaining all their conducting power. But an agent which is conducted along metallic wires in the manner described; which whilst so passing possesses the peculiar magnetic actions and force of a current of electricity; which can agitate and convulse the limbs of a frog; and which, finally, can produce a spark[A] by its discharge through charcoal (32.), can only be electricity. As all the effects can be produced by ferruginous <b>electro-magnets</b> (34.), {{there is no doubt}} that arrangements like the magnets of Professors Moll, Henry, Ten Eyke, and others, in which as many as two thousand pounds have been lifted, may be used for these experiments; in which case not only a brighter spark may be obtained, but wires also ignited, and, as the current can pass liquids (23.), chemical action be produced. These effects are still more likely to be obtained when the magneto-electric arrangements to be explained in the fourth section are excited by the powers of such apparatus.|$|E
