60|$|With these, thoughts, he {{cautiously}} sprung {{the iron}} under foot, peeped in, and, seeing all clear, boldly re-entered the apartment. He {{went straight to}} a high, narrow door in the opposite wall. The key was in the lock. Opening the door, there hung several coats, small-clothes, pairs of silk stockings, and hats of the deceased. With little difficulty Israel selected from these the complete suit {{in which he had}} last seen his once <b>jovial</b> <b>friend.</b> Carefully closing the door, and carrying the suit with him, he was returning towards the chimney, when he saw the Squire's silver-headed cane leaning against a corner of the wainscot. Taking this also, he stole back to his cell.|$|E

[...] "Therefore do I sigh amid this festive music. And besides, dear Edgar, I {{struggle}} as with a dream, and fancy that these shapes of our <b>jovial</b> <b>friends</b> are visionary, and their mirth unreal, {{and that we are}} no true Lord and Lady of the May. What is the mystery in my heart?" ...|$|R
60|$|His servitors salamed; his chieftains bowed; his yeoman-guard, in meadow-green, {{presented}} palm-stalks,--royal tokens; {{and hand}} in hand, the nodding, <b>jovial,</b> regal <b>friends,</b> went up a lane of salutations; dragging behind, a train of envyings.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Algernon Jarvis, of San Francisco, got up cross. The {{world of}} Mr. Jarvis {{had gone wrong}} with him overnight, as one's world is likely to do when one sits up till morning with <b>jovial</b> <b>friends,</b> to watch it, and he was prone to resentment. No sooner, therefore, had he got himself into a neat, fashionable suit of {{clothing}} than he selected his morning walking-stick and sallied out upon the town with a vague general determination to attack something. His first victim would naturally have been his breakfast; but singularly enough, he fell upon this with so feeble an energy that he was himself beaten--to the grieved astonishment of the worthy rôtisseur, who had to record his hitherto puissant patron's maiden defeat. Three or four cups of café noir were the only captives that graced Mr. Jarvis' gastric chariot-wheels that morning.|$|R
5000|$|New Noise Magazine writer Jesse Striewski wrote [...] "...those {{who enjoy}} their metal laced with an {{abundance}} of quotes from cheesy action flicks should not be let down." [...] Gregory Heaney of AllMusic wrote [...] "Although the schtick can wear a bit thin at times, musically Triple Brutal is a solid album ready-made for the mosh pit, and those looking to get some cathartic metal that doesn't take itself too seriously, or maybe just a little more of The Governator, into their lives won't be disappointed." [...] D.X. Ferris of MetalSucks wrote [...] "Unlike its predecessors, Triple Brutal does not sound like a funny guy and his <b>jovial</b> <b>friends</b> enjoying themselves. Compared to Double Brutal, B3 is grittier, but in a way that seems at odds with the band’s core concept. Regardless of your position on Lambesis, Triple Brutal isn’t going to make you laugh. And if an album full of Schwarzenegger impressions and skits isn’t fun, what’s the point?" [...] John Jackson of The Metal Resource reported [...] "Overall, this is probably the best of the ADM albums from an overall song quality standpoint. Nothing will ever top hearing “Get to the Choppa” for the first time, but from start to finish, Triple Brutal is filled with fast, driving metal that can help anyone who is “looking {{a little bit like a}} noodle” get some “gymspiration” to get in “One More Rep”." ...|$|R
60|$|R. Jones {{was about}} fifty years old, gray-haired, of a mauve complexion, <b>jovial</b> among his <b>friends,</b> {{and perhaps even}} more jovial with chance acquaintances. It was {{estimated}} by envious intimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, specially with young men of the upper classes, with large purses and small foreheads--was worth hundreds of pounds a year to him. There was something about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner that irresistibly attracted {{a certain type of}} young man. It was his good fortune that this type of young man should be the type financially most worth attracting.|$|R
60|$|The collector's instinct, {{strong in}} Darwin from his childhood, as {{is usually the}} case in great naturalists, turned itself in the {{direction}} of Insects during his residence at Cambridge. In childhood it had been damped by the moral scruples of a sister, as to the propriety of catching and killing insects for the mere sake of possessing them, but now it broke out afresh, and Darwin became an enthusiastic beetle collector. Oddly enough he took no scientific interest in beetles, not even troubling himself to make out their names; his delight lay in the capture of a species {{which turned out to be}} rare or new, and still more in finding his name, as captor, recorded in print. Evidently, this beetle-hunting hobby had little to do with science, but was mainly a new phase of the old and undiminished love of sport. In the intervals of beetle-catching, when shooting and hunting were not to be had, riding across country answered the purpose. These tastes naturally threw the young undergraduate among a set of men who preferred hard riding: to hard reading, and wasted the midnight oil upon other pursuits than that of academic distinction. A superficial observer might have had some grounds to fear that Dr. Darwin's wrathful prognosis might yet be verified. But if the eminently social tendencies of a vigorous and genial nature sought an outlet among a set of <b>jovial</b> sporting <b>friends,</b> there were other and no less strong proclivities which brought him into relation with associates of a very different stamp.|$|R
