500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Next, they {{recorded}} {{a song that}} Barrett had written in a few minutes, [...] "Here I Go", which required no overdubs at all. This session for [...] "No Man's Land" [...] and [...] "Here I Go" [...] lasted just three hours. When {{asked if he had}} any new songs for the following week's session, on 23 April, Barrett's replied that he had [...] "a weird idea <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out" [...] and that other musicians would not be required. Afterwards, Barrett mentioned that he was interested in revisting one of the Jenner tracks − [...] "Rhamadam". On the morning of the 23rd, Barrett arrived at the studio with a cassette player, on which he had recorded motorbike sounds; these, he told Jones, were [...] "all ready to [...] put onto the 'Rhamadam' four track". The producer described the sound quality as [...] "terrible", an opinion that was confirmed once Barrett's player had been hooked up to a 4-track machine. Instead it was decided that Barrett should source the motorbike sounds from EMI's large sound effects library. The selection process took up to an hour, at which point Jones started to lose faith in Barrett. Later on, Barrett changed his mind and abandoned the idea.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{broadcast}} of Imaishi's previous project, Gurren Lagann, the show's staff {{went on a}} trip for rest and relaxation. At that time, they aired their opinions to each other under drunken and humorous circumstances, saying such things as [...] "Next time, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> this" [...] in approaches to animation. Almost all of the concepts for the anime was made during the initial trip; the names of main characters, [...] "Panty" [...] and [...] "Stocking", were coined at the very first meeting. Hiromi Wakabayashi, who provided the initial idea for the series, cited American adult animation, such as Drawn Together, as inspiration for the show's crudeness.|$|E

2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> the {{audience}} <b>to</b> feel like they're reading a novel with moving illustrations", Wisit said. [...] "It's pure imagination and completely unrealistic. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{and go back}} <b>to</b> our roots. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make {{a link between the}} traditional and the contemporary in our own style." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aaron {{decided to}} modify his {{approach}} to quad jumps, stating in August 2016: [...] "I'm using an inside three turn (entrance). ... It's kind of old school in a way, but it's been working. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something new because obviously the three-turn wasn't working under pressure." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{evening was}} at the period when reserve is thawed. One of us {{mentioned}} three Würzburgers to the waiter; the dark-haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by {{a smile and a}} nod.

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you are right, Aunty; but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> for myself; and if I fail, I'll come back and follow your advice. Young folks always have discontented fits, you know. Didn't {{you when you were}} a girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not; but I don't quite {{relish the}} dirty work of {{cleaning}} out a rabbit before cooking it, so <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> the plan of cutting it open, holding it under water, and scraping out the inside while in that position." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My big {{influences}} at {{the time}} were my love for the spy genre and Japanese Anime films... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something in those genres, not only because I love them but because there weren't any other books like that {{at the time}}.

5000|$|In 2006 Everett {{published}} a memoir, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, {{in which he}} reveals his six-year affair with British television presenter Paula Yates. Although he is sometimes described as bisexual, as opposed to homosexual, he described his heterosexual affairs during a radio show with Jonathan Ross {{as the result of}} adventurousness: [...] "I was basically adventurous, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> everything".|$|R
5000|$|In a Rain Taxi interview, Hoenigman {{explains}} that Burn Your Belongings was an experimental {{work in the}} sense that he had no idea what the outcome would be: [...] "I had some theories and some things <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try,</b> and <b>I</b> just let it fly from there[...] [...]artistic result is my attempt to present this chaos in a manageable form, like a piece of music." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in English and is centred on the {{translation}} from Italian into English of {{some parts of the}} detective novel "Una mutevole verità" by Gianrico Carofiglio. For my translation I chose three chapters in which the author used the so-called "officialese", the language used to write official documents, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reproduce this kind of language in English. First of all the author and the Italian source text are presented, and the main features of officialese are outlined. Then follows the translation itself and the analysis of the translating choices...|$|R
5000|$|I {{also like}} singing in {{different}} ways. I get really annoyed {{when people are}} like, “So what kind of singer are you?” That just seems so limiting to you as an artist—I like to sing operatic, in jazz, soul, blues, I’m up for everything. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and showcase that across the album and be a different character for each song and have different instruments ... <b>I</b> just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that dynamic approach.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is a fair}} proffer," [...] replied Henry; [...] "but gold nor gear {{will never}} buy that harness. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> my own sword on my own armour, and I will not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon these terms." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to bassist/singer Randy Jackson, jazz fusion is an {{exceedingly}} difficult genre to play; [...] "I … picked jazz fusion because I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> become the ultimate technical musician-able to play anything.

5000|$|... "I don't know! I {{got sick}} of the songs. When I would play them onstage, I was just like, 'Oh my gosh, I can't play these anymore.'
