5|$|Leonardo {{had many}} <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> now renowned either {{in their fields}} or for their {{historical}} significance. They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book De divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella {{that appears to have}} been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.|$|E

The duo was independently scouted by the beautiful NSS agent, Choi Seung-hee (Kim Tae-hee). Unaware they have been scouted, the two were secretly captured and subjected through a simulated torture test, and both passed their test to be worthy NSS agents. In the process, they also {{fell in love with}} Seung-hee, who has kept the scouting process a secret from them.|$|E

5|$|Balu plays continual pranks on Geetha, {{during the}} course of which he also falls in love with her. She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for her is real. Hurt, she brings her <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house. When her plan backfires and her friends start supporting Balu, she becomes spiteful and tells her parents to move forward with a planned marriage to Sekar (S. A. Ashokan), a relative and an air force pilot.|$|E
5|$|His father {{emigrated to}} New York in 1905. The {{rest of the}} family {{followed}} in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London. From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the East End of London. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish diaspora and {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, a quarter of its population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Growing up in the East End, Aaronson was part of a group of <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> today referred to as the Whitechapel Boys, all of whom were children of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg, Joseph Leftwich, Samuel Winsten, Clara Birnberg, David Bomberg, and the brothers Abraham and Joseph Fineberg. Aaronson was also involved in the Young Socialist League, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics. Aaronson remained a committed socialist throughout adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Jandamarra's {{life has}} been the subject of two novels, Ion Idriess's Outlaws of the Leopold (1952) and Mudrooroo's Long Live Sandawarra (1972). Mudrooroo's novel, in {{counterpart}} to Idriess's, was written for an Indigenous audience to bring to their attention a hero of their own and cuts between the story of Jandamarra (called Sandawarra) and the contemporary story of young urbanised Sandy and his <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> inspired by Jandamarra.|$|E

500|$|In the anime Cowboy Bebop, {{the main}} {{characters}} have a super-intelligent Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Ein, on their ship. The Top Shelf graphic novel Korgi plays on the folklore tradition of the Corgi as a faerie draft animal.

500|$|Additionally, {{the singer}} {{acknowledged}} that the term [...] "Renaissance Man" [...] is given to artistic individuals like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, but that the female equivalent has never existed. She claimed the release serves as [...] "an ode" [...] to her <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> [...] "good at doing everything at once". She speaks of the dedication in lines such as [...] "I can be an engine / Buzzing like a bee / I'm a real independent". Both the lyrics and production were considered reminiscent of Oh Land's previous work, according to Sam Lansky of Idolator.|$|E

500|$|Wings {{was one of}} {{the first}} to show two men kissing: when several aviators are {{presented}} medals by a French general and are ceremonially pecked on their necks, and a fraternal moment between Rogers and Arlen during the deathbed finale. Marcel Danesi remarks that the Rogers-Arlen kiss was [...] "really not a romantic kiss, reverberating more with the desperate love between two dear <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> about to be separated by death", but speculates that the [...] "lingering" [...] aspect of the kiss may have [...] "unconsciously started the process of opening up America's rigid moral attitudes at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Lazarus Leonard Aaronson [...] (18 February 1895â€“ 9 December 1966), often {{published}} as L. Aaronson, was a British poet and a lecturer in economics. As a young man, {{he belonged to}} a group of Jewish <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> today known as the Whitechapel Boys, many of whom later achieved fame as writers and artists. Though less radical in his use of language, he has been compared to his more renowned Whitechapel friend, Isaac Rosenberg, in terms of diction and verbal energy. Aaronson's poetry is characterised as more post-Georgian than modernistic, and reviewers have traced influences from both the English poet John Keats, and Hebrew poets such as Shaul Tchernichovsky and Zalman Shneur.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} {{encouraged}} to explore the wider game world to find Chinpokomon toys or new <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> added to the character's Facebook page. Collecting friends allows the player to unlock perks that permanently improve the New Kid's statistics, providing extra damage or resistance to negative effects. The character's Facebook page also serves as the game's main menu, containing the inventory and a quest journal. The Stick of Truth features several mini-games, including defecating by repeatedly tapping a button that rewards the player with feces that can be thrown at enemies to trigger the [...] "grossed out" [...] effect, performing an abortion, and using an anal probe. Some of these scenes are absent from some versions of the game because of censorship.|$|E

500|$|Regular Show is an American [...] {{animated}} comedy {{television series}} created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network. It ran from September 6, 2010 to January 16, 2017, concluding {{with a total}} of 261 episodes through eight seasons. The series revolves around the lives of two <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> 23 [...] â€“ a blue jay named Mordecai (Quintel) and a raccoon named Rigby (William Salyers) â€“ both of whom are employed as groundskeepers at a local park. Regular Show depicts their daily routines at work and usual attempts to slack off, which often result in surreal misadventures.

500|$|Author Ian Inglis {{identifies}} Harrison's use of {{the plural}} form [...] "we" [...] in the lyric as evidence of his hope for [...] "a shared and sensible outcome" [...] for the former Beatles, since the situation [...] "disadvantages them all". While Harrison biographer Dale Allison interprets a degree of animosity towards the other Beatles in the song's lyrics, Leng argues that they are directed solely at the legal profession. Inglis similarly dismisses the idea that Harrison was targeting his former bandmates; instead, the song expresses [...] "frustration rather than hostility" [...] and addresses the [...] "absurdity" [...] of the situation. Inglis writes of [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues": [...] "It makes clear that amid the legal arguments, financial requirements, and technical language... there are four former <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> powerless to control events." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{defensive}} segment {{within the}} battle system {{was inspired by}} the Mario & Luigi series, as well as bullet hell shooters such as the Touhou Project series. When working on the battle system, Fox set out to create a mechanic that he would personally enjoy. He wanted Undertale to have a battle system as equally engaging as Super Mario RPG (1996) and [...] (2003). Fox did not want grinding to be necessary at any point in the game, instead leaving it optional to players. He also did not wish to introduce fetch quests, as they involve backtracking, which he dislikes. In terms of the game's difficulty, Fox ensured that it was easy and enjoyable. He asked some <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> inexperienced with bullet hell shooters to test the game, and found {{that they were able to}} complete it. He felt that the game's difficulty is optimal, particularly considering the complications involved in adding another difficulty setting.|$|E
