5|$|Until this time, cell-mediated <b>immunity</b> and humoral <b>immunity</b> were {{considered}} to be contending theories to explain effective immune response, but the former lagged behind owing to lack of advanced techniques. Cell-mediated <b>immunity</b> got an impetus in its recognition and study when in 1942, Merrill Chase successfully transferred <b>immunity</b> against tuberculosis between pigs by transferring white blood cells.|$|E

5|$|Foreign states {{generally}} enjoy <b>immunity</b> from lawsuits in the United States {{under the}} Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign government. Prior to {{enactment of the}} FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the <b>immunity</b> of foreign states on a case-by-case basis. By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the <b>immunity</b> of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's <b>immunity</b> from the executive branch to the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral <b>immunity</b> and {{cellular}} <b>immunity.</b> Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral <b>immunity</b> were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of <b>immunity</b> called passive <b>immunity.</b> Passive <b>immunity</b> is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E

5000|$|Hohfeld's {{original}} analysis {{included two}} {{other types of}} right: besides claims (or rights proper) and liberties (or privileges), he wrote of powers, and <b>immunities.</b> The other two terms of Hohfeld's analysis, powers and <b>immunities,</b> refer to second-order liberties and claims, respectively. Powers are liberty rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. the U.S. Congress has certain powers to modify some of U.S. citizens' legal rights, inasmuch as it can impose or remove legal duties. <b>Immunities,</b> conversely, are claim rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. U.S. citizens have, per their Constitution, certain <b>immunities</b> limiting the positive powers of the U.S. Congress to modify their legal rights. As such, <b>immunities</b> and powers are often subsumed within claims and liberties by later authors, or grouped together into [...] "active rights" [...] (liberties and powers) and [...] "passive rights" [...] (claims and <b>immunities).</b>|$|R

5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this <b>immunity</b> extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental <b>immunity.</b> On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental <b>immunity</b> under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental <b>immunity</b> should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} vaccine are used {{throughout}} the world to combat polio.

5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing <b>immunity</b> to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, <b>immunity</b> had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E
50|$|Intergovernmental {{organizations}} {{are provided with}} privileges and <b>immunities</b> that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties {{that give rise to}} the organization (such as the Convention on the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> of the United Nations and the Agreement on the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> of the International Criminal Court), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the International Organizations <b>Immunities</b> Act in the United States). The {{organizations are}} thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.|$|R
2500|$|Rehnquist {{distinguished}} the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> {{from the}} Dormant Commerce Clause by explaining {{that while the}} Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine to prevent economic protectionism, the Privileges & <b>Immunities</b> Clause is an actual Constitutional text to protect people’s rights. Thus, since the clauses have two distinct purposes, the “market participant” exception {{did not apply to}} the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> analysis. [...] Camden could pressure public works contractors to hire city residents without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause, but this did not allow the city to escape scrutiny under the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> Clause. [...] However, Rehnquist went on to explain that the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> Clause did not bar all potentially discriminatory acts by a state or political subdivision.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a series of {{inquiries}} being made to ascertain the extent and practical usefulness of the part played by Asian nations in their individual and collective contribution to the norms-formulating functions of Asian States as members of the global community. The current paper is confined to the three areas of jurisdictional <b>immunities</b> in the practice of States under contemporary international law. The first part relates to Asian practice and the practice of other nations affecting Asian communities in regard to the <b>Immunities</b> of States and their Property from the jurisdiction of other national entities. The second part deals with the current practice of diplomatic and consular <b>immunities,</b> available also to ad hoc or Special Missions. The third part concerns the <b>immunities</b> accorded by States to international organizations or in connection with the exercise of their official functions. The final part contains concluding observations calling for meticulous care and attention to find a practical approach to {{the nature and extent of}} <b>immunities</b> needed and the necessity to maintain a delicate balance between the interests of the donors and recipients of <b>immunities</b> so as to avoid possible abuses. Asian and non-Asian nations alike are equally grantors and beneficiaries of <b>immunities</b> under review...|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{author of}} the Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause was Congressman John Bingham of Ohio. The common {{historical}} view is that Bingham's primary inspiration, at least for his initial prototype of this Clause, was the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> Clause in Article Four of the United States Constitution, which provided that [...] "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> of Citizens in the several States".|$|R

5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong <b>immunity</b> to that type, but only short-term <b>immunity</b> to the others.

A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of William I, Urse became {{involved}} in a dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over {{the rights of the}} sheriff in the lands of the diocese. By the time of Domesday Book in 1086, Urse's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the Oswaldslaw, the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester. Domesday Book records that the Oswaldslaw was regarded as an <b>immunity,</b> exempt from judicial actions by royal officials. Urse complained that this <b>immunity</b> reduced his income, but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan, who prevailed. Although Wulfstan claimed that the <b>immunity</b> dated from before the Conquest, it actually owed its existence to the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters, and thus influence the findings of the court.|$|E

40|$|What {{was meant}} by the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause? Did it {{incorporate}} the U. S. Bill of Rights against the states or did it do something else? This article examines a much wider range of evidence than the debates from the late 1860 s, and it thereby recognizes that those debates discussed an idea that was already widely familiar. On the other hand, rather than assume that all pre- 1868 discussions of privileges and <b>immunities</b> matter for understanding the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause, it focuses on the line of discussion that led directly {{to the adoption of}} this clause. The privileges and <b>immunities</b> of citizens of the United States were discussed in different contexts, in different ways, and with different meanings, and it is therefore essential to focus on the genealogy and meaning of the specific ideas that actually led to the Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause...|$|R

500|$|The Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause, {{which protects}} the {{privileges}} and <b>immunities</b> of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and <b>Immunities</b> Clause of Article IV, which protects the privileges and <b>immunities</b> of state citizenship from interference by other states. In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), the Supreme Court {{concluded that the}} Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national citizenship" [...] and [...] "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the Privileges or <b>Immunities</b> Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and <b>immunities</b> possessed by virtue of national citizenship. The Court concluded that the privileges and <b>immunities</b> of national citizenship included only those rights that [...] "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws." [...] The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, {{the protection of the}} federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration. This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times. Largely {{as a result of the}} narrowness of the Slaughter-House opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.|$|R

King Charles I of Hungary granted <b>immunity</b> to the Saxon communities of Birthälm (Berethalom, Biertan), Kleinschelken (Kisselyk, Şeica Mică), and Mediasch (Medgyes, Mediaș) in 1315, but the same monarch annulled other communities' similar privileges in 1324.
