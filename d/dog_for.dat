5|$|The French Spaniel {{was little}} known outside France and {{neighboring}} countries {{until it was}} introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular <b>dog</b> <b>for</b> hunting woodcock and grouse.

5|$|The Giant Schnauzer was {{originally}} bred as a multipurpose farm <b>dog</b> <b>for</b> guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad <b>Dog?</b> <b>For</b> he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou {{the wife of}} Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time. The menagerie was {{open to the public}} by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or <b>dog</b> <b>for</b> feeding to the lions. A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century. The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV, and animals transferred to the London Zoo, which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828.|$|E

5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play. Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad <b>Dog</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Ex parte Crow Dog, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States that followed {{the death of one}} member of a Native American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land. Crow Dog {{was a member of the}} Brulé band of the Lakota Sioux. On August5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow <b>Dog</b> <b>for</b> murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. The Supreme Court held that unless authorized by Congress, federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. Crow Dog was therefore released. This case was the first time in history that an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the Major Crimes Act in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the plenary power legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit tribal sovereignty.|$|E
