5|$|On August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein sent an invading {{force of}} Iraqi troops <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> According to the United States {{government}} Hussein's forces would continue south into Saudi Arabia's oil fields. The United States military deployment to Saudi Arabia, Operation Desert Shield, grew rapidly {{to become the}} largest American deployment since the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990, during Operation Desert Shield, paratroopers {{from the}} unit {{protected}} the XVIII Airborne Corps' left flank during the subsequent Operation Desert Storm. It then advanced {{on the western}} flank of the invasion force along with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and other units of the XVIII Airborne Corps, striking some of the deepest incursions into Iraq of the war. The Division eventually advanced to Tallil {{while the majority of}} the attacking force moved <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The formation earned its first campaign streamers for this action.|$|E
5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E

50|$|On August 28, 1990, the Kuwaiti {{territory}} {{was transformed}} <b>into</b> the <b>Kuwait</b> Governorate, Iraq's 19th province, {{and thus it}} was formally annexed. Iraq's refusal to withdraw from Kuwait led to the Persian Gulf War, and on 26 February 1991 the pre-occupation government was returned to power.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E
25|$|Later, Iraq and Kuwait met {{for a final}} {{negotiation}} session, which failed. Saddam {{then sent}} his troops <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> As tensions between Washington and Saddam began to escalate, the Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev, strengthened its military relationship with the Iraqi leader, providing him military advisers, arms and aid.|$|E
25|$|The British Army also {{deployed}} 24 TOW-armed Lynxes alongside {{an equal}} number of Westland Gazelle helicopters during the Gulf War. They were assigned the mission of locating and attacking Iraqi tank concentrations, and to support the advance of coalition ground forces <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and Southern Iraq during the 100 hours war phase of the conflict. On 26 February 1991, a Lynx of 654 Squadron AAC destroyed two MTLB armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and four T-55 tanks using TOW missiles: the engagement was the first recorded use of the missile from a British helicopter.|$|E

Statistical modelling demonstrated significant increases for dissolved nutrients over the time period. Kuwait marine waters have been subject to inputs from urban development, untreated sewage discharges and decreasing river flow from the Shatt al-Arab River. Chlorophyll biomass showed a small but significant reduction; the high sewage content of the coastal waters from sewage discharges likely favouring the presence of smaller phytoplankton taxa.

500|$|On 14 January 1991 in Tunis, {{the night}} before U.S. forces moved <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> the ANO assassinated Abu Iyad, head of PLO intelligence, along with Abu al-Hol, Fatah's chief of security, and Fakhri al-Umari, another Fatah aide; all three men were shot in Abu Iyad's home. The killer, Hamza Abu Zaid, confessed that an ANO {{operative}} had hired him. When he shot Abu Iyad, he reportedly shouted, [...] "Let Atif Abu Bakr help you now!", {{a reference to the}} senior ANO member who had left the group in 1989, and whom Abu Nidal believed had been planted within the ANO by Abu Iyad as a spy. Abu Iyad had known that Abu Nidal nursed a hatred of him, in part because he had kept Abu Nidal out of the PLO. But the real reason for the hatred, Abu Iyad told Seale, was that he had protected Abu Nidal in his early years within the movement. Given his personality, Abu Nidal could not acknowledge that debt. Seale writes that the murder [...] "must therefore be seen as a final settlement of old scores." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Operation Desert Shield {{involved}} a sea interdiction campaign that saw international warships detaining and inspecting tankers from Iraq. As the buildup continued, Schwarzkopf was occupied with planning an offensive operation against the Iraqi units along the border, sometimes working 18-hour days in planning, assisted by a close group of aides. He frequently met with subordinates and Saudi commanders. Schwarzkopf planned counters both for Iraq's large armored forces and air forces, {{as well as}} its elite Republican Guard forces. While planning, Schwarzkopf remained in frequent contact with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell (both Vietnam veterans) concerning Schwarzkopf's plans for the offensive. Schwarzkopf devised an operational plan, dubbed [...] "Operation Desert Storm," [...] to be based on overwhelming force and strong infantry attacks supported by artillery and armor. It incorporated the desert warfare strategies used by British commander Bernard Montgomery in his defeat of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel at the Second Battle of El Alamein in World War II. By November 8, Bush agreed to commit 400,000 U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia at Schwarzkopf's insistence. Schwarzkopf believed larger numbers of troops would reduce the likelihood of high casualties. He planned a strategic bombing campaign to precede an offensive <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> simultaneously striking the forward Iraqi forces and their supply lines. In the meantime, diplomatic solutions began to break down, and the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, January 15, 1991, passed without a solution.|$|E
500|$|Schwarzkopf {{began his}} ground {{campaign}} in earnest at 04:00 on February 24, with the Saudi-led Arab forces attacking <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait</b> City, while two U.S. Marine Corps divisions struck at the oil fields, and the VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps {{on the left}} flank struck quickly {{to cut off the}} Iraqi forces from the west, which would later be known as his [...] "Left Hook" [...] strategy. Schwarzkopf expected the war to last several weeks, and had anticipated chemical weapon attacks by the Iraqi forces, which did not occur. Resistance was lighter than Schwarzkopf expected, and Iraqi troops surrendered in large numbers. Within 90 hours, his force had destroyed 42 of 50 Iraqi Army divisions {{at a cost of about}} 125 killed and 200 wounded among American troops, and about 482 killed, 458 wounded among all of the coalition. He ordered his forces to destroy as much Iraqi armor and equipment as possible in order to ensure the country's military would be weakened in the long term. Schwarzkopf, who had ordered a media blackout during the ground offensive, finally appeared before journalists on February 27 to explain his strategy. On March 3 he arrived in Kuwait City to survey the aftermath of the Iraqi occupation and negotiate a ceasefire with Iraqi military leaders, as well as work out the return of prisoners of war on both sides. With this in place, he then began the process of overseeing U.S. troops returning from the conflict.|$|E

In 1990-1991, upwards of 50 French Gazelles were deployed as part of France's contribution to coalition forces during the First Gulf War; during the subsequent military action, known as Operation Desert Storm, HOT-carrying Gazelles were employed by multiple nations, including Kuwait's air force, against Iraqi military forces occupying neighbouring Kuwait. During the coalition's offensive <b>into</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> French Gazelles adopted a tactic of continuous waves strafing enemy tanks, vehicles, and bunkers during high speed passes.|$|E

2500|$|Relations {{between the}} United States and Iraq {{remained}} tense following the Gulf War.

Also during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the [...] "Iraqi no-fly zones" [...] (Operation Desert Fox), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16–19 December 1998. After two years of intermittent activity, U.S. and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in February 2001.
