40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

50|$|Electric <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{typically}} low power (35 watt) incandescent lamps running off of low voltage DC current or, more recently, high output LED arrays. Incandescent signals use a doublet lens combination to directionally focus their small power {{out over a}} long range (3,500 feet in <b>daylight.)</b> New LED <b>signals</b> may either use an unfocused array or act as a drop-in replacement behind a traditional lens. U.S. signal lenses have a standard diameter of 8.375 in. North American signals use a standard set of colors, defined in October 1905, and which became common to other modes of transportation as shown on page 384 of the Simmons-Boardman 1911 Signal Dictionary.|$|R
40|$|The use of clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> on automobiles, {{motivated}} {{largely by}} styling considerations, has prompted interest in {{whether there are}} any safety consequences associated with these lamps. In a previous report (UMTRI- 98 - 2), {{it was found that}} under bright, sunny conditions, luminance contrast between the off and on states of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is smaller than for lamps using amber lenses. On the other hand, color contrast between the off and on states is greater with clear-lens turn signals. An experiment was conducted to compare the reaction time of drivers to <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> using clear and amber lenses. The results indicate that luminance contrast is the primary characteristic influencing driver performance and that no compensatory advantage appears to be obtained with increases in color contrast. This result is also consistent with evidence from basic research on visual search...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a radio failure or {{aircraft}} not equipped with a radio, or in {{the case of}} a deaf pilot, air traffic control may use a <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> to direct the aircraft. The <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colours: red, white and green. These colors may be flashed or steady, and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground. Planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings, moving the ailerons if on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness.|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Huey, Dekker, and Lyons (1994) {{concluded}} that a difference between two <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> intensities of less than 25 % cannot be detected reliably by most drivers. Consequently, Huey et al. recommended that an intensity difference of 25 % {{be used as a}} criterion for inconsequential noncompliance with federal regulations for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The present study was designed to evaluate just noticeable differences for glare intensities of oncoming low-beam headlamps. The results of this study indicate that, under controlled conditions, just noticeable differences in the low-beam headlighting context are between 11 % and 19 %. In real-world conditions, just noticeable differences would probably be somewhat larger. Therefore, the recommendation by Huey et al. of using 25 % as a criterion for inconsequential noncompliance of <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is also about right for low-beam headlamps, at least with respect to how headlamps themselves are perceived by other drivers (such as discomfort glare). The 25 % value may also apply with respect to how headlamps affect the ability of drivers to see illuminated objects, but further research on that issue would be desirable...|$|R

50|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{faced by}} an attacking force {{in a trench}} battle was unreliable communications. Wireless communications were still in their infancy, so the available methods were telephone, telegraph, semaphore, <b>signal</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>signal</b> flares, homing pigeons and runners.

50|$|A <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> (sometimes {{called an}} Aldis lamp, after Arthur Cyril Webb Aldis who invented a widely used design, or a Morse lamp) is a visual {{signaling}} device for optical communication, typically using Morse code. Modern <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are focused lamps which {{can produce a}} pulse of light. In large versions, this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted {{in front of the}} lamp, either via a manually operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically. With hand held lamps, a concave mirror is tilted by a trigger to focus the light into pulses. The lamps were usually equipped with some form of optical sight, and were most commonly used on naval vessels and in airport control towers (using color signals for stop or clearance).|$|R
40|$|Current {{photometric}} requirements for some <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> in the U. S. are based om {{the number of}} &quot;ligfited sections &quot; that comprise the lamp intensity requirements are somewhat higher for lamps with more sections, partially adjusting for the presumably larger lighted area of a lamp with more sections, and thereby establishing some control of luminance. The number of sections {{is used as a}} proxy for area, {{based on the assumption that}} lamps will be constructed with optical units of a certain approximate size, each with a single incandescent bulb of relatively high candle power. However, recently there has been growing interest in, and in some cases use of, a greater variety of sources for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps,</b> including LEDs, neon tubes, miniature halogen bulbs, and distributive light sources. The relationship between number of lighted sections and surface area that could be assumed for lamps with relatively large incandescent bulbs cannot be extended to the new sources. Therefore the way in which photometric standards address the areas or luminances of <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> must be reassessed. This document reviews the existing research that is relevant to the roles of lighted sections and area in signal-lamp performance, presents the findings from a new experiment, and offer...|$|R
