60|$|After I {{went up to}} my room <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> It {{was only}} about ten o'clock, but I looked upon a silent town. The drizzle continued, {{spangled}} with dim lights, as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the Ladies' Exchange.|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{ten o'clock}} the silver dollars {{dropping}} {{on the bar}} slowed down to playing two-steps and marches instead of jigs. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at Bird City Savings and Loan Co., and I knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>Looked</b> <b>Out</b> into <b>the</b> Morning (1951); {{words by}} James Thomson (B.V.) ...|$|R
60|$|I sighed as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window {{toward the}} jewelers' shops.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} again. A nameless fear crept over me, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{sat down}} and went on playing. The Trimble gang had a roughhouse for sure. They were getting good and drunk. They'd drink a while and holler a while, and then they'd shoot up a few bottles and glasses. Two or three times they came and tried to open our door. Then there was some more {{shooting}} outside, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again. Ham Gossett, the town marshal, had a posse in the houses and stores across the street, {{and was trying to}} bag a Trimble or two through the windows.|$|E
60|$|The {{change from}} storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark and {{sluggish}} hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last. Suddenly {{an influx of}} light filled my house, though the evening was at hand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and lo! where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, {{as if it had}} intelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance, the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not forget for many a thousand more--the same sweet and powerful song as of yore. O the evening robin, {{at the end of a}} New England summer day! If I could ever find the twig he sits upon! I mean he; I mean the twig. This at least is not the Turdus migratorius. The pitch pines and shrub oaks about my house, which had so long drooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter, greener, and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain any more. You may tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very wood-pile, whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled by the honking of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers getting in late from Southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I could hear the rush of their wings; when, driving toward my house, they suddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first spring night in the woods.|$|E
5000|$|Bertil Grandinson, {{who lives}} {{on the top floor}} of the house, explained: [...] "We woke up at half past two by a terrible bang. It was as if an {{aeroplane}} crashed. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and noted then to my great surprise that the train had run into the house. It is terrible and very shocking".|$|E
60|$|June 20th.--Eight o'clock. The sun {{is shining}} in a clear sky. I have not been near my bed--I have not once closed my weary wakeful eyes. From the same window at which <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> {{darkness}} of last night, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> now at <b>the</b> bright stillness of the morning.|$|R
40|$|The {{world around}} us is full of {{constantly}} unfolding dynamic events: as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window from my study, a car is honking, birds are flying, two friends are crossing the street, {{and the sun is}} moving behind the clouds. To successfully interact in the world, we must track and interpret a rich array of events to relate them to others. How do w...|$|R
5000|$|Owen told Billboard {{that the}} song was written {{while they were in}} Pennsylvania. [...] "We'd been playing guitars on <b>the</b> bus, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window...and said it's a sad-lookin' moon tonight,' and Teddy said, 'Wow. Let's write that song.' So Teddy, Greg, and I just went to working on it, and things just kind of fell together, as good songs and good {{feelings}} often do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cox was {{detained}} in 1977: [...] When they came, I was preparing an {{issue on the}} birthday of the queen of Holland. I made them wait until I was finished, then I called Maud to let her know. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw a (Ford) Falcon and a Peugeot with a sunroof, with the driver who looked like a Mexican bandido, with crossed bandoliers. They took me to Coordinación Federal through the basement, {{and as soon as}} I arrived, I saw a big swastika on the wall. They put me in a cell, without clothes, a kind of tube. It was a very strong experience. I did not know it at the time, but when they detained me, there was strong international pressure. I had my contacts. Tex Harris, who was a super guy, a diplomat from the USA who had been sent by Jimmy Carter and Patricia Derian, did {{a lot of work to}} free me.|$|E
5000|$|The Solomons {{first meet}} the Big Giant Head in person {{when he arrived}} by plane at their local airport, in an {{obviously}} agitated state. When asked about his flight, he responded [...] "Horrifying, at first. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and ... I saw something on the wing of the plane", to which Dick responded [...] "The same thing happened to me!" [...] This is a double reference. In an early episode, Dick attempts to fly {{for the first time}} and is frightened when he sees something on the wing of the plane. Both references are also to the Twilight Zone story [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", which tells of a man on a commercial flight who is convinced he sees a creature on the plane's wing which no one else can see. Both William Shatner and John Lithgow (Dick) had previously played that Twilight Zone character; Shatner played it in the original 1963 TV series episode, and Lithgow played it in the 1983 movie remake.|$|E

5000|$|Using the {{royalties}} {{she received}} {{from her first}} two albums, she {{bought a house in}} rural England close to her parents' home in Yeovil. She described her new home as [...] "completely in the countryside. I have no neighbors. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, all <b>I</b> see are fields." [...] Living in near isolation, she began writing the songs that would appear on To Bring You My Love.|$|R

6000|$|... "Still keeping silence, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> sea. <b>I</b> don't know why, {{except that}} <b>I</b> instinctively <b>looked</b> {{anywhere}} rather than look at him.|$|R
5000|$|Early in 1955 Stockhausen {{received}} a commission from WDR {{for a new}} orchestral composition, but his ongoing work on Gesang der Jünglinge prevented him from starting right away. In August and September, he {{took the opportunity to}} retreat to an inexpensive rented room in the attic of a parsonage in Paspels, Switzerland, recommended to him by a colleague, [...] Surrounded by the splendour of the Graubünden alps, he created the entire plan of Gruppen, [...] "with a completely new conception of musical time" [...] The surroundings provided more than just a conducive environment for work. in Gruppen ... whole envelopes of rhythmic blocks are exact lines of mountains that I saw in Paspels in Switzerland right in front of my little window. Many of the time spectra, which are represented by superimpositions of different rhythmic layers—of different speeds in each layer—their envelope which describes the increase and decrease of the number of layers, their shape, so to speak, the shape of the time field, are the curves of the mountain's contour which I saw when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Recording {{the album}} in 1987, the {{recording}} sessions for the album, which spanned nine months, began at Swanyard Studios, London for a week, followed by [...] "a place in Hoxton", before the band recorded {{for two weeks}} at the famous Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany, only {{two years before the}} fall of the Berlin Wall. Chris Salmon said [...] "It was an amazing place, I’m so glad we did it just before the wall came down. It had a faded grandeur; I think it was a brothel at some time." [...] Stephen Street was the engineer for the band at Hansa, but he soon had to leave the sessions to work on Morrissey's debut album Viva Hate. The first person the band met at Hansa Studios was Nick Cave, who was recording Tender Prey. Salmon recalled [...] "Hansa was great, I think the first person we met was Nick Cave, we had been up for 48 hours and we arrived and opened the doors and there's a very well-spoken nattily dressed gentleman. [...] "Was that Nick Cave?" [...] "Yeah it was, wasn’t it?" [...] I think he had just finished Kicking Against the Pricks." [...] McKahey recalled [...] "Berlin in 1987, really exciting, the wall was up. It was a very Bohemian city, an incredible scene, the clubs were open all night, it had a real sense of danger. I can remember when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the studio I was looking directly into no-man's land at a Russian soldier on his wooden plinth." ...|$|E
60|$|When I had done, he shaded his face, and {{continued}} silent. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window {{for a little}} while, and occupied myself with the plants.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I {{glanced at}} <b>the</b> newspaper; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> pleasant Southern garden, where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows, and laurels, orange-trees, and myrtles.|$|R
60|$|That {{night as}} {{we were going to}} bed <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window at the barn which {{contained}} the cow, and was astonished to see that there was a light inside of the building.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> room window, but all I could see was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> waited, <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{window and}} {{wondering}} who the man was, anyway.|$|R

60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> upon <b>the</b> calm sea, {{which lay}} like {{a sheet of}} glass, without a ripple on its surface, I could {{scarcely}} believe what he had said. But before many minutes had passed I was convinced of my error.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dame Durden's {{approving}} face," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> box {{in which}} I was packing his books, [...] "was not very visible {{when you called}} it by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can't do better." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hoga was moored {{with other}} yard service craft near the drydocks at 1010 Dock when Pearl Harbor was {{attacked}} by Japanese forces {{on the morning of}} 7 December 1941. Ten of Hogas eleven-man crew were aboard; the cook was ashore. As the planes swooped in over the harbor, Assistant Tugmaster Robert Brown, sleeping in the pilothouse, was awakened by the dropping bombs. [...] "I raised up and <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> and all hell was breaking loose. I saw planes all over the place. Japanese planes and several ships on fire." [...] Chief Boatswain's Mate Joseph B. McManus, the Tugmaster, was shaving in his cabin. [...] "I heard <b>the</b> noise and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole...and the first sight I saw was the Oklahoma which had quite a list. She had been hit ... The Chief Engineer was standing on the dock and I heard him say, 'My God! This is war! ...|$|R

5000|$|Of further {{interest}} are original papers and quotes from Alfred William Howitt {{who was a}} family friend show his perspective on the Bay {{and the beauty of}} the land and sea at [...] "The Seat". [...] "The Bay is covered with a haze as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out...</b> <b>the</b> smell of new hay comes in at the windows...a few hundred yards below the house is a belt of huge honeysuckle wattles, tea tree and she oaks edging the beach... over the tops you see the bay as smooth as a pond and six miles off are the heads and a blue broken ridge of hills." ...|$|R
60|$|His Chinese {{house is}} by the fire; and he lies within it, on his bed of flannel, querulously trying to sleep. The bright moon is high and clear. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> night, my tears fall fast, and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavily--heavily.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> open window. The moon still shone brightly on that {{angle of}} the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, <b>look</b> where <b>I</b> would, I could see no foothold, nor {{as much as a}} crevice in the brick-work.|$|R
60|$|We {{drove off}} ten minutes later. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> motor as we swung round {{into the main}} thoroughfare. Behind {{the window of the}} little sitting room I saw the pale, almost ghastly face of Lord Porthoning. He caught my eye and waved his hand weakly.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the vital}} riddle of our time. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> upon <b>the</b> windy Channel {{and think of}} all those {{millions}} just over there, who seem to get busier and keener every hour. I could imagine the day of reckoning coming like a swarm of birds.|$|R
5000|$|... “When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> crowd, <b>I</b> {{could see}} that the Hungarians, the Italians, {{and the rest of the}} Europeans had all turned around. They went from not wanting my win to happen, to being forced to say in their hearts and souls, ‘Bravo. Bravo’. That, to me, was incredible.” ...|$|R
