This paper evaluates the techno-economic performance of a biorefinery system in which an existing {{combined heat and power}} plant integrates with the productions of bioethanol and pellets using straw as feedstock. A two-stage acid hydrolysis process for bioethanol production is used, and two different drying technologies are chosen for <b>drying</b> hydrolysis <b>solid</b> <b>residues.</b> A sensitivity analysis on critical parameters, such as the bioethanol selling price and feedstock price, is performed. The bioethanol production cost is also calculated for two cases at the conditions of ten-year and five-year payback time. The results show that the first case is a more feasible economic configuration at present, having an over 30 % production cost reduction compared with the conventional cogeneration plants of bioethanol and solid fuel...|$|R

The amendments included two immature composts: Compost A made with tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) residues, broiler litter and grape pomace; Compost B made with tea residues, rachis and grape pomace; and separately dried tea residues, grape pomace and broiler litter. These amendments were either incorporated or applied as cover to the substrate in 5 L pots {{at the beginning}} of spring. A chemical treatment with the nematicide fenamiphos and a control with substrate only were added for comparisons. The assay was composed of 11 treatments with six replicates, with a grape plant as experimental unit. Seven months later, the assessment of the treatments was carried out based on number of second stage juvenile, nodules, eggs per root gram and reproductive index. Fresh aerial and root plant weight were also measured. The chemical treatment presented the lowest final population of M. ethiopica. When evaluating the nematicide action of the organic amendments, compost A soil-incorporated and both grape pomace and <b>solid</b> <b>dry</b> tea <b>residue</b> as covers obtained low reproductive indexes, similar to the chemical treatment and control (P ≤ 0. 05).

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{some aspects}} of various separation technologies applied in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic materials. Bioethanol can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass using several different process configurations. The main energy-demanding process steps in lignocellulosic ethanol production are distillation to concentrate the ethanol, adsorption to remove the final content of water, and, optionally, evaporation either of the sugar solution before fermentation or of the stillage stream, as an option to anaerobic digestion, and <b>drying</b> of the <b>solid</b> <b>residue,</b> if this is required. The dehydration of ethanol using adsorption on zeolites is performed in two packed columns, where one is adsorbing water while the other is regenerated.

Liquid-liquid extractions {{were employed to}} generate six fractions, initially extracted by ethanol. Then, the aqueous solution of <b>dried</b> <b>solid</b> <b>residues</b> was sequentially fractionated by hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The EC 50 value, defined as the UV absorption of DPPH concentrations sufficiently decrease down to 50 % of the original value, was individually detected for six partitions. It was found that all peel portions have better effect on scavenging DPPH free radical than meat portions, especially for the ethyl acetate partition of the peel portion of Tai-nung # 2 Yam. Its EC 50 value (14. 5 µg/ml) was even {{lower than that of}} ascorbic acid (21. 4 µg/ml). There is no diosgenin found in three yams, however, there is 0. 11 wt% in one yam imported from China. Furthermore, semi-continuous hot pressurized ethanol (HPE) was superior to hot pressurized water (HPW) in extracting the compound scavenging DPPH radical from purpurea Roxb peel. The recovery of four unknown compounds was corresponding to the scavenging ratio of DPPH free radical in the HPE extract. Finally, three-level and four-factor experimental design discovered that ethanol ratio and temperature were the most effective factors in order. Pressure and solvent-to-feed ratio were relatively not significant. 80 % of aqueous ethanol, 20 (kg/kg) solid ratio, 180 psig, and 100 ℃ were found to be a suitable condition. 中文摘要 本研究首先以三種台灣產食用山藥為研究對象。探討皮和肉部分的萃出物對捕捉DPPH自由基的活性。乙醇索氏萃取的乾燥粗水萃液，相繼地再以正己烷、氯仿、乙酸乙酯、正丁醇進行液-液萃取。每一種液-液分層物與DPPH自由基反應後的濃度下降到 50 %原始吸收值時定義為EC 50 ，其值愈低，代表具高抗氧化性。結果發現，三種山藥皮部份之各分層對於DPPH自由基的清除率，均優於肉的部分。特別是台農二號山藥皮的乙酸乙酯的分離層，呈現 14. 5 µg/ml的EC 50 值。但是三種山藥均無法檢測出山藥皂素。大陸進口的藥用茅淮山藥卻含有 0. 11 %的山藥皂素。再者，吾人利用半連續式熱壓水與熱壓乙醇分別萃取紫玉血薯山藥皮的抗DPPH自由基成份。熱壓乙醇萃取抗DPPH成分的效率優於熱壓水萃取，且熱壓乙醇萃出液中四未知成份的回收率對應於DPPH的清除率。最後，吾人採取四種變數(乙醇比例、溶固比、壓力、溫度) 的L 9 實驗設計法發現，在 80 %的乙醇、 20 (kg/kg) 的溶固比、 180 psig和 100 ℃的萃出液對於清除DPPH自由基有最好的效果。經由統計分析顯示，乙醇的比例和萃取溫度分別是首要及次要因子。TABLE OF CONTENT 中文摘要 [...] .

40|$|International audienceNuclear {{decontamination}} {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} the decommissioning of facilities, can today be carried out using gelled reagents sprayed over contaminated surfaces (tens of square meters) and allows easy radionuclide retrieval. Wide ranges of formulations have been developed in our laboratory to treat several materials. The gels are formulated by adding colloidal silica particles to a reactive solution; they <b>dry</b> and form <b>solid</b> <b>residues</b> that are easily collected and directly conditioned. Dissemination hazards are reduced and no liquid effluent is generated or released. In order to adapt the process to the decontamination of small items, an original method involving a topping gel has been developed. A polysaccharide, carrageenan, is added to a conventional gel (silica particles + reactive solution) and by varying the temperature an abrupt sol-gel transition (around 45 - 50 degrees C) is observed. At high temperature, the low viscosity of the gel allows it to coat small parts easily, and simply removing them from the warm bath congeals the topping gel. Its decontaminating action takes place. The gel then dries and can be collected. A tradeoff has been found between the mineral mass fraction {{and the amount of}} carrageenan, and a formulation is proposed. Results on Co- 60 contaminated black steel plates show that the decontamination factor is fully comparable to a conventional gel. Finally, drying kinetic measurements show that easily recoverable flakes are formed due to water evaporation...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) and correlate the sludge characteristics {{in terms of}} soluble organic compounds with polymer demand (PD) during sludge conditioning. The PD required to achieve maximum dewatering of the ADS studied is {{in the range of}} 8 - 10 kg polymer/dry ton. The commonly used capillary suction time parameter to evaluate the solid-liquid separation ability was not a reliable indicator for assessing dewatering. Instead, in this study, a modified centrifugal technique proposed by Higgins (Higgins MCT) was used to assess the maximum achievable <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content of the biosolids cake. The Higgins MCT is readily obtained using a bench-scale centrifuge equipped with a modified centrifuge bucket. Using the Higgins MCT, the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> contents obtained from conditioned ADS was 30 wt%. These values were comparable to the <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content obtained from the same sludge at full-scale level. Our results suggest Higgins MCT is suitable for assessing the final <b>dry</b> <b>solids</b> content and simulating the dewatering process...|$|R
