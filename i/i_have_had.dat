25|$|Know, good reader, {{that this}} towne of Shrewsbury, {{the place of}} my birth and {{residence}} is greatly troubled with a sect of men and women, with whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much intercourse of concernment, not by way of intimate familiarity approving their ways, but of vexation and trouble of minde, that I could not, in thirteene yeares painfull ministry among them, reclaime them from their wandring fancies, and reduce them to obedience to Supreme majestie, in the persons of two most illustrious and royal kings.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
60|$|Immediately the {{pangs of}} hunger and thirst began to assail me. Where before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> but a mild craving {{for food and}} drink, I now {{actually}} suffered for want of it, and all because of the tantalizing sight that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> of food almost within my grasp.|$|R

25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|Ladies and Gentlemen I {{accept the}} flowers as a memento of {{reconciliation}} {{between the white}} and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as {{it comes from a}} colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. (Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E
25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no choice except to write my way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had,</b> in {{the last}} four years, the advantage, if it be an advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from which the student of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was so thrilling as this: to wait and {{struggle}} among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine—poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all—the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realisation of powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair—all this for seventy minutes by the clock with only four inches of twisted iron work to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one hand—safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.|$|E
25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> two {{children}} {{by him and}} no more, for, to tell the truth, it began to be {{time for me to}} leave bearing children, for I was now eight-and-forty, and <b>I</b> suppose if he <b>had</b> lived <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no more.|$|R
500|$|After Chesnutt read several {{compliments}} {{from friends}} and in various newspaper reviews, he wrote to editor Walter Hines Page, [...] "taking it all in all, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a slight glimpse of what it means, I imagine, {{to be a successful}} author." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, I suppose. But they were actually quite rotten and false, abusive to me. What I am doing now is learning to fall in love with myself." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, BBC News {{reported}} that the law firm have announced they are to stop [...] "chasing illegal file-sharers".

500|$|Hugo Black {{was also}} a {{one-time}} member of the Ku Klux Klan as revealed by journalist Ray Sprigle of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who uncovered Black's handwritten resignation from the Klan on July 9, 1925. When confronted with the evidence that Hugo Black {{had been a member}} of the Klan, he responded in part: [...] "Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do with it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{departure}} from the Grand Fleet, the king had a message sent to the officers and men of the ships he had just left. It began with a warm reference to the American squadron: [...] "I am happy to have found myself once more with the Grand Fleet, and this pleasure has been increased by the opportunity <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> of seeing the splendid ships of the United States in line with our own, and of meeting Admiral Rodman together with the officers and men under him.

500|$|... that {{an agent}} of Colombia's Cali Cartel had contributed US$51,000 to Pérez Balladares' presidential campaign. After briefly {{threatening}} to sue for libel and calling the report [...] "journalistic terrorism", Pérez Balladares later stated {{that it had been}} correct, describing it as [...] "the first time, perhaps in my life, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to swallow my words." [...] When Gorriti's work visa expired the following year, however, the Panamanian government refused to renew it, triggering a storm of criticism from international press NGOs and domestic opposition parties. Under pressure, the Pérez Balladares government later relented, and Gorriti's visa was renewed.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Bell {{announced}} that he had quit as producer of Last of the Summer Wine. Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, [...] "I have now decided I will not do it again. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special. However, on 26 June 2009, the BBC {{announced that}} it had recommissioned the show for a 31st series with Bell continuing as producer and director.|$|E
500|$|Like Harford, Graham had issues {{selecting}} his side, {{going as}} far to say [...] "it's the hardest line-up <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to choose." [...] Already without O'Leary, Graham {{was waiting for}} Paul Davis to pass a fitness test before finalising his first eleven; the England international had caught a virus {{a week before the}} final and subsequently missed training. Arsenal defender Gus Caesar, who deputised for O'Leary, relished the challenge of being up against Harford: [...] " [...] is aggressive, but I'm not worried. I played with Tony Adams for two years in the youth team. We can always draw on that experience. It's instinctive." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 29, 2002, Harisu filed a {{petition}} with the Incheon District Court {{to have her}} sex corrected on her family register, and that her birth name be changed from Lee Kyung-yeop to the more feminine Lee Kyung-eun. The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became only the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex. Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: [...] "My most embarrassing moments were when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn't get a passport, visa or even my own bank accounts because I was legally a man".|$|E
