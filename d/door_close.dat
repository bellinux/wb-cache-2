500|$|Mulder finds a small {{splinter}} {{of fresh}} wood embedded in Mr. Baiocchi's neck, and matches the fragment {{to a tree}} outside the Baiocchi home. A short time later, the agents are approached {{by a man named}} Ramirez, who claims that the trees are all dying because of a [...] "very bad man." [...] Meanwhile, Karin invites Lisa to stay at her home until her aunt can pick her up the following day. As Lisa listens from her bedroom, she overhears an argument between Karin and a male voice. When she descends into Karin's root cellar, she discovers the skeletal body of a man. Terrified, Lisa turns towards the door, only to have the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> and lock.|$|E
2500|$|Those in {{the second}} floor dress circle {{had to contend with}} stairs. The main flight led to the lobby and {{eventually}} the Washington Street exit; a second flight led to the Flood's Alley side <b>door</b> <b>close</b> to Johnson Street. Most favored the main flight because it was {{the way in which they}} had first entered the circle and were already familiar with it. The stairway was over [...] wide, and, according to Jackson's estimates, should have emptied the dress circle in under three minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Prism Rail was {{purchased}} by National Express in September 2000, and the franchise was rebranded as c2c once the Class 357/0 units were in service. The second batch of 28 Class 357/2 units were ordered {{at a cost of}} £92 million by c2c in 2000 primarily to replace the remaining Class 312 units. Construction started in 2001, and they were delivered between September 2001 and May 2002. They are owned by Angel Trains and leased by c2c, at an initial cost of £900 a day (including rental and maintenance). Due to the rebranding, they have a white livery with grey doors, and are internally branded to the c2c purple colour scheme with magenta handrails, magenta stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors with c2c branding: [...] "culture2club2commuters2culture2club2", and a light grey linoleum floor with white, dark grey and light purple flecks. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is above the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button, which is above the door open button, unlike in the 357/0 units. These units were fitted with DVA with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first batch}} of 44 Class 357/0 units were ordered {{at a cost}} of £200 million by Prism Rail in March 1997 to replace the Class 310 slam-door units, and allow the return of 18 hired Class 317 units to their other {{franchise}} West Anglia Great Northern. Construction started in 1999, and they are currently leased by c2c from Porterbrook. They were built in the green LTS Rail colour scheme, painted with a white livery with dark green doors and underskirt (bottom body panels). Their interior consists of dark green seat moquette with alternating rows of large flecks of light blue and light green, light green plastic seat tops with slots in the side for reservation tickets (which are not used) with dark green insets, a stone pattern linoleum floor, purple plastic interior, light green handrails and metal luggage racks with large circular perforations and light green edges, and dark green stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is in between the interior door buttons, with the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button above and the door open button below, unlike in the 357/2 units. These units were fitted with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|E
