50|$|Granuloma inguinale (also {{known as}} <b>donovanosis)</b> is a {{bacterial}} disease caused by Klebsiella granulomatis (formerly known as Calymmatobacterium granulomatis) characterized by ulcerative genital lesions. It is endemic in many less developed regions. It {{is also known}} as <b>donovanosis,</b> granuloma genitoinguinale, granuloma inguinale tropicum, granuloma venereum, granuloma venereum genitoinguinale, lupoid form of groin ulceration, serpiginous ulceration of the groin, ulcerating granuloma of the pudendum, and ulcerating sclerosing granuloma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first known}} {{name for this}} {{condition}} was [...] "serpiginous ulcer", which dates to 1882. The proper clinical designation for <b>donovanosis</b> is now [...] "granuloma inguinale". A granuloma is a nodular type of inflammatory reaction, and inguinale refers to the inguinal region, which is commonly involved in this infection. The disease {{is commonly known as}} <b>donovanosis,</b> after the Donovan bodies which are a diagnostic sign.|$|E
50|$|Klebsiella granulomatis is Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium of {{the genus}} Klebsiella known to cause the sexually transmitted disease granuloma inguinale (or <b>donovanosis).</b> It was called Calymmatobacterium granulomatis.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} {{effectively}} treated with antibiotics, therefore, developed countries {{have a very}} low incidence of donovanosis; about 100 cases reported {{each year in the}} United States. However, sexual contacts with individuals in endemic regions dramatically increases the risk of contracting the disease. Avoidance of these sexual contacts, and sexually transmitted disease testing before beginning a sexual relationship, are effective preventative measures for <b>donovanosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The disease {{often goes}} {{untreated}} {{because of the}} scarcity of medical treatment in the countries {{in which it is}} found. In addition, the painless genital ulcers can be mistaken for syphilis. The ulcers ultimately progress to destruction of internal and external tissue, with extensive leakage of mucus and blood from the highly vascular lesions. The destructive nature of <b>donovanosis</b> also increases the risk of superinfection by other pathogenic microbes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the patient's sexual history and on physical examination revealing a painless, [...] "beefy-red ulcer" [...] with a characteristic rolled edge of granulation tissue. In contrast to syphilitic ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy is generally mild or absent. Tissue biopsy and Wright-Giemsa stain are used to aid in the diagnosis. The presence of Donovan bodies in the tissue sample confirms <b>donovanosis.</b> Donovan bodies are rod-shaped, oval organisms that {{can be seen in the}} cytoplasm of mononuclear phagocytes or histiocytes in tissue samples from patients with granuloma inguinale.|$|E
50|$|Charles Donovan MD (19 September 1863 - 29 October 1951) was an Irish {{medical officer}} in the Indian Medical Service.

He graduated in medicine from Trinity College, Dublin and joined the Indian Medical Service. He participated in British expeditions to Mandalay in Burma, Royapuram and Mangalore in India, Afghanistan, and finally Madras (now Chennai), where he spent the rest of his service.

40|$|<b>Donovanosis</b> is a {{genital ulcer}} disease that {{occasionally}} has extragenital manifestations. This report describes {{a case of}} disseminated <b>donovanosis</b> in a 54 -year-old woman from northern Australia who had subsequent thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis and spinal cord compression.

40|$|<b>Donovanosis,</b> {{a chronic}} cause of genital ulceration, has {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} renewed interest after a long period of relative obscurity. The causative organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, has been cultured {{for the first time in}} many years and a polymerase chain reaction diagnostic using a colorimetric detection system has been developed. Phylogenetic analysis confirms close similarities with the genus Klebsiella and a proposal made that C granulomatis be reclassified as Klebsiella granulomatis comb nov. Azithromycin has emerged as the drug of choice and should be used if the diagnosis is confirmed or suspected. In <b>donovanosis</b> endemic areas, syndromic management protocols for genital ulceration may need to be adapted locally. A significant <b>donovanosis</b> epidemic was reported in Durban from 1988 â€“ 97 but the current status of this epidemic is unclear. The <b>donovanosis</b> elimination programme among Aboriginals in Australia appears successful and is a model that could be adopted in other <b>donovanosis</b> endemic areas. Overall, the incidence of <b>donovanosis</b> seems to be decreasing. Increased attention would undoubtedly be paid to <b>donovanosis</b> if policy makers recognised more readily the importance of genital ulcers in fuelling the HIV epidemic...|$|E
40|$|A {{five year}} study of <b>Donovanosis</b> from 1 - 1 - 1 % 2 to 31 - 12 - 1966 at the Govt. General Hospital Guntur is presented. 25796 cases of venereal {{diseases}} were seen {{during the period}} out of which 867 cases were of <b>Donovanosis</b> giving a percentage of 3. 36 % which is the highest incidence so far reported in the literature. 91. 48 % of cases {{were found in the}} age group 16 - 40 years which is the period of maximum sexual activity. The youngest patient in out series was 13 years and the oldest 60 years-of age. 20. 2 % was found in teenagers indicating the present high incidence of venereal diseases in the teenagers. 665 cases seen were males and 202 were females giving a male preponderance in a ratio of 3. 3 : 1. Some clinical problems and the close resemblance of <b>Donovanosis</b> to Epidermoid carcinoma are considered. In 63 % of the cases the incubation period ranged between 1 - 4 weeks which can be considered the average incubation period for <b>Donovanosis.</b> 54. 4 % of males and 56. 5 % of females were married and the probable reasons for the greater incidence of <b>Donovanosis</b> in the married of both sexes are suggested. In our series 14 cases of conjugal <b>Donovanosis</b> were seen. Conjugal <b>Donovanosis</b> is not rare, but difficult to detect for lack of examination of both the sexual paterns. In our experience true spontaneous cure of <b>Donovanosis</b> is unknown. The shortest duration of infection was 3 days and the longest duration was 9 years. 25 cases out of 867 were extra genital forming 2. 9 %. Commonest sites were the anal and perianal regions and in the majority due to perverted sexual practices. Two cases in our study had both <b>Donovanosis</b> and cancer and it was difficult to decide which was the earlier lesion. The drug of choice in the treatment of <b>Donovanosis</b> is streptomycin. We had 16 cases of streptomycin resistant <b>Donovanosis</b> treated successfully with Broad Spectrum Antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|<b>Donovanosis</b> is a {{predominantly}} tropical cause of genital ulcer occurring chiefly in small endemic foci in all continents except Europe. Diagnosis requires the careful collection, staining and examination of smears or biopsies of characteristic genital and, occasionally, extragenital lesions for {{demonstration of the}} pathognomonic Donovan bodies (Calymmatobacterium granulomatis) within histiocytes. Successful isolation of C. granulomatis has rarely proved feasible, the last report being in 1962. <b>Donovanosis</b> has a characteristic histopathological picture which occasionally simulates epithelioma. The antibiotics reported as showing good activity in <b>donovanosis</b> are those with good activity against gram negative bacilli and whose lipid solubility ensures good intracellular penetration. They include streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, lincomycin, cotrimoxazole and the tetracyclines. More recently, good results have been reported with norfloxacin and thiamphenicol. The treatment of <b>donovanosis</b> in pregnant women and patients with AIDS poses special problems. Complications of <b>donovanosis</b> such as elephantiasis, stricture and pelvic abscess may require surgery. Contacts should be traced for examination but only treated if lesions are found...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the epidemiological and clinical features of <b>donovanosis</b> and their {{relevance to the}} possible coincident risk of HIV- 1 transmission in patients attending an STD clinic. DESIGN: Assessment of patients with <b>donovanosis</b> diagnosed by the detection of Donovan bodies on tissue smears stained by the RapiDiff technique. SETTING: City Health STD Clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seventy one patients with <b>donovanosis.</b> RESULTS: Donovan bodies were detected in 171 (130 men, 41 women). Ulcers were present for longer than 28 days in 72 (55. 4 %) men and 19 (46. 3 %) women. Ninety five (55. 6 %) came from rural areas. Lesions were ulcero-granulomatous in 162, hypertrophic in eight and necrotic in one. Anal lesions were detected in one woman. Only one of 21 regular sexual partners examined was infected with <b>donovanosis.</b> Complete healing was observed in 41 (24 %) who attended for follow up. Extensive lesions were sometimes observed in pregnant women. Serological tests for syphilis were positive in 40 (23. 4 %). HIV- 1 antibodies were detected in 4 / 48 men and 0 / 15 women who underwent HIV testing. <b>Donovanosis</b> ulcers in three HIV- 1 seropositive men were cured by standard antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in presentation, extensive areas of genital ulceration and lack of co-existent infection with <b>donovanosis</b> among sexual partners were notable features. Primary health care facilities in rural areas {{do not appear to}} be providing an adequate service for patients with <b>donovanosis.</b> HIV control programmes should consider specific measures aimed at eradicating <b>donovanosis</b> in areas where the condition is prevalent...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{recent trends}} in {{reported cases of}} <b>donovanosis</b> (granuloma inguinale) in Durban, South Africa. DESIGN [...] The annual reports of the Medical Officer of Health for Durban 1958 - 1988 were reviewed to identify cases of <b>donovanosis,</b> genital ulcer disease (GUD) and new patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STD). A rapid staining technique {{for the detection of}} Donovan bodies was introduced in 1988. SETTING [...] City Health STD Clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban. RESULTS [...] An initial peak was identified in men 1969 - 1974. A second peak was recorded in 1988 when reported cases of <b>donovanosis</b> (313) were the highest since records commenced. Both peaks were unrelated to either increases in the numbers of new attenders with STD or patients with GUD. CONCLUSION [...] The recent increase in <b>donovanosis</b> in Durban may reflect either a new epidemic or under-reporting of a disease previously diagnosed on clinical grounds. Improved control of <b>donovanosis,</b> a condition sometimes causing extensive GUD, and which has been implicated in HIV- 1 transmission in local men, should be targeted in HIV control programmes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone sodium {{in the treatment of}} chronic <b>donovanosis,</b> and the acceptability to patients and staff of supervised outpatient treatment in rural clinics. METHODS [...] We collected demographic and sexual health data from participants using a standard questionnaire, and recorded their <b>donovanosis</b> lesions at baseline using genital diagrams. Treatment consisted of a single daily IM injection of 1 g ceftriaxone diluted in 2 ml of 1 % lignocaine. Clinic staff followed patients for between three and 12 months, enabling the detection of late recurrences. SETTING [...] Rural Aboriginal communities in central Australia. PARTICIPANTS [...] The study describes eight women and four men with chronic <b>donovanosis</b> in detail, and summarises the outcome in 12 additional cases. All cases presented with advanced lesions which had failed to heal on the standard oral antibiotic regimens used in the region. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of infection was 3. 0 years (SD 1. 9 years), and between four and ten courses of antibiotics had been prescribed for six of the 12 patients. Patients received between 7 - 26 g of ceftriaxone sodium. Clinical improvement was dramatic in most lesions, and four patients healed completely without recurrence after a total 7 - 10 g of ceftriaxone. Mild recurrences responded to further ceftriaxone or short courses of oral antibiotics. Treatment was well tolerated, and both patient and staff compliance high. CONCLUSION [...] <b>Donovanosis</b> is an important cause of chronic genital ulceration in central Australia, and is potentially an important risk factor for HIV transmission in Aboriginal communities. The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of ceftriaxone make it a useful and cost-effective agent in the ambulatory management of <b>donovanosis,</b> especially in remote communities. Supervised multidrug regimens of two or more long-acting agents may provide the best answer in <b>donovanosis,</b> administered through the existing health care infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} azithromycin, an azalide antibiotic with long tissue half-life, in a pilot study of patients with genital <b>donovanosis</b> in the Northern Territory, Australia. DESIGN: Patients with histologically confirmed <b>donovanosis</b> were randomised to receive one of two open-label azithromycin dosage regimens: Regimen A [...] 1. 0 g once weekly for 4 weeks; or Regimen B [...] 500 mg daily for 7 days. Patients were assessed at 6 weeks and classified as either "cured", "improved" or "failed". RESULTS: Seven patients received regimen A and 4 received regimen B. Six weeks after commencing treatment the genital ulcers of four patients receiving regimen A and one patient receiving regimen B had healed; the lesions of the other six patients (3 in each regimen) were "improved". No patient failed to respond and no significant adverse reaction was recognised. The eleven patients were reviewed after completing the six-week trial; all lesions had re-epithelialised without further antibiotic treatment, no relapses had occurred, the longest follow-up period being seven months. A further 17 patients with <b>donovanosis</b> who were unable to meet the entry criteria were also treated successfully with azithromycin during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This {{is the first time}} that azithromycin has been shown to have clinical activity against <b>donovanosis.</b> Poor compliance with prolonged courses of antibiotics is one of the major barriers to control of the disease. Intermittent or short-course therapy, made possible by the long tissue half-life of the drug, could facilitate control of <b>donovanosis</b> in endemic populations if the high cost of medication can be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Genital {{ulcer disease}} (GUD) is well {{recognised}} {{in the developing world}} as a co-factor for heterosexual HIV transmission. Men with GUD are an important high frequency HIV transmitter core group in the general population but few interventions have targeted such individuals so far. <b>Donovanosis</b> is an uncommon GUD with low infectivity characterised by large ulcers that bleed readily and has been identified as a risk factor for HIV in men in Durban, South Africa. <b>Donovanosis</b> is also endemic in Papua New Guinea, India, Brazil and amongst the Aboriginal community in Australia. This curious geographical distribution is unique to any of the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and might lend itself to control measures not tried previously. In the 1950 - 60 s a global eradication programme was successfully introduced against yaws but this strategy has not been implemented against any of the STD. <b>Donovanosis</b> is a symptomatic disease usually diagnosed on clinical grounds and could be targeted for eradication. Any programme would need to be community-based and require co-operation with both hospital doctors, private general practitioners, nurses, primary health care workers, pharmacists and traditional healers. <b>Donovanosis</b> is usually treated by readily available antibiotics but treatment failure may occur in advanced HIV disease. Drug compliance is often a problem but may be improved by counselling. Early implementation of an eradication programme targeting men with <b>donovanosis</b> could have a significant impact in limiting the spread of HIV in donovanosis-endemic countries and would pre-empt the possibility of both the emergence of drug resistance and treatment failure in individuals with immune impairment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Donovanosis</b> is a slowly progressive, granulomatous {{ulcerative}} disease, {{caused by}} Klebsiella (Calymmatobacterium) granulomatis. The disease {{is known to}} persist for years together, leading to complications. A male patient aged 30 years with underlying HIV- 2 infection presented {{to the department of}} STD with painful ulceration over the genital region of 5 months duration, with absence of penis. Tissue smear from the ulcer and histopathological examination revealed large histiocytes with intracellular Donovan bodies (Pund cell). A final diagnosis of <b>donovanosis</b> with auto-amputation of penis with HIV- 2 infection was made. The old conventional medicines, viz. streptomycin, doxycycline and amoxycillin, were effective. Though HIV- 2 infections are milder than HIV- 1 infections in all aspects, <b>donovanosis</b> in this HIV- 2 infected case presented with complications. However, since the CD 4 count was 748 cells/cmm, the severity is attributed to the long standing nature and negligence by the patient, and not to possible immunodeficiency...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and {{epidemiological}} {{observations on}} 87 cases of <b>donovanosis</b> seen at Port Moresby General Hospital are presented, with detailed reports of three {{cases in which}} the disease was more severe. The circumstances of infection described were consistent with venereal transmission. Chloramphenicol and gentamicin were effective in curing the disease, while streptomycin was found to be ineffective in a number of cases tested. Complement-fixation tests with Donovania antigen revealed the presence of antibodies in all but one of 23 cases tested, and in nine out of fourteen other patients who on clinical grounds were suspected of having <b>donovanosis</b> but were negative by smear test. The complement-fixation test with Klebsiella antigen was found to be highly specific for <b>donovanosis,</b> but less sensitive than the test using Donovania antigen. The intracellular location of Donovania in tissue and the presence of antibodies which are apparently not protective suggest that cell-mediated immunity may be important in defence against Donovania infection...|$|E
40|$|A clinico-eoidemiological {{study on}} 189 cases of <b>donovanosis</b> seen {{during the year}} 197 1 1973 is {{presented}} from the coastline climate of Pondicherry. A high prevalence rate of 6. 1 % has been met with. The disease could be convincingly demonstrated in 50 % of the sexual partners that could be examined and was shown in 15 couples i. e. in both the husband and wife. This shows beyond doubt the venereal origin of <b>donovanosis.</b> Streptomycin is the treatment of choice with cure rate of 90. 8 % in the treated cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} clinical diagnosis in genital ulcer disease (GUD); to devise management strategies for improving the control of GUD and thereby limit the spread of HIV- 1 infection. DESIGN [...] Clinical and microbiological assessment of GUD in men and women. The index of suspicion, diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic efficiency and positive and negative predictive values of a clinical diagnosis were investigated. SETTING [...] City Health Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS [...] 100 men and 100 women with genital ulcers. RESULTS [...] The accuracy of a clinical diagnosis was, in men: lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) 66 %, <b>donovanosis</b> 63 %, chancroid 42 %, genital herpes 39 %, primary syphilis 32 %, mixed infections 8 %, and in women; secondary syphilis 94 %, <b>donovanosis</b> 83 %, genital herpes 60 %, primary syphilis 58 %, chancroid 57 %, LGV 40 %, mixed infections 14 %. Overall, diagnostic efficiency was greater in women than in men. When compared with other causes of GUD, <b>donovanosis</b> ulcers bled to the touch and were larger and not usually associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy. In women, extensive vulval condylomata lata were readily differentiated from all other causes of GUD. CONCLUSION [...] A clinical diagnosis in genital ulceration was less accurate in men than in women. The diagnostic accuracies for <b>donovanosis</b> and secondary syphilis were relatively high but for most other conditions were low. Differences between clinical and laboratory diagnostic accuracies may reflect similarities between the clinical appearances of the various causes of GUD, the presence of mixed infections, atypical ulceration due to longstanding disease, and insensitive laboratory tests. In this community all large ulcers should be treated empirically for syphilis and <b>donovanosis.</b> Uncircumcised men with GUD are an important HIV core or "superspreader" group locally, and prevention strategies should include counselling and health education {{in the light of}} the inaccuracy of clinical diagnosis found in this study. The development of rapid accurate tests for GUD is urgently required...|$|E

SETTING [...] City Health {{sexually transmitted diseases}} clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS [...] 100 Zulu men with genital ulcers who had not received antibiotics in the previous four weeks. RESULTS [...] Syphilis was diagnosed in 42 %, chancroid in 22 %, <b>donovanosis</b> (granuloma inguinale) in 11 %, genital herpes in 10 % and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in 6 %. No pathogens were identified in 24 %. Mixed infections were detected in 14 men, in whom 13 had syphilis. Five men had HIV- 1 antibodies. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the ulcers and urethra in seven men and from the urethra alone in five. Scabies was diagnosed clinically in eight.

40|$|<b>Donovanosis</b> is {{a chronic}} {{ulcerative}} {{disease of the}} genitals and surrounding regions with endemic foci in socially disadvantaged populations throughout the world. In recent {{years there has been}} a resurgence of interest in this disease due to the association of genitoulcerative disease with an increased risk of HIV- 1 transmission and acquisition. The Australian government has a target to eradicate <b>donovanosis</b> by 2003. Diagnosis is problematic as the causative organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, cannot be cultured on conventional microbiological media and, until recently, has relied almost exclusively on the detection of typical histological features in tissue smears and biopsies. There is general consensus that the sensitivity of histology for the diagnosis of <b>donovanosis</b> is in the range 60 - 80 %. More recently, successful culture has been reported using fresh human monocytes and a human epithelial cell line though the utility of these techniques for routine and rapid diagnosis is limited. In contrast, molecular diagnostic techniques are of great utility in the detection of unculturable organisms. The main objective of this study was therefore to develop a sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic test for <b>donovanosis</b> and to then incorporate this test into a colorimetric detection system for use in routine diagnostic laboratories. To this end DNA was extracted from specimens clinically suggestive of <b>donovanosis</b> and a 604 -bp region of the phoE gene was amplified and sequenced. Results of this aspect of the study showed that there were only two unique base changes distinguishing C. granulomatis from subspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Extension of the sequence data to the almost complete phoE gene (1001 -bp) resulted in no additional changes being observed. In order to clarify the relationship between C. granulomatis and the Klebsiella genus sequence data was extended to include the 16 S rRNA (1088 -bp),gdhA (376 -bp) and iluK (772 -bp) genes. DNA similarity was shown to be in the range 98. 6 - 100 % across these four genes. Tree topologies and associated confidence levels of branching resulting from the use of a number of phylogenetic inferencing methods confirmed that C. granulomatis has a close phylogenetic relationship with the three subspecies of K. pneumoniae and it is proposed that C. granulomatis be reclassified as Klebsiella granulomatis comb. nov. As a further result of the phylogenetic aspect of the study it was shown that K. granulomatis appears to be missing the Klebsiella sucrose regulon. This enabled the development of a first-generation diagnostic PCR for <b>donovanosis</b> based on the presence of phoE and absence of the highly conserved scrA. However, this test was limited {{by the fact that it}} relied on a phoE+/scrA- result for positive diagnosis and so would give an indeterminate result if other Klebsiella were contaminating the lesion. A second-generation diagnostic PCR was subsequently developed based on the finding that the two unique base changes in the K. granulomatis phoE gene eliminated Haelll restriction sites. Through the use of a capture oligonucleotide covalently linked to tosyl-activated magnetic beads it was possible to modify the PCR-Haelll digest so that it could articulate with EIA-based PCR diagnostic systems for use in routine diagnostic laboratories. This test is now ready to be taken up in validation trials. Finally, the results of the study enabled the question of the habitat and transmission of K. granulomatis to be revisited. An analysis of the literature within the context of these results is strongly suggestive of the presence of an enteric asymptomatic carrier state that needs to be taken into consideration if the Australian government is serious about eradicating <b>donovanosis</b> from this country...|$|E

A donovanose Ã© considerada uma doenÃ§a sexualmente transmissÃ­vel, endÃªmica nas regiÃµes tropicais e semitropicais do globo. Apresentam tambÃ©m imagens de duas lÃ¢minas: uma da pesquisa direta (corpÃºsculos de Donovan, dentro de grandes cÃ©lulas mononucleadas coradas de vermelho pelo Giemsa) e outra de achados histolÃ³gicos tÃ­picos (formato de alfinete dentro do histiÃ³cito) The authors present {{images of}} two of the most common {{clinical}} forms of granuloma inguinale (<b>donovanosis)</b> in males and females. <b>Donovanosis</b> is considered a sexually transmitted disease that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Two microscopic images are also shown, one of a direct smear (the presence of Donovan bodies within large mononuclear cells identified using Giemsa stain) and the other of typical histological findings (rod-shaped Donovan bodies within a mononuclear histiocyte...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} {{microbial}} aetiology of genital ulcer disease (GUD) in women. DESIGN [...] Microbial and clinical assessment of genital ulcers in women. SETTING [...] City Health {{sexually transmitted diseases}} clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS [...] 100 Zulu women with genital ulceration who had not received antibiotics in the previous two weeks. RESULTS [...] Syphilis was diagnosed in 40 %, genital herpes in 18 %, <b>donovanosis</b> (granuloma inguinale) in 16 %, chancroid in 14 %, lymphogranuloma venereum in 7 % and scabies in 2 %. No recognised cause was detected in 18 %. Secondary syphilis was diagnosed in 21 %, primary syphilis in 16 % and mixed primary and secondary syphilis in 3 %. Multiple infections were detected in 13 women, of whom 12 had syphilis. Bleeding was observed from the ulcers of 59 during swab collection. Three women had HIV- 1 antibodies. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the ulcers and endocervix of two women and from the endocervix alone in nine. Generalised scabies was diagnosed in 14. CONCLUSIONS [...] All the major causes of GUD are prevalent in Zulu women in Durban: secondary syphilis was the commonest diagnosis. <b>Donovanosis,</b> which often presents late with large ulcers, and genital herpes are now significant problems. Mixed infections with coexisting syphilis are common. All women in this population with GUD should be treated for syphilis and receive oral antibiotics effective for chancroid and <b>donovanosis...</b>|$|E
