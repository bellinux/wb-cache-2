5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, <b>emotional</b> <b>abuse,</b> dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions. These functions include self-harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self-loathing. There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and <b>emotional</b> <b>abuse.</b> Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E

25|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>abuse</b> {{has been}} gaining more and more {{recognition}} {{in recent years as}} an incredibly common form of domestic violence (and therefore a human rights abuse) within the private home throughout developing nations such as India. Psychological abuse can erode a woman’s sense of self-worth and can be incredibly harmful to overall mental and physical wellbeing. Emotional/psychological abuse can include harassment; threats; verbal abuse such as name-calling, degradation and blaming; stalking; and isolation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>abuse</b> {{includes}} minimising, threats, isolation, public humiliation, unrelenting criticism, constant personal devaluation, repeated stonewalling and gaslighting. Stalking is {{a common}} form of psychological intimidation, and is most often perpetrated by former or current intimate partners. Victims tend to feel their partner has nearly total control over them, greatly affecting the power dynamic in a relationship, empowering the perpetrator, and disempowering the victim. Victims often suffer from depression, putting them at increased risk of eating disorders, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 study {{published}} in World Development, results from a survey pointed to a negative correlation between dowry amount and inter-spousal violence, indicating the potential dangers of a wife falling short on dowry payments or expectations. These dangers include not only common physical and <b>emotional</b> <b>abuse</b> such as hitting and continual degradation, {{but in some cases}} dowry death and bride burning {{as a result of the}} husband’s dissatisfaction with the dowry payment.

40|$|Unlike {{physical}} and sexual violence, less is known about <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse</b> in intimate relationships. In relation to the latter, {{there is no consensus}} on the definition, the methods of measurement, and the behaviours that constitute <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} contribute to the understanding of intimate partner violence by considering <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse</b> within heterosexual intimate relationships from the perspective of self-identified, abused women. More specifically, I analyse the behaviours that women consider to be emotionally and psychologically abusive, and the negative effects of that abuse. I examine how women became aware of such abuse in their intimate relationships and what type of support they received from formal and informal sources in response to their experiences. Using a feminist, phenomenological qualitative approach, I gathered this information through 20 in-depth interviews and questionnaires. I identified 35 emotionally and psychologically abusive behaviours and 22 negative effects, mostly consistent with previous research findings, but much more extensive than Australian domestic and family violence legislation. My findings indicate that <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse</b> needs more acknowledgment publicly. It needs to be identified in a more consistent manner in legislation and other related policy. My findings may help educate women and the general public on what constitutes <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse</b> in a more organised and clear manner. In relation to practice implications, my research suggests that there is a need for further training of formal and informal sources of support through professional and community education. This would include information with an emphasis on the harmful effects that <b>emotional</b> and psychological <b>abuse</b> can have on women’s mental, emotional and physical wellbeing, including social and financial impacts...|$|R
