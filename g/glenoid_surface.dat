40|$|Rotator cuff tears {{disrupt the}} force {{balance in the}} {{shoulder}} and the glenohumeral joint in particular, resulting in compromised arm elevation torques. The trade-off between glenohumeral torque and glenohumeral stability is not yet understood. We hypothesize that compensation of lost abduction torque {{will lead to a}} superior redirection of the reaction force vector onto the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface,</b> which will require additional muscle forces to maintain glenohumeral stability. Muscle forces in a single arm position for five combinations of simulated cuff tears were estimated by inverse dynamic simulation (Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model) and compared with muscle forces in the non-injured condition. Each cuff tear condition was simulated both without and with an active modeling constraint for glenohumeral stability, which was defined as the condition in which the glenohumeral reaction force intersects the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface.</b> For the simulated position an isolated tear of the supraspinatus only increased the effort of the other muscles with 8 %, and did not introduce instability. For massive cuff tears beyond the supraspinatus, instability became a prominent factor: the deltoids were not able to fully compensate lost net abduction torque without introducing destabilizing forces; unfavorable abductor muscles (i. e. in the simulated position the subscapularis and the biceps longum) remain to compensate the necessary abduction torque; the teres minor appeared to be of vital importance to maintain glenohumeral stability. Adverse adductor muscle co-contraction is essential to preserve glenohumeral stability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|Arthroscopy allows joint {{irrigation}} with {{removal of}} cartilage debris, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators [10]. Arthroscopic debidement associated with capsular release may provide significant pain relief and improve ROM in patents with capsular contracture of > 15 ° [31]. Just as other research findings have shown how osteochondral lesions of > 2  cm 2 are correlated with persistent pain as a predictive variable {{for the ultimate}} failure of the arthroscopic procedure [31], the patients with the worst outcomes in our study were those with large cartilaginous defects. Severe arthritis {{does not seem to}} be usefully treated with arthroscopy because of deteriorating outcomes over time and poor functional results [32, 33]. Shoulder arthritis is followed by progressive restriction of ROM due to the contracture of the capsule and deformity of the humeral head [16]. For a peripheral cartilage lesion, the restriction of the glenohumeral joint volume, the compression of the damaged <b>glenoid</b> cartilage <b>surface,</b> the pivot mechanism, and the eccentric loads can all promote squaring of the humeral head [12]. 360 ° capsulotomy reduces compression between the humeral head and the glenoid and can therefore lead to an improvement in the ROM. This procedure is mandatory in all cases involving an arthroscopic approach to stiff arthritic joints. Patients affected by degenerative joint diseases with residual joint space can improve shoulder function and obtain pain relief after arthroscopic debridement. The unchanged glenohumeral distance indicates that the arthritic process is stable, and biological resurfacing of the glenoid with an engineered hyaluronic acid membrane does not appear to lead to better outcomes than debridement and capsulotomy.|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionBone {{defects in}} the humeral head or antero-inferior {{edge of the}} glenoid cavity {{increase}} recurrence risk following arthroscopic Bankart repair. The present study sought to quantify such preoperative defects using a simple radiological technique and to determine a threshold for elevated risk of recurrence. Materials and methodsA retrospective study conducted in two centers enrolled patients undergoing primary arthroscopic Bankart repair for isolated anterior shoulder instability in 2005. The principle assessment criterion was revision for recurrent instability. Quantitative radiology comprised: the ratio of notch depth to humeral head radius (D/R) on AP view in internal rotation; Gerber's X ratio between antero-inferior glenoid cavity edge defect length and maximum anteroposterior glenoid cavity diameter on arthro-CT scan; and the D 1 /D 2 ratio between the <b>glenoid</b> joint <b>surface</b> diameters of the pathologic (D 1) and healthy (D 2) shoulders on Bernageau glenoid profile views. Seventy-seven patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 44 months (range, 36 – 54). ResultsOverall recurrence rate was 15. 6 %. Recurrence risk was significantly greater when the humeral notch length was more or equal to 20 % of the humeral head diameter and the Gerber ratio more or equal to 40 %. On Bernageau views, mean D 1 /D 2 ratio was 4. 2 % (range, 0 – 23 %) in patients without recurrence, versus 5. 1 % (range, 0 – 19) in those with recurrence (P= 0. 003). DiscussionBeyond the above thresholds, bone defect as such contraindicates isolated arthroscopic stabilization.

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{orientation}} of the pectoral girdle in vivo is uncertain, the scapulae and coracoids are generally {{thought to have been}} oblique to the major planes of {{orientation of the}} rest of the body, rendering orientational descriptors somewhat difficult to select. Aside from the glenoid region, which is damaged or missing in both specimens, the preserved parts of the left and right scapulae complement one another to give a full picture of the morphology of the element. The scapulae consist of a broad proximal plate comprising an acromion and acromial fossa and a blade that forms more than half the length of the bone. The lateral surface of the acromial plate is excavated anterior to the acromial ridge and dorsal to the glenoid region. The acromial ridge is slightly posteriorly deflected, such that it is oriented at an acute angle to the long axis of the scapular blade. Immediately posterior to the <b>glenoid</b> articular <b>surface,</b> the ventral margin of the scapula is broad and convex transversely, but rapidly narrows as it merges into the base of the blade. No prominent subtriangular process seems to occur along the posteroventral edge of the proximal scapula, though its absence could be due to damage. A broad ridge extends longitudinally along the proximal third of the lateral face of the blade. The dorsal margin of the blade is straight, whereas the ventral margin expands distally such that the ratio of the maximum to minimum blade dorsoventral height is 1.7, less than the originally described value of ca. 2.

40|$|Background: In a {{shoulder}} requiring arthroplasty, if the glenoid is flat or biconcave, the surgeon can restore the de-sired glenoid stability {{by using a}} glenoid prosthesis with a known surface geometry or by modifying {{the surface of the}} glenoid to a geometry that provides the desired glenoid stability. This study tested the hypotheses that (1) the stabil-ity provided by the glenoid is reduced by the removal of the articular cartilage; (2) the stability contributed by the glen-oid is compromised by loss of its articular cartilage, and this lost stability can be restored by spherical reaming along the glenoid centerline; and (3) the stability of a reamed glenoid is comparable with that of a native glenoid and with that of a polyethylene glenoid with similar surface geometry; and (4) the glenoid stability can be predicted from the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> geometry. Methods: The stability provided by the glenoid in a given direction can be characterized by the maximal angle that the humeral joint reaction force can make with the glenoid centerline before the humeral head dislocates; this quantity is defined as the balance stability angle in the specified direction.

40|$|Introduction Patients {{suffering}} from glenohumeral osteoarthritis may present an important wear of the glenoid articular surface {{leading to a}} new glenoid shape (Neoglenoid). The amount of wear to correct can thus be difficult to evaluate when a total shoulder arthroplasty is planned. Since the positioning of the glenoid component {{is known to be}} critical for the long term success of the surgery, {{it would be helpful to}} have an estimate of the glenoid shape before it was deformed by osteoarthritis (Paleoglenoid). Objectives The objective of this project was to evaluate the potential of statistical shape modeling to predict the shape of the articular <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> from the remaining parts of the scapula, which have not been affected by the glenoid degenerative wear. Methods To build a statistical shape model (SSM) of the scapula, CT scans of 64 scapulae without any sign of pathology were segmented. Segmented images were used to produce smooth three-dimensional surfaces of triangular meshes. The 64 meshes were then registered and combined into a SSM using the Statismo library. To evaluate the accuracy of the SSM prediction, we repeated the following six steps for each of the 64 scapulae. Step 1 : one of the 64 scapulae is selected. Step 2 : the SSM is built without this scapula (leave-one-out). Step 3 : the glenoid region of the selected scapula is removed. Step 4 : the SSM is fitted based on the remaining part of the scapula. Step 5 : the SSM predicts the removed glenoid region. Step 6 : the local accuracy of the SSM is evaluated by the distance between the predicted and existing glenoid surfaces. We compared a SSM with the full scapulae to a SSM with the lateral part only (from the spino-glenoid notch to the acromion and coracoid process). The orientation of the original and reconstructed glenoid were also assessed. Results When the SSM included the entire scapula, the lowest prediction accuracy of the reconstructed <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> reached 4 mm. When the SSM was based on the lateral scapula, the average accuracy reached 0. 6 ± 0. 1 mm. The accuracy of the glenoid orientation prediction was 2. 4 ± 1. 6 degree. Conclusions The proposed method allowed to predict the shape of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface,</b> which was here artificially removed. This prediction could be obtained from the lateral part of the scapula, glenoid excluded, which is not affected by wear caused by osteoarthritis. The accuracy of the reconstruction was below 1 mm, and thus acceptable for the preoperative planning of total shoulder arthroplasty. This method should help to improve the positioning of glenoid implants for severe glenoid wear, and eventually reduce the failure risk after total shoulder arthroplasty...|$|E

40|$|Glenoid {{component}} failure {{is the most}} common complication of total shoulder arthroplasty. Glenoid components fail {{as a result of their}} inability to replicate essential properties of the normal <b>glenoid</b> articular <b>surface</b> to achieve durable fixation to the underlying bone, to withstand repeated eccentric loads and glenohumeral translation, and to resist wear and deformation. The possibility of glenoid {{component failure}} should be considered whenever a total shoulder arthroplasty has an unsatisfactory result. High-quality radiographs made in the plane of the scapula and in the axillary projection are usu-ally sufficient to evaluate the status of the glenoid component. Failures of prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty can be understood in terms of failure of the component itself, failure of seating, failure of fixation, failure of the glenoid bone, and failure to effectively manage eccentric loading. An understanding of these modes of failure leads to strategies to minimize complications related to prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty. Failure of the polyethylene glenoid component {{is the most common}} complication of total shoulder arthroplasty and ac-counts for a majority of the unsatisfactory results after this procedure 1 - 9. Failure of the glenoid component is often man-ifested clinically by pain, loss of function, and the presence of a clunking noise and sensation 10, 11. While many factors have been described as possible contributors to glenoid component failure, a systematic understanding of these factors is lacking. As a result, the incidence of glenoid component failure remains high. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the current peer-reviewed evidence in a way that clarifies the modes of failure and that suggests strategies for addressing each of these modes.

Better knowledge of the arthritic glenoid cavity anatomy can help in developing new implants and techniques. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe and validate the reproducibility of a CT scan-based, 3 D measurement method used to describe various parameters characterizing arthritic glenoid cavity morphology. Materials and methodsTwelve CT scans and 29 CT arthrogram were evaluated. These scans were taken from 41 patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis who received an anatomical shoulder prosthesis. A 3 D reconstruction of the scapula was performed based on the DICOM files. Following the 3 D volume acquisition, points on the <b>glenoid</b> articular <b>surface</b> were manually extracted by three observers, each one three times, allowing one week between readings, to determine the inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated on five 3 D parameters that were automatically calculated: glenoïd height, glenoid width, height at maximum width glenoid version and radius of the articular surface best-fit sphere. ResultsThe intra-observer and inter-observer ICC were 0. 91 to 0. 99, and 0. 95 to 0. 99, respectively. DiscussionThis study is the first to report on a reproducible 3 D measurement method, based on CT scans, for the arthritic glenoid cavity, which derives the joint radius of curvature among other morphology parameters. These 3 D measurements are advantageous because they are free of problems related to patient positioning in the CT scanner and to the choice of slices, which limits the accuracy of measurements made on slices from 2 D CT scans. Three-dimensional methodology similar to ours has been validated on healthy glenoids. ConclusionThis study confirms the reliability and good reproducibility of our method, which allows us to extend this method to a larger patient cohort and adapt this automated technology to preoperative planning software.

40|$|To {{validate}} {{the assumption that}} the center of rotation in the glenohumeral (GH) joint can be described based on the geometry of the joint, two methods for calculation of the GH rotation center were compared. These are a kinematic estimation based on the calculation of instantaneous helical axes, and a geometric estimation based on a spherical fit through the surface of the glenoid. Four fresh cadaver arms were fixed at the scapula and fitted with electromagnetic sensors. Each arm was moved in different directions {{while at the same time}} the orientation of the humerus was recorded. Subsequently, each specimen was dissected and its glenoid and humeral head surfaces were digitized. Results indicate no differences between the methods.

Detailed knowledge of glenoid's intra-articular geometry, subchondral structure, regional bone density and extra-articular relationships is needed for future prosthesis design optimization. Three-dimensional computer models were generated from CT images of 12 pairs of male cadaver scapulae aged 50. 18 ± 11. 77 years, and 8 pairs of female cadaver scapulae aged 60 ± 20. 48 years. External glenoid morphological parameters measured included superior-inferior length, anterior-posterior width, and glenoid contour geometry (dimensions and angles). Internal morphological analysis included subchondral bone glenoid version measurement. Regional bone density measurements were made to determine glenoid cancellous bone distribution. Accuracy and reliability were defined using repeated measurements. The glenoid was pear shaped with superior-inferior length greater than anterior-posterior diameter. The inferior glenoid boundary was a 120 ° arc with average radius 11. 2 ± 1. 2 mm. The center of the arc (glenoid center) was located along the maximum superior-inferior length one-third this distance superior from infraglenoid tubercle and. <b>Glenoid's</b> articular <b>surface</b> version, and subchondral bone version averaged 2 ° ± 5 °, and 1 ° ± 4 ° of retroversion, respectively. Highest density bone was in posterior glenoid, medium density anteriorly, and low density in central glenoid. Accuracy and reliability were defined as mean difference between repeated and original computer model measurement (0. 5 ± 0. 7 mm for lengths and 1. 3 ° ± 4. 4 ° for angles). 3 -D computer modeling permitted internal morphological analyses, which {{for the first time}} defined entire glenoid structure. External morphological and bone density measurements agreed with previously reported data. Advanced imaging and computer modeling tools enabled an accurate and reliable structural analysis of the complexly shaped glenoid. Work described in this project will be used for future studies whose goals are improved glenoid prosthesis and surgical instrumentation design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cartilage {{and bone}} are {{specialized}} connective tissues composed of {{roughly the same}} material: cell embedded in an extracellular matrix, permeated by the network of fibers. Then the properties of cartilage are anisotropic and inhomogeneous structure. At the same time, the structure of cartilage is rather porous allowing fluid to {{move in and out}} of the tissue. Thus the properties of cartilage were changed with the fluid content. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the biomechanical properties of the pericellular matrix vary with depth from the coated cartilage surface, and observed regions of cartilage failure. This objective is achieved by solving problems with the finite element method. The conceptual model was subjected to the boundary conditions of confined compression on porous of cartilage anisotropy. The experimental results were demonstrated that neither the Young’s modulus nor the Poisson’s ratios exhibit the same values when measured along the loading directions. The results were supported an essential functional property of the tissue which the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> may be susceptible to cartilage degeneration...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a new bovid, Asoletragus gentryi n. gen. et sp., {{from the late}} Pliocene/early Pleistocene fossiliferous fissure fillings (Cava VI, 3) in the karst network at  Monte Tuttavista (Sardinia, Italy). It differs from other genera in its straight, almost conical, horn-cores, which diverge slightly from the sagittal plane, are very close together at their bases and slant strongly backwards (nearly parallel to the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> of the temporal bone). The very peculiar shape and position of these horn-cores render their phylogenetic relationship with other taxa from the Miocene of Europe and other circum-Mediterranean countries uncertain. Given the global features of the horn-cores {{and the absence of}} any alcelaphine-like tooth in the Monte Tuttavista samples, the hypothesis that Asoletragus belongs to an archaic "Caprinae" cannot be ruled out, despite the presence of quite a large frontal sinus rising through the pedicel and at least one-third of the horn-core proper. Pending the discovery of other fossils from this taxon, one may only hypothesize regarding its phylogeny.   SHORT NOTE</p...|$|E
40|$|Three partial skulls of odontocetes {{from the}} Miocene of Antwerp and Kessel, {{northern}} Belgium (southern North Sea Basin) are described {{here as a}} new genus and species of beaked whale (Ziphiidae), Archaeoziphius microglenoideus. This small new whale {{is one of the}} most archaic beaked whales, because of its low vertex, thin and laterally directed premaxillary crests, low contact between the supraoccipital and the frontals on the vertex, and its free atlas. It is also characterized by the strong transverse compression of the frontals on the vertex and a reduced <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> on the squamosal; the two last characters might be considered as derived. Nasals wider than the frontals on the vertex might group A. microglenoideus with the extant larger genera Berardius and Tasmacetus; the nodular frontals and the premaxillary crests are more similar to the condition in Berardius. A sediment sample from the cetacean-bearing strata at Kessel is dated with dinoflagellate cysts as middle Miocene, tentatively late Langhian to early Serravallian, i. e., from ca. 15 Ma to ca. 13. 2 Ma. Archaeoziphius microglenoideus is therefore the oldest reported beaked whale known by cranial material...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundMost of the {{complications}} of the Latarjet procedure {{are related to the}} bone block positioning and use of screws. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate if an arthroscopic Latarjet guiding system improves accuracy of bone block positioning and if suture button fixation could be an alternative to screw fixation in allowing bone block healing and avoiding complications. Materials and methodsSeventy-six patients (mean age, 27  years) underwent an arthroscopic Latarjet procedure with a guided surgical approach and suture button fixation. Bone graft union and positioning accuracy were assessed by postoperative computed tomography imaging. Clinical examinations were performed at each visit. ResultsAt a mean of 14  months (range, 6 - 24  months) postoperatively, 75 of 76 patients had a stable shoulder. No neurologic complications were observed; no patients have required further surgery. The coracoid graft was positioned strictly tangential to the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> in 96 % of the cases and below the equator in 93 %. The coracoid graft healed in 69 patients (91 %). ConclusionsA guided surgical approach optimizes graft positioning accuracy. Suture button fixation can be an alternative to screw fixation, obtaining an excellent rate of bone union. Neurologic and hardware complications, classically reported with screw fixation, have not been observed with this guided technique and novel fixation method...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of the shape of the prosthetic humeral head on shoulder biomechanics and then to evaluate the benefits of an anatomical reconstruction of the humeral head after shoulder arthroplasty. DESIGN: A 3 D numerical model of a healthy shoulder was reconstructed. The model included the proximal humerus, the scapula and, for stability purposes, the subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus rotator cuff muscles. BACKGROUND: Shoulder prostheses used nowadays, called third generation, allow for a better adaptation of the implant to the anatomy of the proximal humerus than previously used implants. However, no biomechanical study has shown the benefits of this anatomical reconstruction of the humeral head. METHODS: The model was used to compare the biomechanics of a shoulder without implant with the biomechanics of the same shoulder after humeral hemiarthroplasty. Two humeral components were tested: a second-generation prosthesis and an implant with an anatomically reconstructed humeral head. RESULTS: The anatomical reconstruction of the humeral head restored the physiological motions and limited eccentric loading of the glenoid. Conversely, the second-generation implant produced contact forces in the superior extremity of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> leading to bone stresses up to 8 times higher than for the intact shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provided insights into the mechanical effects of different reconstructions of the humeral head and highlighted the advantages of anatomical reconstructions of the humeral head during shoulder arthroplasty...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{directly}} measure the glenoid depth and clarify {{its relationship with the}} stability ratio. We used 9 fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders (mean age : 66 years, 5 males and 4 females). Naked glenohumeral joint was investigated. The shoulder was fixed to the custom designed measurement device with the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> horizontal to the floor and the humerus with 45 ° abduction and 35 ° external rotation. The stability ratio was 27. 1 ± 6. 5 % (mean ± standard deviation) at 90 ° in the anterior, 26. 2 ± 7. 9 % at 280 ° in the posterior (the minimum), 48. 3 ± 10. 4 at 10 ° in the superior, and 52. 9 ± 12. 5 % at 180 ° in the inferior (the maximum) direction. The mean glenoid depth was 1. 4 ± 0. 3 mm at 90 ° and 270 °, and 3. 4 ± 0. 9 and 3. 3 ± 0. 9 mm at 0 ° and 180 °, respectively, showing that both the stability ratio and glenoid depth were minimal in the anterior 3 o’clock direction. The stability ratio increased as the glenoid depth increased, and the correlation coefficient was 0. 92 (p= 0. 01), showing a markedly strong positive correlation. The glenohumeral joint is most unstable in the anterior direction in terms of the bony stability...|$|E
40|$|Background: Multiple bone-grafting {{procedures}} {{have been described}} for patients with glenoid bone loss and shoulder instability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the alterations in glenohumeral contact pressure associated with the placement and orientation of Latarjet or iliac crest bone graft augmentation and to compare the amount of glenoid bone reconstruction with two coracoid face orientations. Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen cadaver shoulders were tested in static positions of humeral abduction (30, 60, and 60 with 90 of external rotation) with a 440 -N compressive load. Glenohumeral contact pressure and area were determined sequentially for (1) the intact glenoid; (2) a glenoid with an anterior bone defect involving 15 % or 30 % of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>surface</b> area; (3) a 30 % glenoid defect treated with a Latarjet or iliac crest bone graft placed 2 mm proud, placed flush, or recessed 2 mm in relation to the level of the glenoid; and (4) a Latarjet bone block placed flush and oriented with either the lateral (Latarjet-LAT) or the inferior (Latarjet-INF) surface of the coracoid as the glenoid face. The amount of glenoid bone reconstructed was compared between the Latarjet-LAT and Latarjet-INF conditions. Results: Bone grafts in the flush position restored the mean peak contact pressure to 116 % of normal when the iliac crest bone graft was used (p < 0. 03 compared with the pressure with the 30 % defect), 120 % when the Latarjet-INF bon...|$|E
