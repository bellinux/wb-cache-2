500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E

60|$|As a {{means of}} getting over the {{difficulty}} of procuring really representative faces, I contrived the method of composite portraiture, which has been explained of late on many occasions, and of which a full account will be found in Appendix A. The principle on which the composites are made will best be understood by a description of my earlier and now discarded method; it was this--(1) I collected photographic portraits of different persons, {{all of whom had}} been photographed in the same aspect (say full face), and under the same conditions of light and shade (say with the light coming from the right side). (2) I reduced their portraits photographically to the same size, being guided as to scale by the distance between any two convenient points of reference in the features; for example, by the vertical distance between two parallel lines, one of which passed through the middle of the pupils of the eyes and the other between the lips. (3) I superimposed the portraits like the successive leaves of a book, so that the features of each portrait lay as exactly as the case admitted, in front of those of the one behind it, eye in front of eye and mouth in front of mouth. This I did by holding them successively to the light and adjusting them, then by fastening each to the preceding one with a strip of gummed paper along one of the edges. Thus I obtained a book, each page of which contained a separate portrait, and all the portraits lay exactly in front of one another. (4) I fastened the book against the wall {{in such a way that}} I could turn over the pages in succession, leaving in turn each portrait flat and fully exposed. (5) <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> my camera on the book fixed it firmly, and put a sensitive plate inside it. (6) I began photographing, taking one page after the other in succession without moving the camera, but putting on the cap whilst I was turning over the pages, so that an image of each of the portraits in succession was thrown on the same part of the sensitised plate.|$|E
