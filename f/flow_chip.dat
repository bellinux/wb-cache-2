40|$|AbstractHPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> is a newly {{developed}} test for identifying 18 high-risk and 18 low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. It {{is based on}} direct PCR from crude-cell extracts, automatic flow-through hybridization, and colorimetric detection. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> in the analysis of 947 samples from routine cervical screening or the follow-up of abnormal Pap smears. The specimens were dry swab samples, liquid-based cytology samples, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The genotype distribution was in agreement with known epidemiological data for the Spanish population. Three different subgroups of the samples were also tested by Linear Array (LA) HPV Genotyping Test (n= 108), CLART HPV 2 (n= 82), or Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) HPV DNA Test (n= 101). HPV positivity was 73. 6 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 67 % by LA, 65. 9 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 59. 8 % by CLART, and 62. 4 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 42. 6 % by HC 2. HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> showed a positive agreement of 88. 6 % with LA (k= 0. 798), 87. 3 % with CLART (k= 0. 818), and 68. 2 % with HC 2 (k= 0. 618). In conclusion, HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> results were comparable with those of the other methods tested. Although further investigation is needed to compare the performance of this new test with a gold-standard reference method, these preliminary findings evidence the potential value of HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> in HPV vaccinology and epidemiology studies...|$|E

This study examined the performance of HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (n = 99). Each sample was analyzed both by Direct PCR, using crude cell extracts without DNA purification, and by conventional PCR, using purified DNA. Pair-wise analysis of the results demonstrated strong concordance between the results obtained with the two protocols, although a slightly higher rate of multiple infections was detected by conventional PCR. In summary, HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> achieves effective HPV detection from FFPE samples with both Direct PCR and Conventional PCR protocols...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{semester}} project was to implement a USB interface for Alan Stocker’s neuromorphic Optical <b>Flow</b> <b>Chip</b> (Motion 18). For this, a PCB with the necessary components was designed. Then, firmware for the onboard microcontroller was written. Finally, the setup was tested with custom host-side visualization software and optimized for framerate. Key components used on the PCB were a USB microcontroller from Silicon Labs, a 16 channel DAC from Analog Devices and two level shifters from Fairchild. These were used to set the bias voltages for the Optical <b>Flow</b> <b>Chip,</b> to clock it, to read out its data and to transmit the data via USB to the host. The device is powered entirely by the USB hub. As the Optical <b>Flow</b> <b>Chip</b> is noise-sensitive, steps were taken to minimize the noise on the PCB. The USB supply voltage was filtered using a ferrite bead and a 10 µF tantalum capacitor. For the routing, analog and digital ground separation and the high-noise USB data channels were taken into account. For the firmware, high transmission rate was the goal. Different steps to optimize speed were taken: USB transmission uses double buffering; the AD conversion is done in parallel to other tasks when possible; the transmitted 10 -bit values are packet into a bit stream to avoid waste of bandwidth; the loop control is done with efficiency as objective. i iiContent...|$|E

40|$|Trent {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} tribological conditions of seizure at the tool–chip interface, when the normal pressure exceeds the flow stress of asperities so that the asperities are squeezed to make atomic contact. In consequence, chemical dissolution of the tool into the chip occurs by a diffusion mechanism, causing chemical wear. Oxley incorporated the concept of seizure in his quantitative model for <b>flow</b> <b>chip</b> morphology. Oxley {{introduced the}} concept of equilibrium shear angle in his quantitative model for <b>flow</b> <b>chip</b> morphology, which incorporates the work of shear in the secondary shear zone instead of friction, once atomic contact is established, but Oxley’s model ignored potential interaction from metallurgical softening events in the secondary shear zone, which led to prediction of unrealistically high temperature at high cutting speeds. In fact, metallurgical softening events do occur particularly at high cutting speeds, causing shear localisation, which leads to significant deviation from Oxley’s model predictions. In this paper, Oxley’s model will be extended to capture the interaction of shear localisation in the secondary shear zone on the mechanics of metal cutting. Dynamic recrystallisation, phase transformation of the matrix and geometric softening owing to second phase particles are identified as important microstructural softening events causing shear localisation, which could intervene before the equilibrium shear angle is reached. The occurrence of shear localisation is shown to alter the mechanics of metal cutting, chip morphology and the tool wear mechanism.

40|$|Efficient {{solar energy}} storage {{is a key}} {{challenge}} in striving toward a sustainable future. For this reason, molecules capable of solar energy storage and release through valence isomerization, for so-called molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST), have been investigated. Energy storage by photo-conversion of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photothermal couple has been evaluated. The robust nature of this system is determined through multiple energy storage and release cycles at elevated temperatures in three different solvents. In a nonpolar solvent such as toluene, the DHA/VHF system can be cycled more than 70 times with less than 0. 01 % degradation per cycle. Moreover, the [Cu(CH(3) CN 4] P- 6 -catalyzed conversion of VHF into DHA was demonstrated in a flow reactor. The performance of the DHA/VHF couple was also evaluated in prototype photoconversion devices, both in the laboratory by using a <b>flow</b> <b>chip</b> under simulated sunlight and under outdoor conditions by using a parabolic mirror. Device experiments demonstrated a solar energy storage efficiency of up to 0. 13 % in the chip device and up to 0. 02 % in the parabolic collector.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology has consisted of proving a series of parameters combinations: f, feed rate, Vc, cutting speeds are explored in a range from 50 to 250 m/min, and is analyzing the different types of chips and the evolution cutting forces appeared during each one them, and determined the analytical model of plastic deformation ratio. Findings: Tests achieved have shown three main types of chips: Continuous chip at 50 m/min, <b>Flow</b> <b>chip</b> for speeds ranging around 100 m/min, and Shear localized chip starting from the transition speed of 125 m/min and above. The modification of the mechanism of chip formation is associated with the appearance of shearing instability. Chip segmentation by shear localisation is an important process which is observed within a certain range of cutting speeds. This phenomenon might be desirable in reducing the level of the cutting forces by improving chip’s evacuation. Research limitations/implications: A possible future work would be the development of a general the phenomenal of the thermo mechanical of the cutting high speed machining. The behavior is of the thermo – visco – plastic studies are planed in the future.

40|$|Keeping up {{the product}} {{competitiveness}} continually requires solving {{the problems of}} reducing time for product creation and material costs for its production and ensuring the maximum conformity of the product quality with the individual requirements of a particular consumer. It is especially difficult to implement these tasks in product manufacturing from the hard-to-machine steels and alloys with extremely low production rate in machining (often 10 - 20 times lower than when cutting the ordinary structural steels). Currently, one of the promising {{ways to improve the}} cutting process of hard-to-machine materials and quality of parts made from these materials is development and application of combined processing methods, which use additional energy sources to act on the machined material in the cutting zone. A BMSTU-developed cutting method with leading plastic deformation (LPD), which acts to raise the production rate, gain the cutting tool-life, reduce the surface roughness, improve the accuracy of processing and the performance characteristics of products, ensure the reliable <b>flow</b> <b>chip</b> control, and improve the labor conditions, belongs to such sort of methods. One of the most important indicators of processing quality that has a great impact on the operation and cost characteristics of the product and on the machining rate as well is the accuracy of processing. In cutting, the processing errors largely arise from the elastic deformations of a technological system when the cutting force, and, in particular, the radial component of the cutting force, acts on it. The deforming devices, used in cutting with LPD, being located as a rule, on the diametrically opposite side with respect to the cutting zone, act on the technological system as vibration dampers. In addition, as studies have shown, the choice of a rational direction for applying LPD load helps to compensate partially or completely the cutting force radial component effect on the technological system, thereby raising the accuracy of processing through reducing a value of the elastic deformations of a work-piece in the cutting zone. The paper presents the comparative test results of the work-piece shape accuracy in cutting with LPD and in conventional cutting in two respects: profile deviation of the longitudinal section of the cylindrical surface and circularity deviation. The studies were carried out using a special BMSTU-designed installation, which allows us to regulate direction of the angle of LPD force action, and, consequently, the load values in direction perpendicular to the surface to be machined. The experiments were carried out on soft samples, made from the low rigid hard-to-machine materials, belonging to different groups of machining property. It is found that when cutting with LPD there is a significant reduction of shape errors. For the processing conditions, assumed in the experiments, as compared to the ordinary cutting a deviation of the profile of the longitudinal section and a circularity deviation were decreased by 2. 4 - 3. 3 times and 1. 2 - 1. 6 times, respectively. </p...|$|E

Important process parameters such as shear angle, friction angle, shear stress, and <b>chip</b> <b>flow</b> angle are analyzed. Transformation {{of the data}} from the orthogonal cutting test results to oblique cutting process is applied, and the results are compared with actual oblique cutting tests. Effects of hone radius on cutting forces and flank contact length are also investigated. It is observed that the shear angle, friction angle, and shear stress in oblique cutting have the same trend with the ones obtained from the orthogonal cutting tests. The transformed oblique force coefficients from orthogonal tests have about 10 % discrepancy in the feed and tangential directions. For the <b>chip</b> <b>flow</b> angle, the predictions based on kinematic and force balance results yield better results than Stabler's <b>chip</b> <b>flow</b> law. Finally, it is shown that the method of oblique transformation applied on the orthogonal cutting data yields more accurate results using the predicted <b>chip</b> <b>flow</b> angles compared to the ones obtained by the Stabler's rule...|$|R
40|$|A new graphic {{method is}} proposed, {{in which the}} hobbing state in the {{unfinished}} tooth space can be easily illustrated through simple calculations and with only one tooth profile template. This method is useful {{not only in the}} estimation of the cutting thickness, length and zone in various hobbings but also in the forecast of the <b>chip</b> <b>flowing</b> on the rake face. The tooth wear can be also related analytically with the cutting amount and the <b>chip</b> <b>flowing.</b> Additionally, several tooth profiles developed for the anti-wear purpose are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} laminar {{natural convection}} <b>flow</b> with three <b>chips</b> at various positions was analyzed by employing the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) code PHOENICS. The SIMPLEST algorithm with the Hybrid Scheme was used to simulate these <b>flows.</b> Three <b>chips,</b> arranged in five different positions with isothermal and insulated walls, were solved. The temperature distribution of our computational results {{was similar to the}} experimental data trend and very close to the numerical results achieved by Beak et al. The calculating results show that different chip position arrangements strongly influence the chip average temperature. The highest temperature occurred with the vertical chip arrangements. The findings herein establish a fundamental numerical study of three-dimensional heat transfer using three chips and a basis for further analysis of the associated heat transfer for more complicated chip position arrangements...|$|R

40|$|When {{processing}} ductile metals {{with high}} cutting speed, {{there is a}} need to take additional measures for a comfortable and safe formation and removal of chips. In the conditions of large-scale manufacture, it is recommended to produce <b>flow</b> <b>chips</b> in the form of short fragments, while in the conditions of small-lot and single-piece manufacture, it is reasonable to wrap the chips spirally with a rather small turn radius. Such way of chips formation reduces the time of its removal from the working area as well as facilitates its transportation and processing. In order to solve the problem of chip wrapping and breakage, almost all modern manufacturers of tools with replaceable many-sided plates (RMSP) followed the way of complication of tool faces and determination of the areas of effective chip breaking. On the one hand, the suggested solution turns out to be effective; however, as showed the analysis of recommended cutting modes for complex forms of RMSP made by leading manufacturers, they all correspond to the definite cross section of the cut-layer S/t= 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} cutting models which describe the chip formation process. However, {{they are based}} on a number of simplifying assumptions. In order to verify these assumptions and to get {{a better understanding of the}} cutting process, the different stress states in the chip formation zone were determined by means of diffraction experiments with monochromatic high-energy synchrotron X-radiation during orthogonal, quasistatic cutting of the material C 45 E. The results from the experiments are compared with simulated stresses. The experimental data indicate that the assumption of a free <b>chip</b> <b>flow</b> according to the shear angle model of Opitz and Hucks is not valid. The model was therefore extended considering the normal stresses in direction of the <b>chip</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

Pressure and friction acting on the cutter- chip interface decrease with the increase of feed rate. <b>Chip</b> <b>flow</b> angle increases with the increase of feed rate.
