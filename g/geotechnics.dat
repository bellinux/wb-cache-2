At the site of the accident, the speed limit was lowered to 15km/h, with the speed limit on either side of that stretch of track being 30km/h. In modern times, the speed limit has been set at a flat 100km/h.|$|E

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of slopes {{to failure}} during earthquakes is calculated, {{in terms of}} critical horizontal acceleration, on a subregional scale for {{the upper part of}} the Serchio River basin (Tuscany, Italy). According to the working scale (1 : 10 000) and to the availability and accuracy of the input data, the infinite slope analysis was judged to be the most appropriate method, but particular attention was devoted to the error evaluation due to spatial variability of the <b>geotechnic,</b> geometric, and hydrologic parameters. A geologic, geomorphologic and hydrologic survey of the area was therefore performed, and the <b>geotechnic</b> parameters were collected at local administrations. All the data were stored in a GIS, used as a tool to build the spatial and attribute data base and to prepare the input data layers for the stability analysis. In order to assess the variability of <b>geotechnic</b> parameters, a statistical analysis was performed to assign the best-fitting probability distribution to cohesion, angle of internal friction and unit weight of the soil. As hydrogeologic data were not available for the area, only surface hydrology information could be used; a map of probability of spring occurrences was derived by a bayesian method, the Weight of Evidence Modelling, and was used as groundwater indicator. A Monte Carlo procedure and a first-order second-moment method were applied and compared as error estimators in assessing the slope susceptibility to failure. The differences between the two methods are discussed, and two maps showing, respectively, the critical horizontal acceleration and the probability of failure associated with each slope are presented, together with the curve plotting the reliability index against the probability of failure...|$|R

The pump tube of a two-stage light-gas gun was used to attain impact velocities of approximately 2 km/sec. The results of the experiments indicate that the energy of formation of any large impact crater depends upon the impact velocity.

40|$|International audienceFull {{waveform}} inversion (FWI) is {{an appealing}} seismic data-fitting procedure for the derivation of high-resolution quantitative {{models of the}} subsurface at various scales. Full modelling and inversion of visco-elastic waves from multiple seismic sources allow for the recovering of different physical parameters, although they remain computationally challenging tasks. An efficient massively parallel, frequency-domain FWI algorithm is implemented here on large-scale distributed-memory platforms for imaging two-dimensional visco-elastic media. The resolution of the elastodynamic equations, as the forward problem of the inversion, is performed in the frequency domain on unstructured triangular meshes, using a low-order finite element discontinuous Galerkin method. The linear system resulting from discretization of the forward problem is solved with a parallel direct solver. The inverse problem, which {{is presented as a}} non-linear local optimization problem, is solved in parallel with a quasi-Newton method, and this allows for reliable estimation of multiple classes of visco-elastic parameters. Two levels of parallelism are implemented in the algorithm, based on message passing interfaces and multi-threading, for optimal use of computational time and the core-memory resources available on modern distributed-memory multi-core computational platforms. The algorithm allows for imaging of realistic targets at various scales, ranging from near-surface <b>geotechnic</b> applications to crustal-scale exploration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{event of}} {{earthquake}} may induce {{the occurrence of}} liquefaction hazard. Liquefaction could cause damage to buildings and infrastructure due to the sudden increase of pore pressure at the loose uncompacted layers causing the loss of support or bearing capacity. The Yogyakarta earthquake on May 27, 2006 of magnitude 6. 2 had resulted in liquefaction phenomenon to occur in several affected areas. During this earthquake liquefaction occurrences were observed near the Opak Fault area.

Results of liquefaction analysis indicated that the thickness of potentially liquefied soil layer vari es between 0. 2 - 5. 2 m and total settlement induced by the liquefaction is varied from 1. 0 - 10. 8 cm concentrated at the middle part of Opak Fault.

40|$|Landslides {{have large}} {{negative}} economic and societal impacts, including {{loss of life}} and damage to infrastructure. Slope stability assessment is a vital tool for landslide risk management, but high levels of uncertainty often challenge its usefulness. Uncertainties {{are associated with the}} numerical model used to assess slope stability and its parameters, with the data characterizing the geometric, <b>geotechnic</b> and hydrologic properties of the slope, and with hazard triggers (e. g. rainfall). Uncertainties associated with many of these factors are also likely to be exacerbated further by future climatic and socio-economic changes, such as increased urbanization and resultant land use change. In this study, we illustrate how numerical models can be used to explore the uncertain factors that influence potential future landslide hazard using a bottom-up strategy. Specifically, we link the Combined Hydrology And Stability Model (CHASM) with sensitivity analysis and Classification And Regression Trees (CART) to identify critical thresholds in slope properties and climatic (rainfall) drivers that lead to slope failure. We apply our approach to a slope in the Caribbean, an area that is naturally susceptible to landslides due to a combination of high rainfall rates, steep slopes, and highly weathered residual soils. For this particular slope, we find that uncertainties regarding some slope properties (namely thickness and effective cohesion of topsoil) are as important as the uncertainties related to future rainfall conditions. Furthermore, we show that 89  % of the expected behaviour of the studied slope can be characterized based on only two variables – the ratio of topsoil thickness to cohesion and the ratio of rainfall intensity to duration...|$|R
