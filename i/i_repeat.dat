25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, <b>I</b> <b>repeat,</b> doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E

40|$|Thrombospondin (TSP) 1 is a trimeric {{extracellular}} matrix protein that is {{held together by}} two cysteine residues. It {{is one of five}} TSP proteins that have been described to date with almost a universal heparin binding capability (TSP 5 being the exception). The existence of two conformationally distinct structures in the TSP family (trimers and pentamers) prompted us to investigate the contribution of TSP 1 trimeric structure to its inhibitory role in angiogenesis. We expressed full-length recombinant human TSP 1, its type <b>I</b> <b>repeats,</b> and murine TSP 3 in a human embryonic kidney cell line and evaluated their effect on human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) proliferation and sprouting into tube-like structures in vitro. Additionally, two chimaeric molecules were constructed so that the type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP 1 were expressed as either dimers (TSP 1 -Ig chimaera) or pentamers (TSP 1 -TSP 3 chimaera). Dimeric and pentameric type I constructs are novel structures. We found that, similarly to full-length TSP 1, intact trimeric type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> were inhibitory to HMVEC angiogenesis in vitro. However, dimeric and pentameric type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP 1 only partially inhibited HMVEC proliferation and sprouting in vitro. TSP 3, which is lacking type <b>I</b> <b>repeats,</b> had no inhibitory activity, confirming that type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> elicit the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP 1...|$|R

Oh yeah; the kids will {{probably}} like it, too." [...] Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote [...] "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the importance of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of SpongeBob SquarePants. In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only [...] "recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "SpongeBob may, and <b>I</b> <b>repeat,</b> 'may,' be starting to level off." [...] He particularly criticized the later entries as [...] "indication of that potential trend." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here. As this is {{absolute}} oppression, if I were a bookseller in this town, I would use all the safe means to reprint London books, and run them to any town in England, that I could, because whoever offends not the laws of God, or the country he lives in, commits no sin.... But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because <b>I</b> <b>repeat,</b> it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reception {{by trade}} publications. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "The tender end, mother, is good; it's well acted. What I said about The Doctor's Carriage <b>I</b> <b>repeat.</b> This theme is far-fetched; the convict stripes unnecessary. Whoever {{was at the}} helm in this picture {{was just a little}} bit mixed - as to the course." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review was more neutral and stated the film was rather engaging and it will keep the audiences interest. The reviewer did not find either specific praise or fault in the actual production itself. The New York Dramatic Mirror was the most detailed in its review. The reviewer states, [...] "There are very strong situations in this picture story, based on the efforts of a young man and his sweetheart to prevent the young man's mother from knowing that he has been sent to prison. ... In a series of melodramatic scenes that are not as convincing as they might be, we see the son elude the penitentiary officers, and later he returns openly to his home with a newspaper in which is printed the confession of the criminal who had committed the offense of which the son had been convicted. Some of the scenes were handled too abruptly for the best results, but otherwise the acting appears satisfactory." [...] Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E

2500|$|Some of them {{claim that}} {{the changes in the}} Roman Rite of Mass were made {{in order to make it}} {{acceptable}} to non-Catholics. French philosopher Jean Guitton said that Pope Paul VI's intention was to assimilate the Catholic liturgy to the Protestant: [...] "The intention of Paul VI with regard to what is commonly called the Mass, was to reform the Catholic liturgy in such a way that it should almost coincide with the Protestant liturgy – but what is curious is that Paul VI did that to get as close as possible to the Protestant Lord's Supper, ... there was with Paul VI an ecumenical intention to remove, or at least to correct, or to relax, what was too Catholic, in the traditional sense, in the Mass and, <b>I</b> <b>repeat,</b> to get the Catholic Mass closer to the Calvinist Mass." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the closure}} of his companies, Manners {{continued}} to campaign for a national opera company.

[...] In 1926 he wrote a long article on [...] "The Financial Problem of National Opera. By the People for the People", explaining his rationale. He disapproved of public subsidy, insisting that opera could be self-supporting and even profitable. [...] Although later attempts to follow his precepts, such as those of Raymond Gubbay at the Savoy Theatre in 2004, have failed, his dream of a national opera company presenting operas in English has been realised.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "joke" [...] {{was evidently}} {{already in the}} {{mainstream}} by the very early 1970s; in the October 1972 edition of MAD magazine (issue no. 154), an article entitled [...] "When Watching Television, You Can be Sure of Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: [...] "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! <b>I</b> <b>repeat,</b> they are not married! They are not even going steady!" [...] Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor and as a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again. Three years later, Nabors would begin a long-term (and, until 2013, secret) relationship with Stan Cadwallader, a retired firefighter from Honolulu and the man he would eventually marry once same-sex marriage was legalized.|$|E
