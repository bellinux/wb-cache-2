40|$|Pomace {{olive oil}} is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols,</b> which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were tetracosanol, hexacosanol and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> from pomace olive oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols,</b> reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of pomace olive oil.

50|$|Most <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> {{in nature}} are found as waxes which are esters with fatty acids and <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols.</b> They are {{produced}} by bacteria, plants and animals for purposes of buoyancy, as source of metabolic water and energy, biosonar lenses (marine mammals) and for thermal insulation {{in the form of}} waxes (in plants and insects). <b>Fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were unavailable until the early 1900s. They were originally obtained by reduction of wax esters with sodium by the Bouveault-Blanc reduction process. In the 1930s catalytic hydrogenation was commercialized, which allowed the conversion of fatty acid esters, typically tallow, to the alcohols. In the 1940s and 1950s, petrochemicals became an important source of chemicals, and Karl Ziegler had discovered the polymerization of ethylene.
