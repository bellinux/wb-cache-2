30|$|The 5.6  mm year− 1 DBH growth {{established}} {{from trees}} within the <b>growth</b> <b>plot</b> {{shows that the}} DK trees are growing more rapidly than most young naturally occurring stands. Pardy et al. ([1992]) suggested that, in the early ‘pole’ stages of growth, {{it is not uncommon}} for 5  mm annual diameter increases in naturally occurring stands, which is in good agreement with the figure of 4.3  mm year− 1 reported by Burns and Smale ([1990]) from ~ 1 to 200 -year-old trees, generally still in ‘ricker’ form, on the Coromandel Peninsula. Steward and Kimberley ([2002]) recorded somewhat slower growth (1.3 – 3.4  mm year− 1) in another natural stand of trees 120 – 218 years old. Considering climate alone, the higher average growth-rate of DK trees compared to naturally occurring stands further north is worthy of comment. However, the site selection and silvicultural attention afforded plantation trees introduce a number of variables beyond climate. It is not unusual for plantations of many species, even beyond their naturally occurring range, to exceed natural growth rates (Pardy et al. [1992]). A large part of the success of kauri at DK is likely due to site selection: growth trials have shown that kauri grow best amongst gaps within taller surrounding vegetation (I Barton, personal communication). It may be that the surrounding, established plantation of indigenous species at DK generated a favourable microclimate for kauri growth. Surrounding forest cover may help explain why Bergin and Steward ([2004]) suggested that there is no evidence of frost damage to DK trees, despite the fact that the area would regularly receive frosts lower than − 4 to − 6 °C, which Barton ([1982], [1985]) found caused lasting damage or death of kauri seedlings. Frost damage may be a primary cause of multiple leaders in kauri, which are very rare on naturally established trees in forest or scrub-land (I Barton personal communication). There are multiple trees at DK with double-leaders which could suggest some, non-fatal frost damage to seedlings rather than no frost damage as reported by Bergin and Steward ([2004]).|$|E
40|$|Charybdis feriata {{supports}} trawl fishery of Karnataka {{coast and}} the entire catch is landed by multiday trawlers operating beyond 30 m depth zone. The highest landing was observed during 2003 (142 t). Fishing season for the species extend generally from September to June but peak fishing season of the species was during December-June. Size range observed in the fishery was 46 to 170 mm in males and 26 to 155 mm in females. Mean size ranged from 66 mm to 80 mm. Test of homogeneity of the sex ratio (χ 2 test) for the years, 2007 - 2009 showed that proportion conform to 1 : 1 ratio. Studies conducted on reproductive stages of the species show that the species is a continuous breeder with two peak breeding season, one during October–November and another during May-June. Size at maturity (50 %) of females was estimated at 70 mm carapace width and age at 50 % maturity was about 7 months. Carapace width-weight studies showed that males were heavier than females of similar size. By von Bertalanffy’s <b>growth</b> <b>plot,</b> {{it was estimated that}} males and females reach 101 mm, 99 mm (CW) respectively at the end of first year and reach 142 mm and 137 mm respectively in two years. Stock assessment studies of the species was conducted using sex pooled data for the period 2007 - 2009 so as to formulate management suggestions. The Z, M and F values estimated for the species were 6. 04, 1. 76 and 4. 28 respectively. The exploitation ratio (E) was 0. 71. MSY was estimated as 131 t against the present annual average yield of 124 t. From ‘Thompson and Bell yield prediction analysis ’ it is seen that any additional 10 % effort from the present level will yield only less than 10 % additional catch, indicating that increasing the effort for better catch of the resource will not be economical and it is suggested that restricting the catch to MSY level (131 t) will be the suitable management option for the sustainability of C. feriata fishery from the coast...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Crow/AMSAA {{reliability}} <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> use failure {{information from}} maintenance systems {{to provide a}} visual tool, with straight-line graphs, for predicting the next failure in systems where humans can influence the results. C/A plots work well with single failure or mixed failure modes. The simple log-log plots have easily calculated statistics to show if failures are increasing, decreasing, or exhibiting no-change in failure rates. The straight-line plots are helpful for forecasting future failures—the “fearless forecast ” of future events catches the interest {{of people who can}} change the system to prevent the forecasted events. When implementing system improvements calculate and track the savings in failures between the old and new methods to convert maintenance situations into time and money for easy selection of alternatives.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Nicole K. Jensen, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} Forestry, {{presented}} on April 3, 2012, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: TREE-RING CHEMISTRY AND GROWTH RESPONSE TO EXPERIMENTAL WATERSHED ACIDIFICATION MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Eric Holzmueller Forest ecosystems {{in the eastern}} United States are threatened by acid deposition rates that have increased dramatically since industrialization. We utilized two watersheds at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia to examine long-term effects of acidification on ecological processes. One watershed has been treated with ammonium sulfate (approximately twice the ambient deposition rate) since 1989 to simulate acid deposition while the other served as a control. Prior to treatment both watersheds were similar in age and species composition. Ten dominant overstory Prunus serotina and Liriodendron tulipifiera trees were selected and cored from each watershed to measure bolewood concentrations of elements essential for growth over time. In addition, changes in tree species basal area were analyzed utilizing 50 long-term <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> established in 1990. Results of this experiment show lower calcium and magnesium concentration and increased acidic cation concentration in the treated watershed for both species indicating a negative treatment effect. These results were {{similar to that of}} a previous study conducted at the Fernow with periods of significant differences in cation concentrations between the treated and control watershed. Growth response, measured through relative growth rates of cored trees and changes in basal area from <b>growth</b> <b>plots,</b> was not as conclusive, but it did appear that treatment may be having a negative affect for both species during the last measurement of the <b>growth</b> <b>plots.</b> These results indicate a need for further research to understand the impact of long-term acidification so that sustainable forest management practices in areas affected by acid deposition may be developed...|$|R
30|$|Data were {{obtained}} from permanent sample plots (PSP) (Ellis and Hayes [1991]) established {{in the interior of}} the stands. In larger stands more than one PSP was established. Small stands typically had adjoining forest comprised of species of equal stature and similar growth rate to kauri, therefore all stems were used, including those that would otherwise be defined as edge-trees (Cancino [2005]). In 1986, Pardy et al. ([1992]) established <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> to obtain data on the height and diameter growth of planted kauri. During the 1986 assessments, all measured trees were tagged. In later measurements, PSPs were overlaid to include previous <b>growth</b> <b>plots.</b> For each PSP, data were gathered on diameter of all stems at 1.4 m breast height; total tree height of selected stems; planting pattern; current and initial stand density; current stand age; survival/mortality; site characteristics (elevation, annual sunshine hours, rainfall and daily mean temperature). Not all kauri were measured for height, so unmeasured heights were estimated by fitting non-linear regression curves to the height and diameter data for each stand, at each measurement period. Predicted heights were calculated for each stand at each measurement period and estimated heights were entered onto the database.|$|R

Although, on average, the brain and cognition improve with abstinence or markedly reduced substance use, better understanding of the heterogeneity in the time-course and extent of cognitive recovery at the individual level is useful to promote bench-to-bedside translation and inform clinical decision making. This study integrated a variable-centered and a person-centered approach to characterize diversity in cognitive recovery in 197 patients in treatment for a substance use disorder. We assessed executive function, verbal ability, memory, and complex information processing speed at treatment entry, and then 6, 26, and 52 weeks later. Structural equation modeling was used to define underlying ability constructs and determine the mean level of cognitive changes in the sample while minimizing measurement error and practice effects on specific tests. Individual-level empirical <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> of latent factor scores were used to explore prototypical trajectories of cognitive change. At the level of the mean, small to medium effect size gains in cognitive abilities were observed over one year.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A branch {{mortality}} {{dating technique}} and whorl sampling strategy were implemented to model five-year crown recession from data collected on temporary plots. Twenty-eight Douglas-fir from two levels-of-growing- stock studies in Oregon and Washington were first dissected {{to validate the}} proposed dating technique and assess alternative sampling strategies. Branch mortalities in 10 - 15 whorls below crown base were dated by locating discontinuities between branch and bole growth rings in stem cross-sections. Along with height measurements to the sample whorls, this technique allowed reconstruction of past crown base positions. Backdated heights to crown base corresponded closely with 15 -year repeat crown measurements taken on the same trees. Seven sampling strategies (sampling scheme and estimator) were assessed {{for their ability to}} estimate past five-year crown recession by sampling only two to four whorls per tree. Simple linear regressions of estimated on actual recession for various five-year intervals suggested that a two-whorl sampling scheme with an appropriate estimator would perform adequately on temporary <b>growth</b> <b>plots.</b> This sampling strategy was applied to 357 Douglas-fir from temporary <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> in southwestern Oregon. Numerous nonlinear and logarithmic models were developed to predict five-year crown recession from other tree, stand, and site variables. Residual analyses and indices of fit demonstrated that a multiplicative model with lognormal errors was the most appropriate model form. Sapwood taper above breast height was modeled with a quadratic-quadratic segmented polynomial. This taper function allowed extrapolation or interpolation of sapwood area measurements near crown base to sapwood area at crown base. Transformation of gross crown dimensions into expressions of conic surface area yielded accurate predictions of sapwood area at crown base. These expressions were therefore inferred to reflect equally well the total leaf area of individual Douglas-fir trees in southwestern Oregon. Modeling at the resolution of gross crown dimensions therefore possesses both the physiological appeal of providing an accurate index of the tree's relative photosynthetic capacity and the conceptual appeal of portraying competition for light and aerial growing space...|$|R

In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of stress ratio and WC grain size, the characteristics of fatigue crack growth were investigated in WC-Co cemented carbides with two different grain sizes of 3 and 6 µm. Fatigue crack growth tests were carried out {{over a wide range}} of fatigue crack growth rates covering the threshold stress intensity factor range ∆Kth. It was found that crack growth rate da/dN against stress intensity factor range ∆K depended on stress ratio R. The crack <b>growth</b> rate <b>plotted</b> in terms of effective stress intensity factor range ∆Keff still exhibited the effect of microstructure...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} new methods {{it has been}} {{possible}} to measure the overall community metabolism {{as well as the}} standing state community in Silver Springs. Photosynthetic rates have been determined by downstream gradient methods, transplantation <b>growth</b> <b>plots,</b> and bell jars diurnally and annually. Respiration rates have been estimated with bell jars. The downstream losses of particulate, and dissolved organic matter have been found to balance, the excess of photosynthesis over respiration. The community has thus been demonstrated to be in a constant temperature, steady state, somewhat comparable to a climax on land. Nitrate, phosphate, and major chemical constituents are essentially constant. There is an approximate constancy of standing crop of organisms although the production rates in summer are three times those in the winter. Some evidence suggests that there, are photoperiodic changes in reproduction rates in spite of constant temperature. Rates of protein syntehsis estimated from nitrate uptake downstream agree (1) with photosynthetic quotients obtained from carbon dioxide and oxygen uptake downstream and (2) with the nitrogen content of the community. The overall annual production of 50, 000 lbs/acre is the greatest productivity we know of on land or sea. Such high figures seem reasonable with the flow of high nutrient, warm water and high light intensity over a dense periphyton community. Theoretical concepts of steady state thermodynamics have been applied to show that self maintaining open systems tend to adjust to high power and low efficiency output. The 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{province}} of Ontario holds approximately 70. 2 million hectares of forests: about 17 % of Canada’s and 2 % of the world’s forests. Approximately 21 million hectares are managed as commercial forests, {{with an annual}} harvest {{in the early part}} of the decade approaching 200 000 ha. Yield tables developed by Walter Plonski in the 1950 s provide the basis for most wood supply calculations and growth projections in Ontario. However, due to changes in legislation, policy, and the plan-ning process, they no longer fully meet the needs of resource managers. Furthermore, Plonski`s tables are not appropri-ate for the range of silvicultural options now practised in Ontario. In October 1999, the Canadian Ecology Centre-Forestry Research Partnership (CEC-FRP) was formed and initiated a series of projects that collectively aimed at characterizing, quantifying and ultimately increasing the economically available wood supply. Comprehensive, defensi-ble, and reliable forecasts of forest growth and yield were identified as key knowledge gaps. The CEC-FRP, with support from the broader science community and forest industry, initiated several new research activities to address these needs, the results of which are outlined briefly in this paper. We describe new stand level models (e. g., benchmark yield curves, FVSOntario, stand density management diagrams) that were developed using data collected from permanent sample <b>plots</b> and permanent <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> established and remeasured during the past 5 decades. Similarly, we discuss new height–diameter equations developed for 8 major commercial tree species that specifically account for stand density. A...|$|R

40|$|Over 50 % of the {{original}} extent of tropical forests has been cleared. Restoration of secondary forests is important for maintaining the ecosystem services that mature tropical forests provide. Density dependence (DD) {{is thought to be}} a major mechanism for shaping forest community structure and may cause reduced spatial aggregation among individuals of the same species, allowing for maintenance of diversity. While much research has focused on DD in mature tropical forests, few studies have examined how DD may influence community structure in secondary forests, many of which are also exposed to hunting. There are several important agents of negative and positive DD, including natural enemies and mutualists of trees. Mammals are important herbivores of seedlings. Hence, forest protection status is also likely to be a key factor influencing density-dependent seedling survival because it affects populations of mammals through trophic cascades. Here, we address the questions, (1) Is there an overall density dependent effect? (2) How the type, direction, and strength of DD differ between forests of different successional ages and protection status? We used neighborhood models fit to one-year survival of 8, 042 seedlings of 114 species in early successional to old <b>growth</b> <b>plots</b> with different protection status in northeastern Costa Rica. We found that, averaging across forests, there was a negative significant conspecific density dependent effect (CND). Despite this overall effect, there was also significant variation among forests of different successional age and protection status. CND strength increased with successional age in protected forest and decreased in unprotected forests. Adviser: Sabrina E. Russ...|$|R

Each virus was applied in separate treatments by two application methods; as an aqueous spray containing 0. 1 % Agral as a wetting agent, and as abran bait. The NPV was applied at arate of 4 X 1012 polyhedra/ha, and the GVat 4 X 1013 granules/ha. Soil and plants were sampled fQr larvae on three occasions following virus treatment: 24 h, 4 days and 11 days. The larvae were reared on diet in the laboratory, until death or pupation, to examine the rafe and level of viral infection. lnfection data showed 87. 5 % and 91 % NPV infection and 12. 5 % and 55 % GV infection in spray and bait treatments, respectively, in larvae sampled 24 h after treatment. In larvae sampled 4 days after treatment, the results were 78 % andl 00 % NPVinfection, and 13 % and 6 % GVinfectiqn. A totalofonly six larvae were retrieved on day 11.

40|$|In Pureora and Whirinaki Forest Parks 30 - 40 % {{of total}} {{merchantable}} timber volume was harvested in 1961 from two unreplicated 15 -ha blocks of podocarp/ tawa forest; a further block remained unlogged as a control. In 19 years after logging at Pureora, {{the actual number}} of merchantable trees lost in the two logged blocks was considerably lower than in the control, although the rate of residual tree loss was similar. This suggests that logging has, in part, anticipated natural mortality and has not adversely affected stability. In 22 years after logging at Whirinaki, mortality of merchantable trees occurred at similar rates. in all blocks, suggesting that logging has not adversely affected stability there either. Logging appears to have had little impact on regeneration of canopy species. Naturally regenerated Beilschmiedia tawa (A. Cunn.) Kirk (tawa) seedlings are widespread in both localities, and podocarp seedlings are widespread at Pureora but scarce at Whirinaki where podocarp population structures in virgin forest are not stable. At Pureora, gross volume increment in merchantable trees, mostly podo-carps, was higher in the unlogged control and in one logged block than the other (0. 5 - 0. 6 cf. 0. 3 m 3 /ha/annum). Net decrement occurred in all blocks, but was much higher in the control than either logged block. Total net decrement (i. e., including non-merchantable trees) is likely to be considerably higher. <b>Growth</b> <b>plots</b> in logged and virgin forest at Pureora indicate a likely average recovery period, for 80 % of equilibrium basal area, of nearly 100 years for selectively logged forest...|$|R
