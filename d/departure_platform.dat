5|$|Paddington {{became an}} {{important}} milk depot {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved to Old Oak Common. The main <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels. In 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington to Old Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of World War I but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year. Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year. The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas.|$|E
25|$|The diesel {{locomotives}} are {{used on the}} normal trains, with the steam locomotives being used on higher priced Heritage Steam trains. On arrival at Llanberis, diesel-hauled trains run directly from the arrival platform to the <b>departure</b> <b>platform,</b> load and depart at the scheduled time. Steam-hauled trains take at least {{half an hour to}} transfer from the arrival to the <b>departure</b> <b>platform,</b> thus making no more than one trip every three hours.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} platforms- Platforms 1 and 2 can be (and are) used for any {{combination}} of arrival or <b>departure.</b> <b>Platform</b> 3 cannot be used for arrivals from the West Coastway or departures towards London in the up direction.|$|E

25|$|When {{steam and}} diesel trains run together, it is normal for the diesel to lead up the mountain. This allows the steam train {{to enter the}} <b>departure</b> <b>{{platform}}</b> and load at its leisure, while the diesel moves across from the arrival platform from a quick turn-around.|$|E
25|$|The {{underground}} station at Waterloo was {{located within the}} existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the arrival and departure platforms in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after disembarkation of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, {{and then return to}} the <b>departure</b> <b>platform.</b> An additional lay-by siding was provided later.|$|E
25|$|As Piccadilly was {{originally}} a terminus of the system, one platform {{was originally}} used for arrivals from Altrincham, Bury, and later Eccles, {{and the other}} platform was used for departures. Empty trams ran from the arrival platform into a reversing siding in a tunnel, where they would reverse and then enter the <b>departure</b> <b>platform.</b> The stop was built with extension in mind, and since {{the opening of the}} extension towards Ashton in 2013, the former arrivals platform is also used for departures towards Ashton as well as terminating trams, while the former departures platform now also handles arrivals from Ashton. Terminating trams use a reversing siding on the Ashton line between Piccadilly and New Islington tram stops.|$|E
50|$|The {{double-sided}} and symmetrically arranged station building {{consisted of}} two protruding wings and a recessed central section. The neo-classical single-storey building included two 96 metres-long train sheds with arched arcades, one covering the arrival platforms and the other the <b>departure</b> <b>platforms.</b> Two other tracks ran between the train sheds that were designed for the movement of rolling stock. The two station buildings differed only with regard to a few functionally-related trifles. The <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> could only be accessed through an entrance hall, which contained a ticket office, baggage acceptance facilities and restaurants. In contrast, the arrival platforms were freely accessible and bigger to cope better with the surge of traffic when trains arrived.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} {{situated}} in an isolated space, implanted on level terrain, on {{the western end of}} the city of Porto, along the right margin of the Douro River. The principal facade is exposed to the Largo da Estação towards the urban centre of Campanhã, and its rear towards the railway lines and <b>departure</b> <b>platforms.</b> In actuality it is a central station to the city.|$|R
500|$|The station, {{the biggest}} in England, opened on 14 October 1852. Originally it had one arrival and one <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> (today's {{platforms}} 1 and 8), and the space between used for carriage sidings. [...] The platforms have been reconfigured several times. They have been numbered 1 to 8 since 1972.|$|E
500|$|The {{main station}} between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. [...] He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning , [...] and [...] The roof is [...] long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a -wide and -wide <b>departure</b> <b>platform,</b> [...] a [...] arrival platform, and a [...] combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The trainshed proved {{faster to}} {{construct}} and on 29 August 1850 Queen Victoria visited the station by train and formally opened it. The following day YN trains were diverted into it. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway transferred its terminal facilities into the new station on 1 January 1851. At this period it was customary to have separate [...] "arrival" [...] and [...] "departure" [...] platforms for terminating trains. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway used right-hand running, so that conveniently their west-facing <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> was located against the station buildings, enabling booking and waiting rooms to be located directly adjacent to the departing trains.|$|E
50|$|When {{the station}} opened in 1941, it was {{intended}} to serve 60,000 passengers a day. It had six <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> linked by underground passages and another platform for arrivals. Soon after its opening, it was found to be inadequate and poorly planned. The canopies over the platforms were too narrow to protect passengers from rain and sun, and interfered with loading of baggage onto the roofs of the buses.|$|R
5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate booking office on Drummond Street.|$|R

500|$|Paddington's {{capacity}} was {{doubled to}} four {{tracks in the}} 1870s. The quadrupling was completed to [...] on 30 October 1871, [...] in June 1879 and [...] in September 1884. An additional platform (later to become No.9) opened in June 1878, while two new <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> (later Nos.4and5) were added in 1885. One of the lines between what is now platform 5 and 7 was removed, in order that the latter could be moved to a more southerly position. Aside from the June 1878 work, Brunel's original roof structure remained untouched throughout the improvements.|$|R
6000|$|The elderly chauffeur {{showed no}} interest. He merely grunted and jerked down his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy's taxi {{came to rest}} at the <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> just after Whittington's. Tommy was behind him at the booking-office. He took a {{first-class}} single ticket to Bournemouth, Tommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the clock: [...] "You are early. You have nearly half an hour." ...|$|E
60|$|He rode into town, and {{the first}} thing he did was to seek out the music-hall artistes at their lodgings. He knew a good many of them. They gave him a welcome and a whiskey--but none of them had seen Ciccio. They sent him off to other artistes, other lodging-houses. He went the round of {{associates}} known and unknown, of lodgings strange and familiar, of third-rate possible public houses. Then he went to the Italians down in the Marsh--he knew these people always ask for one another. And then, hurrying, he dashed to the Midland Station, and then to the Great Central Station, asking the porters on the London <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> if they had seen his pal, a man with a yellow bicycle, and a black bicycle cape. All to no purpose.|$|E
60|$|About {{twenty minutes}} after two, on this eventful day, the vast and gloomy shed of Waterloo lay, like {{the temple of}} a dead religion, silent and deserted. Here and there {{at one of the}} platforms, a train lay becalmed; here and there a {{wandering}} footfall echoed; the cab-horses outside stamped with startling reverberations on the stones; or from the neighbouring wilderness of railway an engine snorted forth a whistle. The main-line <b>departure</b> <b>platform</b> slumbered like the rest; the booking-hutches closed; the backs of Mr. Haggard's novels, with which upon a weekday the bookstall shines emblazoned, discreetly hidden behind dingy shutters; the rare officials, undisguisedly somnambulant; and the customary loiterers, even to the middle-aged woman with the ulster and the handbag, fled to more congenial scenes. As in the inmost dells of some small tropic island the throbbing of the ocean lingers, so here a faint pervading hum and trepidation told in every corner of surrounding London.|$|E
5000|$|The track layout was reorganised in 1967, {{abolishing the}} {{distinction}} between arrival and <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> {{that had been a}} feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via [...] during this time. The station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year. Unlike other London termini such as Euston, the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} located on the {{southern}} side of the island's capital, Douglas, and is at the far landward end of the North quay close to the old town and finance centre. It has car parking available for railway patrons {{on the site of the}} former goods yard and <b>departure</b> <b>platforms</b> and is served by nearby bus services from many locations on the island. The current station buildings in red Ruabon brick were constructed between 1887 and 1913 replacing timber constructions established upon the opening of the line in 1873. The site was reclaimed from marshland, the nearby Lake Road attesting this fact.|$|R
