5|$|Obama's <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with some}} describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

In his <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> he thanked his {{predecessor}} Janez Drnovšek for his contribution to success and respect of Slovenia. Later, he also stated that he would work closely with Janša's government during Slovenia's six-month EU presidency.|$|E
5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

He taught English at Capuchino High School, and chaperoned the marching band in 1961 to Washington, D.C., to participate in President John F. Kennedy's inaugural parade.

5|$|The Bixby {{letter is}} a brief, consoling message sent by President Abraham Lincoln in November 1864 to Lydia Parker Bixby, a widow living in Boston, Massachusetts, who {{was thought to}} have lost five sons in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E

5|$|By 1532, Calvin {{received}} his licentiate {{in law and}} published his first book, a commentary on Seneca's De Clementia. After uneventful trips to Orléans and his hometown of Noyon, Calvin returned to Paris in October 1533. During this time, tensions rose at the Collège Royal (later to become the Collège de France) between the humanists/reformers and the conservative senior faculty members. One of the reformers, Nicolas Cop, was rector of the university. On 1 November 1533 he devoted his <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> {{to the need for}} reform and renewal in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{examined}} the relationship between the rated charisma of US presidents and their frequency of use of metaphors in <b>inaugural</b> <b>addresses.</b> In the first study, the incidence of metaphors was recorded from the first-term <b>inaugural</b> <b>addresses</b> of 36 presidents (17 high charisma; 19 low charisma). Charismatic presidents used nearly twice as many metaphors (adjusted for speech length) than non-charismatic presidents. In the second study, judges rated the passages from the speeches that they found most inspirational. Results suggested that metaphors are important for inspiring audience members. This work increases our understanding of the process by which charismatic leaders inspire and motivate followers. D 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The strenuous {{campaign}} took {{a decisive}} toll on Helm's already weakened body. He {{was too weak}} to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Washington had {{established}} his preeminence {{among the new}} nation's Founding Fathers through his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and {{as president of the}} 1787 Constitutional Convention. Once the Constitution was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first President of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but Washington proved an able leader.|$|E
5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.|$|E

These sources are subjected to critical scrutiny with the intention of establishing the strategies employed by the President to rally the American audience and international community towards his vision. The study has revealed that the President employs a multiplicity of coercive discourse patterns in his quest to garner popular support for his policies, and legitimacy in their implementation. The use of binaries, collective pronouns and lexical reiteration are some of the key weapons unleashed on the audience...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{on presidential}} <b>inaugural</b> <b>addresses</b> (PIAs) in Africa have mainly focused on rhetorical {{elements}} and general pragmatic enactments in such speeches. Through such studies, {{it has been}} brought out that an assortment of speech acts are used in PIAs. Nonetheless, the deployment nature of specific speech acts like assertives largely remains unexplored. Rooted in Searle’s taxonomy on speech acts (Searle, 1969), {{the present study investigates}} the use of assertives in five presidential <b>inaugural</b> <b>addresses</b> delivered by presidents of Ghana between 1993 and 2009. This study concludes that the presidents of Ghana mainly employ assertives to contextualise the country in terms of its past, present and future circumstances: the presidents usually paint the past of Ghana as murky, the present as encouraging and the future as promising. The assertives are thus used by the presidents to inspire the confidence of the populace in their respective governments. This study has implications for the literature on African presidential speeches {{as well as for the}} speech act theory...|$|R
