5|$|In October 1777, {{after more}} than two years in Congress, President Hancock {{requested}} a leave of absence. He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home. By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> delegates from other states.|$|E

At this time, relationships with their label was not at the best, and the band's personal lives were getting back into control. However, at the urging of their good friend and A, Eisley went back into the studio later in 2008 to record their third album. During the recording process, the band <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> one-off shows. Notably, they performed a benefit with the Seattle Symphony with Mateo Messina in 2008 and headlined a show at Baylor University in the spring of 2009, their first real show since the end of their Combinations tour.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 1937, MacDonald married Gene Raymond in a {{traditional}} ceremony at Wilshire Methodist Church in Los Angeles. They remained married until MacDonald's death. Raymond was also a songwriter, and MacDonald introduced two of his songs in her concerts. In addition to the TV pilot Prima Donna that Raymond wrote for her, they also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> radio shows together and toured in The Guardsman on stage. With their infrequent attempts to work together, including the film Smilin' Through, the public was indifferent to them as a team as evidenced by only fair box-office receipts. According to published books, including Sweethearts by Sharon Rich and The Golden Girls Of MGM by Jane Ellen Wayne, Gene Raymond engaged in numerous affairs with men and their marriage was problematic. MacDonald addressed this issue in her unpublished autobiography (now published in a facsimile edition; see Controversy section) and mentioned several separations and marital problems. After her death, Raymond and his friends (including the MacDonald fan club, which remained associated with Raymond until his death) disputed these claims.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, Shetty <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{modelling}} {{assignments and}} appeared in several television commercials. She later made her acting {{debut in the}} 1993 thriller Baazigar that earned her nominations for the Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Lux New Face of the Year. She subsequently earned wide recognition with dual roles in the 1994 action comedy Main Khiladi Tu Anari. After this initial success in her career, Shetty's films fared poorly {{at the box office}} {{for the next five years}} and garnered her negative reviews. The 2000 box office hit Dhadkan marked a turning point in her career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. Shetty rose to prominence by featuring as the female lead in three of India's annually top-grossing productions—the 2004 cop drama Garv, the 2005 Kannada film Auto Shankar and the 2007 family drama Apne—and received praise for her performances in the dramas Pardesi Babu (1998), Rishtey (2002) and Life in a... Metro (2007). Her acclaimed portrayal of an AIDS patient in the 2004 drama Phir Milenge garnered her several accolades, including a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Shetty became a global figure after winning the 2007 British reality television series Celebrity Big Brother 5, with 63% of the final vote, following an international racism controversy.|$|E

25|$|South Vietnamese forces {{included}} the relatively weak regular ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion, {{as well as}} territorial forces of 17 Regional Force (RF) companies and 47 Popular Force (PF) platoons; in total some 4,500 men. Making {{up the bulk of}} government units in Phuoc Tuy, the territorial forces varied in standard. Although most villages were garrisoned by an RF company operating from a fortified compound, and PF platoons guarded most hamlets and important infrastructure, their value was questionable. RF companies were technically available for tasks throughout the province, while PF platoons were mostly restricted to operating around their village, yet both were primarily defensive. While RF and PF units occasionally defended themselves successfully they rarely conducted offensive operations, and even when they did they were usually limited. Mostly recruited from the same population as their opponents, they were subject to the same motivations and pressures, and often suffered equally {{at the hands of the}} Viet Cong and a largely inept government. Poorly trained and unable to rely on being reinforced, the territorial forces usually provided little opposition to the Viet Cong. A US Advisory Team operated in support, as <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Australians from the AATTV. Yet despite their efforts the capabilities of South Vietnamese forces remained limited. Meanwhile, the arrival of 1 ATF further restricted their ability to operate in Phuoc Tuy as it increasingly came to dominate the province.|$|E
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of the programs that were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E

Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role. Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience. However, producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills. Gordon said, [...] "I'd never done any acting.

[...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way.

500|$|While Byrne and Eno <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{interviews}} for the album and subsequent tour, the two attempted {{to market the}} album via word-of-mouth and Internet hype rather than a traditional marketing scheme. Eno was convinced {{in part because of}} his own preferences for digital music from the iTunesStore rather than CDs as well as the success of Radiohead's 2007 album InRainbows and the self-promotional strategies of NineInchNails for the albums YearZero, Ghosts I–IV, and TheSlip. Byrne was also impressed by Radiohead's release strategy as a means of valuing music. The duo carefully avoided Internetleaks by not giving out promotional copies of the album to journalists, but Byrne did preview the song [...] "OneFineDay" [...] prior to the release by performing it with a choir of senior citizens and Eno invited MarkColes for the BBCWorldService program TheBeat to his home to listen to the songs on Eno's laptop. In 2017, Byrne revealed that he and Eno had collaborated again on Byrne's next solo album.|$|E
500|$|Mokashi <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> small-time {{roles for}} Hindi TV serials and feature films, {{including}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) but soon {{he turned to}} writing and directing. Mokashi came across a biography of Dadasaheb Phalke, {{also known as the}} father of Indian cinema, written by Bapu Watve. With an idea of making film on Phalke, Mokashi started his research with the help of National Film Archive of India, Pune and finished the script by March 2005. As Mokashi did not undergo any formal training for film-making and did not assist any other film directors earlier, he found it difficult to find producers for the film and it took three years to raise finances for the film. Declining the suggestions of making the film in Hindi, casting big stars, adding at least one title track, Mokashi decided to produce the film by himself through his production company, [...] "Mayasabha Productions". Made with the budget of , Mokashi had to mortgage his house to complete the film.|$|E
500|$|When {{the group}} arrived in California, Nirvana <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days of {{pre-production}} where {{the band and}} Vig tightened {{up some of the}} song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song [...] "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes were not satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Cobain used a variety of guitars, from Stratocasters to Jaguars, and Novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 Gibson Ripper. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: [...] "He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
