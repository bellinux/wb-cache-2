5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> management plans are described below.|$|E
5|$|Under President Obama the Department of Energy (DOE) was {{reviewing}} options {{other than}} Yucca Mountain for a <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, {{established by the}} Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy. In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E
25|$|More compact than aqueous methods, {{allowing}} on-site reprocessing at {{the reactor}} site, which avoids transportation of spent fuel and its security issues, instead storing {{a much smaller}} volume of fission products on site as <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> until decommissioning. For example, the Integral Fast Reactor and Molten Salt Reactor fuel cycles are based on on-site pyroprocessing.|$|E
50|$|It is {{essential}} that radioactive waste should be made safe and placed in permanent storage. <b>High-level</b> <b>wastes,</b> in their temporary storage facilities, have to be managed and kept cool to prevent fire and leaks which would otherwise contaminate large areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>High-level</b> {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> management concerns how {{radioactive materials}} created during production {{of nuclear power}} and nuclear weapons are dealt with. Radioactive waste contains a mixture of short-lived and long-lived nuclides, as well as non-radioactive nuclides. There was reported some 47,000 tonnes of <b>high-level</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> stored in the USA in 2002.|$|R
40|$|Methodology for the {{acquisition}} of geological data required for the evaluation and provision of longterm safety of nuclear waste underground disposal (storage) systems is considered {{on the basis of}} the conceptual approach to the closing stage of radioactive waste (RW) management, which envisages fractionating of liquid <b>high-level</b> <b>wastes</b> (HLW) with the separation of fractions containing radionuclides with different half-life...|$|R
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{does not}} reduce {{the volume of}} <b>high-level</b> <b>waste,</b> it separates out the useful isotopes leaving an increased volume of liquid <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> {{as a result of}} the solution-based chemical processes used to dissolve fuel rods and extract useful isotopes. It does reduce total radioactivity of the total waste, however the overall volume of the waste is higher and it does not eliminate waste nor heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), the environmental risks of the aqueous and organic waste streams, and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration stepped back from President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research. Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia and Japan.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} termed Remix & Return would blend <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> with uranium {{mine and}} mill tailings {{down to the}} level of the original radioactivity of the uranium ore, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{storage of}} {{radioactive}} waste requires the stabilization {{of the waste}} into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that {{one way to do}} this might be through vitrification. Currently at Sellafield the <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> (PUREX first cycle raffinate) is mixed with sugar and then calcined. Calcination involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.|$|E
40|$|Accumulated liquid <b>high-level</b> <b>wastes</b> (HLW) {{from nuclear}} centers in Russia and the United States (U. S.) contain great amounts of nonradioactive salts; it is prudent to vitrify not the entire volume of these wastes, {{but only the}} {{concentrates}} of radionuclides recovered from them. For this purpose, different pretreatment technologies based on liquid-liquid extraction are under development...|$|R
40|$|The Hanford Site is the DOE's largest legacy waste site, with uranium (U) from {{plutonium}} processing being a major contaminant in its subsurface. Accidental {{release of}} highly concentrated <b>high-level</b> <b>wastes</b> left {{large quantities of}} U in the vadose zone under tank farms. The U contamination {{has been found in}} groundwater beneath the tank farms, indicating U is mobile...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{progress at}} three collaborating US national laboratories on {{the extraction of}} the fission products {sup 99 }Tc and {sup 137 }Cs from alkaline <b>high-level</b> <b>wastes</b> (HLW). Efficient, economical processes for Tc and Cs extraction (SRTALK and alkaline-side CSEX, respectively) have been developed, and testing has progressed through batch tests on actual wastes and continuous countercurrent centrifugal-contactor tests on simulants...|$|R
25|$|Transuranic waste (TRUW) {{as defined}} by U.S. {{regulations}} is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100nCi/g (3.7MBq/kg), excluding <b>high-level</b> <b>waste.</b> Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).|$|E
25|$|The President was {{required}} to review site recommendations and submit to Congress by March 31, 1987 his recommendation of one site for the first repository, and by March 31, 1990, his recommendation for a second repository. The amount of <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> or spent fuel that could {{be placed in the}} first repository was limited to the equivalent of 70,000 metric tons of heavy metal until a second repository was built. The Act required the national government to take ownership of all nuclear waste or spent fuel at the reactor site, transport it to the repository, and thereafter be responsible for its containment.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{reduces the}} volume of <b>high-level</b> <b>waste,</b> but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not {{eliminate the need for}} a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. Several different methods for reprocessing been tried, but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{controversy}} over <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> disposal {{is a major}} constraint on the nuclear power’s global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian <b>high-level</b> nuclear <b>waste,</b> although Finland is in the advanced stage {{of the construction of}} such facility, the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository. Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide. Deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with <b>high-level</b> nuclear <b>waste.</b> The Morris Operation is currently the only de facto <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> storage site in the United States.|$|R

25|$|Firstly, the International Court of Justice, {{prompted}} {{especially by}} New Zealand, has declared {{the deployment of}} nuclear weapons to be illegal. This justifies taking an even stronger stance on where they may be carried. The numbers of those weapons, and the States holding them, have increased, despite {{the end of the}} cold war. Uncertainties around the intentions of nuclear states and the location and safety of weapons have made disarmament an even more urgent priority now than it was in the 1980s. Secondly, nuclear fuel reprocessing has gone global, with shipments of highly hazardous plutonium mixed-oxide fuel and <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> passing regularly between Japan and Europe, sometimes through the Tasman Sea.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} Sellafield area will become a major dumping ground for {{unwanted}} nuclear material, since there are currently no long-term facilities for storing <b>High-Level</b> <b>Waste</b> (HLW), although the UK has current contracts to reprocess spent fuel {{from all over the}} world. Contracts agreed since 1976 between BNFL and overseas customers require that all HLW be returned to the country of origin. The UK retains low- and intermediate-level waste resulting from its reprocessing activity, and instead ships out a radiologically equivalent amount of its own HLW. This substitution policy is intended to be environmentally neutral and to speed return of overseas material by reducing the number of shipments required, since HLW is far less bulky.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear waste has {{contaminated}} Cattaraugus Creek {{and other}} areas around West Valley, New York. Although {{almost all of the}} <b>high-level</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> has been removed, according to the Department of Energy (DOE), nuclear and hazardous wastes are still buried in unlined trenches on two sites at a former privately operated nuclear fuels reprocessing facility alongside Cattaraugus Creek north of the village of West Valley in Cattaraugus County. The DOE's Demonstration Project at the site transferred <b>high-level</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> into glass canisters. Reprocessing of spent fuel rods from military and civilian nuclear power plants between 1966 and 1972 resulted in burial of low-level radioactive waste (LLNW) on 22 acre and burial of <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> on another 7 acre there.|$|R
500|$|However, soon before {{groundbreaking}} was {{slated to}} begin in 2015, the project was stopped because of a mix of geological, technical, political and ecological problems. By late 2015, the Regional Government considered it [...] "obsolete" [...] and effectively [...] "paralyzed." [...] As of early 2017, the project has not been shelved but it stays frozen and no further action is expected anytime soon. Meanwhile, the spent nuclear fuel and other <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> is being kept in the plants' pools, as well as on-site dry cask storage (almacenes temporales individualizados) in Garoña and Trillo.|$|E
500|$|Spain {{has five}} active nuclear plants with seven {{reactors}} which produced 21% of the country's electricity in 2013. Furthermore, there is legacy <b>high-level</b> <b>waste</b> from another two older, closed plants. Between 2004 and 2011, a bipartisan {{initiative of the}} Spanish Government promoted {{the construction of an}} interim centralized storage facility (ATC, [...] ), similar to the Dutch COVRA concept. In late 2011 and early 2012 the final green light was given, preliminary studies were being completed and land was purchased near Villar de Cañas (Cuenca) after a competitive tender process. The facility would be initially licensed for 60 years.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{countries}} are considerably {{ahead of the}} United States in developing plans for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Sweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and <b>high-level</b> <b>waste.</b> [...] "An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium." ...|$|E
40|$|The American Nuclear Society (ANS) {{supports}} (1) {{the development}} and use of geological repositories for disposal of <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>wastes</b> and (2) expeditious processing of the Yucca Mountain license application in an open, technically sound manner. Geological disposal means placing the wastes hundreds of feet underground and far from the biosphere. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is following a legislatively well-defined regulatory process to evaluate the safety of the proposed Yucca Mountain Site to meet both the scientific requirements and the institutional requirements. Generation of electricity using nuclear energy produces wastes that require long-term isolation from the biosphere. Radioactive wastes decay over time to nonradioactive wastes; thus, safe disposal is based on isolation of <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>wastes</b> until most of the radioactivity has decayed away. The U. S. National Academy of Sciences and the equivalent scientific advisory panels in every major country support geological disposal of such wastes as the preferred safe method for their ultimate disposal. 1 The United States has one operating geological repository: the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. This repository houses long-lived transuranic wastes from the production of nuclear weapons and research, development, and demonstration activities; the most abundant transuranic element in these wastes is plutonium. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository is primarily for <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>wastes</b> from nuclear power plants; about ten percent of the repository is for defense-related <b>high-level</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{container}} (net 400 kg) of vitrified <b>high-level</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> has {{an average}} radioactivity of 4x1015 Bq (Max 45x1015 Bq).|$|R
2500|$|Radioactivity {{naturally}} decays over time, so {{radioactive waste}} {{has to be}} isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it no longer poses a threat. The time radioactive waste must be stored for depends {{on the type of}} waste and radioactive isotopes. [...] Current [...] approaches to managing radioactive waste have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate level waste, and deep burial or partitioning / transmutation for the <b>high-level</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Under U.S. law, {{transuranic}} {{waste is}} further categorized into [...] "contact-handled" [...] (CH) and [...] "remote-handled" [...] (RH) {{on the basis}} of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 mrem per hour (2mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200mrem/h (2mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of <b>high-level</b> <b>waste,</b> nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 mrem/h (10,000mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in New Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|<b>High-level</b> <b>waste</b> is full {{of highly}} {{radioactive}} fission products, {{most of which are}} relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in deep geological storage, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become [...] "plutonium mines", from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, the high radioactivity and heat (80 C in surrounding rock) greatly increases the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.|$|E
