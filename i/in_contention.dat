5|$|Dick Advocaat {{replaced}} van Gaal {{as national}} team manager in January 2002, and Hasselbaink remained <b>in</b> <b>contention.</b> On 21 August, {{he came on}} as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Norway at the Ullevaal Stadion, and on 7 September he scored in a 3–0 victory over Belarus, the opening qualifying game for UEFA Euro 2004; this was his last appearance for Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, there was once again intense media {{speculation}} about the Spaniard's future, and in June 2010, a €35million bid from Barcelona was rejected. The 2010–11 season {{turned out to be an}} extremely competitive one in the Premier League; even though Arsenal had lost five games before mid-season, they were jostling for pole position with Manchester United and Manchester City. Going into late February, Arsenal were still <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the quadruple, but within a span of two weeks they lost in the League Cup final, were eliminated by Barcelona in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, and defeated in the FA Cup quarter-final. Although Fàbregas did not play in the League Cup Final, it was his misplaced backheel pass during the second leg of the Champions League game against Barcelona that allowed them to level the aggregate score. Arsenal remained <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the league title until a series of draws in the final third of the season caused them to fall too far behind league leaders Manchester United; they ended the season fourth. The following season was once again marked by uncertainty. Barcelona made several bids for Fàbregas, while Nasri, Arsenal's star performer the previous campaign, was courted by Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's first match {{after the}} final was against Portsmouth in the Premier League. A 2–0 win ensured they {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the league, though by May finished in second place. Chelsea did however beat Manchester United to win the 2007 FA Cup Final and complete a cup double. Arsenal played Blackburn Rovers a few days {{after the final}} in a FA Cup replay. They lost the match 1–0; it was Arsenal's third defeat in all competitions which represented their worst run of form in five years.|$|E

5|$|During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League {{in double}} plays {{made by a}} second baseman {{for the second year}} in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.|$|E

Despite the loss, Ella was voted Best Dressed at the 41st Golden Bell Awards.|$|E
5|$|Entering the race, {{the only}} two drivers still <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the IndyCar Championship were Ganassi's Franchitti and Penske's Power. Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power, retaking the {{championship}} points lead from him with a second-place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior. Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an awful finish at Kentucky, but needed to finish far ahead of Franchitti {{in order to win}} the championship title.|$|E

5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} final race of the season, two drivers were still <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the World Drivers' Championship. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading with 78 points; Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve was second with 77 points, one point behind Schumacher. Behind Schumacher and Villeneuve in the Drivers' Championship, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third on 41 points in the other Williams, with Jean Alesi and David Coulthard on 36 and 30 points respectively. Villeneuve had won two more races than Schumacher during the season, meaning that {{in the event of}} a tie on points, the rules stated Villeneuve would be world champion.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although {{he would no longer}} be <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.|$|E

Three were named to the All-ACC second-team: Ralph Felton, Bob Morgan, and Bill Walker.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill was {{replaced}} by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup. Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for {{two weeks in the}} autumn and remaining <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 of the 2009 Giro d'Italia {{took place}} on 21 May; the race {{concluded}} with Stage 21 on 31 May. The {{second half of the}} Giro began with a long and challenging individual time trial in Cinque Terre. It was in this time trial that Denis Menchov took the overall lead in the race. This was followed by a flat stage, after which most of the sprinters in the Giro withdrew from the race, as they did not figure to be <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> in the hilly and mountainous stages to follow.|$|E

5|$|The Camp Nou {{stadium in}} Barcelona, Spain, was {{selected}} as the venue for the final {{at a meeting of the}} UEFA Executive Committee in Lisbon, Portugal, on 6 October 1998. The selection process had begun more than four months earlier, in May 1998, when FC Barcelona submitted the Camp Nou as a contender to host the match in recognition of the club's centenary year. The other venues <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> to host the match were London's Wembley Stadium and Marseille's Stade Vélodrome, but the Camp Nou was considered by UEFA's Stadiums Commission to be the favourite for its superior security, comfort and capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow was {{selected}} as the venue for the match {{at a meeting of the}} UEFA Executive Committee in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 4 October 2006. The committee – who decided the venue for the 2009 final and the 2008 and 2009 UEFA Cup Finals at the same meeting – based their decision on a number of factors, including stadium capacity, safety and security facilities, and accessibility. The other venues <b>in</b> <b>contention</b> were the Estadio Olímpico in Sevilla, the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Wembley Stadium in London, and the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was chosen to host the 2009 final.|$|E
5|$|The Pros {{were now}} {{recognized}} as the top team in Ohio, and the Triangles had a rematch against the Pros.

Pollard returned a punt for a touchdown {{in the first quarter}} and had one receiving touchdown in the third quarter from King, and the Triangles received their second loss of the year.|$|E

However, Alabama completed the regular season with only nine victories and losses to South Carolina, LSU and Auburn and finished fourth in the Western Division. After the regular season, the Crimson Tide accepted an invitation {{to compete in the}} Capital One Bowl in Orlando. Against Big Ten co-champions Michigan State, Alabama won by a final score of 49–7 and captured both a third straight ten win season and top ten finish.|$|E
