40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the methodologies {{employed in the}} U. S. international economic accounts, in valuing direct investment in prices of the current period. Under international standards, all {{of the components of}} the international investment position should reflect current period prices, rather than historical cost or book values. Virtually all of the categories in the international investment position accounts except <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> can be directly estimated in prices of the current period with reference to readily observable market prices. For example, the value of positions in portfolio investment securities, gold, loans, currencies, and bank deposits can be directly estimated based on face values or market prices of recent transactions. In contrast, <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> typically involve illiquid ownership interests in companies that may possess many unique attributes - such as customer base, management, and ownership of intangible assets - whose value in the current period are difficult to determine, because there is no widely accepted standard for revaluing company financial statements at historical cost into prices of the current period. ...|$|E
40|$|This Coordinated Direct Investment Survey Guide {{has been}} {{prepared}} to assist economies in participating in the 2009 Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS). The CDIS is being conducted {{under the auspices of}} the IMF‘s Statistics Department across a wide range of economies. The survey is conducted simultaneously by all participating economies with respect to end-of-December 2009, uses consistent definitions, and encourages best practices in collecting data on foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions.</b> The CDIS is thus a unique tool in capturing world totals and the geographic distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions,</b> thereby contributing to important new understandings of the extent of globalization, and improving the overall quality of direct investment data worldwide. A pragmatic strategy has been adopted in conducting the CDIS. The CDIS is fully consistent with the fourth edition of the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment and the sixth edition of the IMF‘s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, but where these standards offer compilers a choice of methods (such as in identifying units that are in a direct investment relationship), this guide favors simplified methods over conceptually ideal methods for economies that do not have fully developed data collection and compilation systems in place. Should the CDIS become a regular undertaking, the IMF‘s Statistics Department will encourage compilers to refine and improve simplified methods over time, to move them closer to conceptually ideal methods as circumstances may warrant.

40|$|At {{a time of}} {{historic}} challenges to {{the viability of the}} Eurozone, we assess the contribution of the EU and the Euro to equity market integration in Europe. We use a simple and essentially model free measure of bilateral market segmentation: two countries are segmented if there is a wide divergence in the valuations of their industries. We first establish that segmentation is significantly lower for EU versus non- EU members. Bilateral valuation differentials remain lower for EU members even after we control for several possible channels of integration, such as bilateral trade, <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions,</b> financial regulation, and interest rate differences. Importantly, we find that EU membership reduces equity market segmentation between member countries whether or not members have also adopted the Euro. The Euro adoption as well as the anticipation of the Euro adoption has minimal effects on market integration. ...|$|E

Second, we apply quarterly data to the estimated models to generate quarter valuations and implement a procedure that ensures that the estimated valuations for the four quarters in a given year sum to the reported annual valuation adjustments.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the various means for valuing unlisted {{equity in the}} context of foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics. The objective is to contribute to the international efforts of improving market value estimates and the guidelines on how international direct investment activity should be measured. Moreover, this study explores the impacts that market approximation has on Finnish FDI figures and international investment position during 2005 - 2011. This study is carried out by first analyzing how different valuation methods perform in an international context. Valuation models are tested with data taken from all listed companies of 27 European Union member states during 2005 - 2011. Finally, the models that are applicable in FDI valuation context and lead to lowest valuation errors are applied to the valuation of unlisted FDI in Finland. The results suggest that when developing models for valuing unlisted direct investment equity, focus should be laid on price-to-book value methods. The results indicate as well that the current valuation practice, which is based on the book values of equity, generates lower <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> when compared to market value approximations. Additionally, the results imply that Finland's overall external financial position might be strongly understated, when the valuation of unlisted direct investment equity is based on the book values...|$|E
40|$|The {{mandate of}} the Task Force on Valuation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Positions was to review the methods to value <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> stated in Annex III of the Guideline ECB/ 2011 / 23 on External Statistics. In particular, {{the work of the}} Task Force was focused on {{reviewing}} recent developments that may justify amendments to the current method and assessing whether new methods to be applied in the national contributions to the euro area aggregate would lead to a more reliable international investment position (i. i. p.), in particular by increasing the consistency in the valuation of FDI assets and liabilities. The report concluded that in some cases where the use of own funds at book value (OFBV) data would lead to significant biases in the national net i. i. p., other valuation methods than OFBV could be used, adding that national compilers shall exchange information on those positions with the other relevant Member State(s). National compilers should then consider, on a case-bycase basis, adjusting the valuation of those positions in order to strive for a consistent recording of these investments by counterpart EU countries.

40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case of portfolio investment transactions, we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the net liability position of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s net liability position increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas revaluations and other adjustments explain the remaining 47, 3 %. The latter is broken own into 27, 6 % due to price effects, 10, 1 % to exchange rate changes, and 9, 6 % to other adjustments. ...|$|E

The results show that FDI has a positive effect on trade balance because the trade balance in Kenya is negative.

Our sectoral analysis shows up important differences between Ireland's outward FDI and the bulk of FDI occurring in the world economy however. Ireland's outward FDI flows are as yet almost exclusively horizontal and they go largely into non-internationally-tradable manufacturing and services sectors.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} balance of payments and its influence on international <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> of Central and Eastern European countries in the period 1996 - 2006. During that period CEE countries experienced high current account deficits covered by rising foreign capital flows. That led to {{a sharp increase in}} foreign liabilities. However, a deterioration of net foreign <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> stemmed mainly from a rise in negative foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>position.</b> What is more, main international liquidity ratios (such as reserve to net international position in portfolio and other investment or reserve to import outlays) did not deteriorate much and some (such as reserve to debt, export revenues to debt) even improved. That influenced positively credibility of CEE countries. Based on experience of selected Western countries the author claims that positive scenario for future developments in CEE balance of payments is more probable than a negative one. Nevertheless the pessimistic scenario should be kept in mind and thorough analysis of balance of payments stability continued.

40|$|The paper {{explains}} that FDI statistics should fulfil user needs {{other than those}} related to BOP and IIP. In that regard, issues mentioned in the Annotated Outline pertaining to the geographical allocation and to UBOs and UBAs should also be addressed {{in the context of}} FDI statistics, not just in the FATS area. In essence, the paper proposed that <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>position</b> and income data be calculated for each country where <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> enterprises are located, rather than just for the countries where the direct investor has a direct position or with which it has a transaction.

Country features that our analysis takes into account are population, income, the land-labor ratio, the average level of education, and region.

S. economic relations with Japan and Western Europe provide an important exception. Despite U. S. concern about its trade deficit with Japan, we find Japan to be much more open to the United States, not only as a source of imports, but also as a destination for U.

S. economic relationships in that the residual correlation among exports, imports, and outward <b>direct</b> foreign <b>investment</b> is much larger than would be the case if these magnitudes were independent across countries. ...|$|R

We also explore the welfare and distributional effects of international capital fl ows and show that the patterns of capital flows may reverse along the convergence process of a developing country.

BPM 5 discusses {{the distinction between the}} transaction principle and the debtor/creditor principle. In both cases reference is made to the immediate host/investing country of the transactor or debtor/creditor, respectively. Financial flows may be geographically allocated either {{on the basis of the}} transaction principle or on the basis of the debtor/creditor principle (§ 482). International <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> data are to be allocated on the basis of the debtor/creditor principle (§ 484). 2. The OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> (Benchmark Definition) also recommends that <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> flows, income and stocks be allocated to the country of the immediate host/investing country (§§ 46 - 47). 3. The Benchmark Definition, however, suggests that the stocks of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> net assets be also compiled in respect of the ultimate host or controlling country (§ 45). II. Concerns/shortcomings of the current treatmen...|$|R
