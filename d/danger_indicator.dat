40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: a {{selection}} of the complex of materials, reducing the potential danger of the combustion products at arising of {{the fire in the}} passenger car. The methodical approaches to studying the potential danger of the volatile combustion products have been developed, the criterion of danger, the methods of determination of the potential <b>danger</b> <b>indicator</b> have been justified. The studied materials have been used in cars building in the Tversky Car-Building Plant. The normative documents have been developed, the methodical recommendation have been introduced as well as the new fire-protected materialsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Sources {{warn the}} global HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{will not be}} halted without significant reductions in Intimate partner violence (IPV). South African women have been hardest hit by the HIV-IPV link, suffering deleterious health outcomes as sequelae of significant barriers to HIV care. Extant literature focuses on HIV prevention, {{and there is a}} paucity of effective methods for mitigating IPV-related barriers among women living with HIV. This study was a Phase II trial testing the effectiveness and safety of the HIV IPV Risk and Safety (HIRS) protocol administered to women experiencing IPV and testing HIV+ during mobile HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT). Research questions compared experiences between a Standard of Care and an Experimental group with two dosage levels. All participants (N= 255) were black South African females residing in Gauteng province and aged about 33 years (M= 33). Two psychometric instruments were created for this study: the <b>Danger</b> <b>Indicator</b> and the HIRS scale with the latter having good reliability (Cronbach alpha. 882) but both needing refinement in validity. The protocol was shown to be effective in mitigating violence upon partner notification of serostatus (X 2 (1) = 7. 83, p=. 005) and promoting linkage to care, with participants aged 33 - 43 years trending towards significant (X 2 (1) = 3. 57, p=. 059). The protocol was found to be feasible to implement, having impressive retention, brevity in administration, and high usage of safety strategies with minimal risks resulting from participation. Satisfaction was confirmed through positive participant ratings and safety through both non-significant group differences on the HIRS scale (t(1, 237) = - 1. 09; p=. 278) and the perceived benefits of study participation far outweighing harms. Women receiving the protocol displayed notable self-determination towards self-protection and suffered significantly less re-assault upon partner notification. The number of participants utilizing certain safety strategies suggests this brief intervention was effective in galvanizing South African women to reclaim power and act towards the betterment of their health. Findings herald the promise of a protocol that effectively mitigates IPV to improve HIV outcomes. The effectiveness of the HIRS protocol, in facilitating safe partner notification of serostatus, could be a significant contribution to the knowledge base, but {{more research is needed to}} confirm these results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new tool}} has been {{developed}} to help firefighters interpret outputs of a fire danger rating system. The Fire Danger Pocket Card for Firefighter Safety (or Pocket Card) is a laminated, pocket sized sheet containing locally significant historical fire danger information. The concept of and template for the Pocket Card were created by the National Advisory Group for Fire Danger Rating. The idea for the card came from a fire incident in North Carolina at which prophetic fire <b>danger</b> <b>indicators</b> were not understood by firefighters. The Pocket Card displays historical reference points for local areas including daily all-time worst and average index values, date and size {{for a couple of}} significant fires, seasonal trends of active and less active fire seasons, and thresholds of other weather or fuel conditions. Given the daily values for the fire danger indices, the Pocket Card enables the firefighter to track the current seasonal trend, to put into context the day’s index value, and to quickly gauge the potential difficulty of the day’s fire suppression efforts. Due to the local memory displayed, Pocket Cards are valuable to out-of-area crews as well as local firefighters. For this reason, a websit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gas {{emission}} dynamic {{prediction is}} a non-contact and continuous outburst prediction method. It {{is based on}} the difference of gas emission characteristics whether the working face exists dangerous factors, selecting appropriate indicators to predict outburst <b>danger.</b> The <b>indicators</b> that reflect abnormal gas emission is divided into four types: gas content, desorption characteristics, gas emission fluctuation and gas emission trend change. This paper gives the calculation model of A index that reflect desorption gas content, B index that reflect coal structure and desorption gas characteristics, S index of gas emission standard deviation, Kv index of gas emission variation coefficient. The validity of the real-time prediction using gas emission index for the working face outburst danger is verified by typical cases. ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{purpose of}} the project was to examine the {{internal}} consistency and structure of the English version of the Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS). Participants were 202 (79 % females) psychology undergraduates at James Cook University. Participants completed the STARS, the Statistical Anxiety Scale, and the Attitudes toward Statistics scale. Acceptable internal consistency reliabilities, ranging from. 81 to. 94, were found in this sample. Approximate fit indices suggest that a correlated six first-order factor model best describes the data in contrast to theoretical considerations suggesting that a six factor model with two correlated superordinate factors (i. e. statistics anxiety and attitudes toward statistics) best describes the data. The second {{purpose of the}} project was to examine the role of attentional bias in statistics anxiety in three experiments. Participants were 94 (73 % females), 99 (68 % females), and 104 (67 % females) psychology undergraduates at James Cook University, respectively. These participants had either never taken a statistics course before but expected to enrol in one in the future, were currently enrolled in a statistics course, or had successfully completed at least one statistics course but were not currently enrolled in a statistics course. Participants completed the emotional Stroop task and the dot probe task, the STARS, the Social Desirability Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. No statistically significant differences were found across the experiments, indicating an absence of attentional bias in statistics anxiety. Implications include a reconsideration of the cognitive mechanisms underlying statistics anxiety. Specifically, individuals with statistics anxiety might be interpreting danger based on the absence of safety indicators instead of the presence of <b>danger</b> <b>indicators.</b> Alternatively, another form of cognitive bias, such as an interpretation bias might underlie statistics anxiety. Future research should be conducted to compare the plausibility of these two explanations...|$|R
