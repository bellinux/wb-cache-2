5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> jury and five {{were found guilty}} of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, {{a leader in the}} Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence.

In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van der Sloot with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud.

On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek Van der Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a <b>federal</b> <b>grand</b> jury formally indicted Van der Sloot of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van der Sloot.|$|E

5000|$|Architecturally, many Bay Village homes {{look like}} smaller {{versions}} of Beacon Hill townhouses.
