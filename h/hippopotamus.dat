5|$|Three {{species of}} <b>hippopotamus,</b> the European <b>hippopotamus</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> antiquus), <b>Hippopotamus</b> major and <b>Hippopotamus</b> gorgops, ranged {{throughout}} continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way to}} many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (<b>Hippopotamus</b> creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus,</b> <b>Hippopotamus</b> minor), Malta (<b>Hippopotamus</b> melitensis), and Sicily (<b>Hippopotamus</b> pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> survived {{until the end of the}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy <b>hippopotamus,</b> this species was {{originally}} classified as <b>Hippopotamus</b> along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the same size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy <b>hippopotamus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common <b>hippopotamus,</b> H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy <b>hippopotamus.</b> The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> or the Cyprus dwarf <b>hippopotamus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} home to herds of <b>hippopotami.</b> As of 2007, there were about 115 <b>hippopotami</b> per {{kilometer}} of the savannah and grass steppe along the Rutshuru River.|$|R
50|$|Pseudoruminant is a {{classification}} of animals {{based on its}} digestive tract differing from the ruminants. Hippopotamidae (comprising <b>hippopotami)</b> are ungulate mammals with a three-chambered stomach (ruminants have a four-chambered stomach). Camels & <b>hippopotami</b> are examples of pseudoruminants.|$|R
50|$|Schistosoma edwardiense and Schistosoma <b>hippopotami</b> are parasites of the hippo.|$|R
5|$|<b>Hippopotamus</b> lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern <b>hippopotamus</b> of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the <b>hippopotamus</b> to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern <b>hippopotamus,</b> but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> (also known as Malagasy dwarf <b>hippopotamus</b> or Malagasy pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now {{believed}} to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant <b>hippopotamus</b> and pygmy <b>hippopotamus.</b> The fossil record suggests that at least one species of <b>hippopotamus</b> lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the mid-19th century by Alfred Grandidier, who unearthed nearly 50 individual hippos from a dried-up swamp at 'Ambolisatra' (thought to be Ambolisaka, near Lake Ihotry), {{a few miles from}} the Mozambique Channel. As many as four different species of <b>hippopotamus</b> were subsequently identified by various researchers. In a careful revision of the fossil record of the Malagasy hippos, Solweig Stuenes concluded that there were only two species of <b>hippopotamus</b> which she classified as <b>Hippopotamus</b> lemerlei and <b>Hippopotamus</b> madagascariensis. In 1990, Faure and Guerin discovered a distinct third species of hippo, which they named <b>Hippopotamus</b> laloumena. In a review of Stuenes work, Harris suggested that Hip. madagascariensis had much in common with the extant pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> of West Africa. Since the extant pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> was placed in the genus Hexaprotodon, he used the name Hex. madagascariensis. Some taxonomists, however, consider the modern pygmy hippo to belong to the genus Choeropsis, so this species may also be classified as C. madagascariensis.|$|E

5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern <b>hippopotamus,</b> likely {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. Fossil {{evidence}} indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy <b>hippopotamus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans and {{artiodactyls}} now {{are classified}} under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still {{referred to as}} Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. The <b>hippopotamus</b> and pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, {{distinct}} from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern <b>hippopotamus</b> and pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the modern}} pygmy <b>hippopotamus,</b> the Malagasy pygmy hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of the}} pygmy <b>hippopotamus.</b> The Malagasy pygmy hippo is {{similarly}} less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested highlands of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The fossils clearly {{belong to}} a <b>hippopotamus,</b> but one much larger than any {{previously}} described Madagascan species. From what is known, the species closely resembled the modern <b>hippopotamus,</b> but was somewhat smaller.|$|E
5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of <b>hippopotamus</b> reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male <b>hippopotamus</b> spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female <b>hippopotamus</b> will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E

5|$|The <b>hippopotamus</b> is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy <b>hippopotamus</b> belongs to a {{different}} genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy <b>hippopotamus.</b> It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of <b>hippopotamus</b> represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

40|$|Katavi National Park (KNP) is a stronghold for <b>hippopotami</b> in Tanzania. To {{predict the}} {{probable}} effects of future changes in water availability, annual variations in rainfall, river level, river discharge, ground water levels and the lateral extent of swamps used by <b>hippopotami,</b> {{were related to}} annual variations in their behaviour, distribution and abundance in aquatic shelter sites. Rainfall did not change consistently between 1950 and 2010. In contrast river levels and flow decreased over between 1990 and 2010. It is concluded that these reductions {{have been caused by}} an increase in irrigation of rice fields increasingly planted in upstream regions of the catchment area. Rainfall fell in a pronounced annual cycle. The wet season started in December, increased in January, decreased in February reaching an annual peak in March. The dry season lasted from May to November. Variation in height, biomass and greenness of ground layer swards used by feeding <b>hippopotami,</b> closely mirror this annual pattern of rainfall. As the dry season progresses <b>hippopotami</b> become increasingly aggregated in remaining aquatic shelter sites by day, to wallow and thermoregulate with concomitant depletion of the nocturnal feeding grounds close to remaining shelter sites. Five observation sites were chosen, representing a gradient in the amount of water persisting through the dry season. <b>Hippopotami</b> showed spatial differences in their activity budgets and the frequency of behavioural events at these sites, which were consistent with the way they responded to variation in water availability between seasons. Extrapolating these findings to predict responses to future changes in global climate and land use, I conclude consistent implementation of existing national laws governing diversion of water from rivers up-stream of the park will be crucial for maintaining vigorous populations of <b>hippopotami</b> in KNP. Similar problems of a catchment area scale occur in other National Parks in Africa...|$|R

5|$|Hippos {{have also}} been popular cartoon characters, where their rotund frames are used for humorous effect. For example, the Disney film Fantasia {{featured}} a ballerina <b>hippopotamus</b> dancing to the opera La Gioconda, and Hanna-Barbera created Peter Potamus.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>hippopotamus</b> inhabits rivers, {{lakes and}} {{mangrove}} swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The <b>hippopotamus</b> is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Malagasy <b>hippopotamus</b> is extensive. At least seven <b>hippopotamus</b> bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, {{suggesting}} that they survived until humans arrived on Madagascar. The evidence of humans butchering the hippos also suggests their extinction may have been, in part, due to humans. Despite the discovery of many fossils, the hippos of Madagascar are not very well studied, perhaps because researchers are interested {{in some of the}} more exotic megafauna of Madagascar, such as the giant lemurs and the elephant birds.|$|E

40|$|Hepatic and renal {{concentrations}} {{of the elements}} arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium and zinc were studied in samples collected from <b>hippopotami</b> from the Kafue River in the Kafue National Park and the Luangwa River in the Southern Luangwa National Park in Zambia. There {{were no significant differences}} between trace element concentrations in the tissues of the <b>hippopotami</b> taken in the Kafue River and the Luangwa River. The {{concentrations of}} copper and other essential elements were similar to those reported in normal domestic and wild ruminants. Judging by the results obtained in this study, pollution from the mining activity around the Kafue River drainage area in the Copperbelt region has not led to any accumulation of elements in tissues of the <b>hippopotami</b> in the Kafue National Park.
