The fluid was removed from the reactor in the middle and into the micro <b>electrolysis</b> <b>reactor</b> from the bottom. The volume ratio of solution to fillers was 1 : 1. Because of the high salinity, the raw wastewater worked as an electrolyte and promoted micro electrolysis (Tao and Kang 2014). After a certain time of mixing and reaction, the pH value was regulated to 8 with NaOH. After sedimentation, the hydroxide precipitation was separated from the reaction system, and the supernatant overflowed into the up-flow and down-flow of the first interlayer in acidification reactor alternately at a HRT of 1 – 6  h. The methane reactor was between the two interlayers. And the second interlayer had a similar running mode with the first one at a HRT of 12 – 48  h. The inclined tube was in the up-flow area.|$|E

The results of the simulation will be compared to experimental results from tests done on a lab-scale reactor. A good correlation between reality and the simulacrum would mean engineers and designers can interrogate the inner operation of said reactors safely, effortlessly and economically. This contribution reports a time-dependent simulation of a fluorine-producing <b>electrolysis</b> <b>reactor.</b> COMSOL Multiphysics was used as a tool to construct a two dimensional model where the charge-, heat-, mass- and momentum transfer were fully coupled in one transient simulation. COMSOL is a finite element analysis software package. It enables the user to specify the dimensions of his/her investigation and specify a set of partial differential equations, boundary conditions and starting values. These equations can be coupled to ensure that the complex interaction between the various physical phenomena can be taken into account - an absolute necessity in a model as complex as this one. Results produced include a set of time dependent graphics where the charge-, heat-, mass- and momentum transfer inside the reactor and their development can be visualized clearly. The average liquid velocity in the reactor was also simulated and it was found that this value stabilises after around 90 s. The results of each transfer module are also shown at 100 s, where it is assumed that the simulation has achieved a quasi-steady state. The reactor, on which the model is based, is currently under construction and will be operated under the same conditions as specified in the model. The reactor, constructed of stainless steel, has a transparent side window through which both electrodes can clearly be seen. Thus the bubble formation and flow in the reactor can be studied effectively. Temperature will be measured with a set of thermocouples imbedded in PTFE throughout the reactor. The electric field will similarly be measured using electric induction probes. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{production}} rate (MPR) in {{waste activated sludge}} (WAS) digestion processes is typically limited by the initial steps of complex organic matter degradation, leading to a limited MPR due to sludge fermentation speed of solid particles. In this study, a novel microbial <b>electrolysis</b> AD <b>reactor</b> (ME-AD) was used to accelerate methane production for energy recovery from WAS. Carbon bioconversion was accelerated by ME producing H- 2 at the cathode. MPR was enhanced to 91. 8 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in the microbial <b>electrolysis</b> ME-AD <b>reactor,</b> thus improving the rate by 3 times compared to control conditions (30. 6 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in AD). The methane production yield reached 116. 2 mg/g VSS in the ME-AD reactor. According to balance calculation on electron transfer and methane yield, the increased methane production was mostly dependent on electron contribution through the ME system. Thus, {{the use of the}} novel ME-AD reactor allowed to significantly enhance carbon degradation and methane production from WAS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{processes}} andmechanisms {{of community}} assembly and its relationships to community functioning are central issues in ecology. Both deterministic and stochastic factors play {{important roles in}} shaping community composition and struc-ture, but the connection between community assembly and ecosystem functioning remains elusive, especially in microbial com-munities. Here, we used microbial <b>electrolysis</b> cell <b>reactors</b> as a model system to examine the roles of stochastic assembly in de-termining microbial community structure and functions. Under identical environmental conditions with the same source community, ecological drift (i. e., initial stochastic colonization) and subsequent biotic interactions created dramatically differ-ent communities with little overlap among 14 identical reactors, indicating that stochastic assembly played dominant roles in determining microbial community structure. Neutral community modeling analysis revealed that deterministic factors also played significant roles in shaping microbial community structure in these reactors. Most importantly, the newly formed com-munities differed substantially in community functions (e. g., H 2 production), which showed strong linkages to community structure. This study {{is the first to}} demonstrate that stochastic assembly plays a dominant role in determining not only commu-nity structure but also ecosystem functions. Elucidating the links among community assembly, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning is critical to understanding ecosystem functioning, biodiversity preservation, and ecosystemmanagement.

40|$|Background. The Marilao, Meycauayan and Obando river system (MMORS), in the Philippines {{is home to}} many {{precious}} metals refineries, where local artisanal gold smelting industries use silver to draw gold out of used jewelry. Copper recovers the silver. The copper-rich wastewater contributes to local pollution. Alternative methods for silver recovery include electrolytic recovery: removal of silver ions from solution, and conversion of the ions into metallic silver. Objectives. Explore operation and scale-up for the electrolytic recovery of silver for small-to-medium-scale used gold smelting plants. Methods. Effects of current and time were investigated in a laboratory scale, magnetically-stirred <b>electrolysis</b> <b>reactor,</b> using a sintered platinum anode and a stainless steel cathode. Silver recovery (the removal of silver ions from solution) was evaluated {{at different levels of}} constant operating current, and data was used to determine charge dose as the scale up and operating factor. Charge dose was then used to obtain the operating conditions on a pilot scale (100 L) system. A preliminary pilot test assessed silver recovery performance. Results. Higher silver removal rates were noted at higher operating currents. Electrodeposition at 9 amperes showed 98. 7 % silver recovery after 30 mins. The charge dose for silver electrodeposition was 1. 23 coulombs/mg silver ions removed, while the average electrolysis energy requirement was about 0. 59 kilowatt hours/kg of silver removed. Conclusions. Preliminary comparisons on a 100 -liter scale, showed the electrolytic process had a higher silver removal (~ 90 %) compared to copper displacement (~ 65 %). Results are useful for the process design of a complete field test system. Competing Interests. The authors declare no competing financial interests...|$|E

In <b>reactor</b> with single compartment, high voltage results high current then cause high-energy consumption. The highest chlorine gas production is at 0. 5 M and 300 V that results 4. 63 mmol within 15 minutes.

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} in CO[subscript 2] air capture, high temperature electrolysis, microchannel catalytic conversion, and Generation IV reactor plant systems {{have the potential}} to create a shipboard liquid fuel production system that will ease the burdened cost of supplying fuel to deployed naval ships and aircraft. Based upon historical data provided by the US Navy (USN), the tanker ship must supply 6, 400 BBL/Day of fuel (JP- 5) to accommodate the highest anticipated demand of a carrier strike group (CSG). Previous investigation suggested implementing shipboard a liquid fuel production system using commercially mature processes such as alkaline <b>electrolysis,</b> pressurized water <b>reactors</b> (PWRs), and methanol synthesis; however, more detailed analysis shows that such an approach is not practical. Although Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthetic fuel production technology has traditionally been designed to accommodate large economies of scale, recent advances in modular, microchannel reactor (MCR) technology have to potential to facilitate a shipboard solution. Recent advances in high temperature coelectrolysis (HTCE) and high temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) from solid oxide electrolytic cells (SOECs) have been even more promising. In addition to dramatically reducing the required equipment footprint, HTCE/HTSE produces the desired synthesis gas (syngas) feed at 75 % of the power level required by conventional alkaline electrolysis (590 MW[subscript e] vs. 789 MW[subscript e]). After performing an assessment of various CO[subscript 2] feedstock sources, atmospheric CO[subscript 2] extraction using an air capture system appears the most promising option. However, it was determined that the current air capture system design requires improvement. In order to be feasible for shipboard use, it must be able to capture CO[subscript 2] in a system only ¼ of the present size; and the current design must be modified to permit more effective operation in a humid, offshore environment. Although a PWR power plant is not the recommended option, it is feasible. Operating with a Rankine cycle, a PWR could power the recommended liquid fuel production plant with a 2, 082 MW[superscript th] reactor and 33 % cycle efficiency. The recommended option uses a molten salt-cooled advanced high temperature reactor (AHTR) coupled to a supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO[subscript 2]) recompression cycle operating at 25. 0 MPa and 670 °C. This more advanced 1, 456 MWth option has a 45 % cycle efficiency, a 42 % improvement over the PWR option. In terms of reactor power heat input to JP- 5 combustion heat output, the AHTR is clearly superior to the PWR (31 % vs. 22 %). In order to be a viable concept, additional research and development is necessary to develop more compact CO[subscript 2] capture systems, resolve SOEC degradation issues, and determine a suitable material for the molten salt/S-CO[subscript 2] heat exchanger interface...|$|R
