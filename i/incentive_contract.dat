5000|$|Having {{demonstrated}} that the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> in a dynamic principal-agent problem will be linear in certain environments, Holmstrom and Milgrom then used linear contracts to explore in more detail what happens when agents allocate their efforts or attention across multiple tasks. Prior to 1991, models had generally considered effort on a single task. To reward performance on a single task, a principal can either reward performance (or some measure of it) or change the agent's opportunity cost of performing that task. This second strategy is key to understanding what happens when an agent {{has more than one}} task to which he can allocate effort, because increasing the reward on one task will generally alter the agent's opportunity cost of allocating effort to other tasks, increasing it when the tasks are substitutes for the agent and decreasing it when the tasks are complements. Holmstrom and Milgrom's (1991) paper demonstrates that when tasks are substitutes for the agent {{and it is difficult to}} measure performance on one of them, it may be optimal to have low-powered incentives, or even no incentives, on all tasks, even if some can be easily measured. They also {{demonstrated that}} the difficulties of providing incentives on multiple tasks have implications for the design of jobs. For instance, it may be better to split conflicting tasks between agents or to vary the intensity of monitoring and communication. Finally, in their 1994 paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom broadened the scope of their analysis to include not only performance-related pay but also other management choices that affect agents' incentives, such as choices about how much discretion to give agents and about whether or not agents own the assets with which they work. This paper stressed the interactions (the [...] "complementarities") between these different choices, showing that the optimal choices for the principal will often vary together as the contracting environment changes. Holmstrom recounted the impact of this work at the Nemmers Conference in Honor of Paul Milgrom.|$|E

We analyse a model of vertical differentiation in which we deal with the strategic role of the competitor’s decisions in a successive duopoly.

We determine the equilibrium of a game in which the processors simultaneously decide whether to offer an <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> or to continue at the spot market to acquire their input.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that developing countries and transition economies are increasingly privatising their public firms {{and at the same}} time experiencing rapid growth of inward foreign direct investment (FDI). In an international mixed oligopoly, we analyse the interaction between privatisation and FDI. We show that privatisation increases the incentive for FDI, which in turn, increases the incentive for privatisation compared to the situation of no FDI. The optimal degree of privatisation depends on the cost difference between the public and the foreign firms, and on the foreign firm's mode of entry. We show that our results are robust with respect to the incentive contracts between the owners and the managers. The incentive for FDI and is higher under the <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> than under the no <b>incentive</b> <b>contract,</b> and the optimal degree of privatisation is almost always higher under the <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> than under the no <b>incentive</b> <b>contract.</b> Privatisation; FDI; Welfare; <b>Incentive</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the introduction of}} managerial attention allocation constraints in optimal incentive contracts. There is an agent who provides non-contractible e¤ort {{in a number of}} tasks and a principal who designs a linear <b>incentive</b> <b>contract,</b> composed by a variable and a 8 ̆ 5 xed factor, and monitors the e¤ort of the agent. The framework in Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) is extended to allow the principal to decide the amount of monitoring allocated in each task. More attention allocated to a given task improves the task contractibility due to a decrease in the uncertainty about the e¤ort provided by the agent. The principal allocates the same level of attention and provides the same <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> across tasks under symmetric decreasing returns to scale in production and monitoring.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new {{explanation for the}} dominance of the low-powered <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> over the high-powered <b>incentive</b> <b>contract</b> using a mixed model of moral hazard and adverse selection. We first show that the power of incentives in the second-best contract is lower than that in the first-best contract in the presence of either unobservable risk aversion or cost. We then consider the case that both risk aversion and cost of the agent are unob- servable to the principal. We solve this multidimensional mechanism design problem under two assumptions with regard to the structures of performance measurement system and wage contract. It is shown that if the deterministic and stochastic components of different per- formance measures vary proportionally, the principal is inclined to provide a low-powered <b>incentive</b> <b>contract.</b> Moreover, it is shown that if the base wage depends only on a quadratic function rather than the direction of the performance wage vector, no incentive is provided for most of the performance measures in an orthogonal performance measurement system. ...|$|E
