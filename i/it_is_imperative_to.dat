25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{difficulty of}} studying modern {{history is the}} fact that a plethora of it has been documented up to the present day. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> consider the reliability of the information obtained from these records.|$|E
25|$|Cassini end {{involved}} {{a series of}} close Saturn passes, approaching within the rings, then an entry into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft. This method was chosen because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> ensure protection and prevent biological contamination {{to any of the}} moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.|$|E
25|$|The Letter {{begins by}} Rousseau {{establishing}} the respect {{he has for}} his friend D'Alembert. But after quoting a passage from D'Alembert's letter, Rousseau writes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> discuss the potential disasters that a theatre could bring. He also responds to some comments D'Alembert makes praising the tolerance of the Geneva clergy while criticizing the intolerance of French Roman Catholicism. Rousseau is, however, reluctant to engage this discussion in depth.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{disasters}} are {{a dramatic}} example {{of people living}} in conflict with the environment. Early predictions and warnings are essential for the reduction of property damage and loss of life. Because landslides occur frequently and can represent some of the most destructive forces on earth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> have a good understanding as to what causes them and how people can either help prevent them from occurring or simply avoid them when they do occur. Sustainable land management and development is also an essential key to reducing the negative impacts felt by landslides.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best {{way to do this is}} to slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E
25|$|The violin {{pattern is}} not diagnostic, as other spiders can have similar {{markings}} (e.g. cellar spiders and pirate spiders). For definitive identification <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> examine the eyes. While most spiders have eight eyes, recluse spiders have six eyes {{arranged in pairs}} (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs. Only a few other spiders have three pairs of eyes arranged in this way (e.g., scytodids). Recluses have no obvious coloration patterns on the abdomen or legs, and the legs lack spines. The abdomen is covered with fine short hairs that, when viewed without magnification, {{give the appearance of}} soft fur. The leg joints may appear to be a slightly lighter color.|$|E

25|$|The {{expanding}} {{trawl fisheries}} devastated the Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) populations in Patagonia. Trawl fisheries greatly expanded {{for twenty years}} until they crashed in 1997. Pelagic squid fisheries took over which use pelagic trawls that are harmful to dusky, short-beaked common dolphins, and Commerson’s dolphins. There are approximately 21,000 Commerson’s dolphins remaining today. Two stocks {{have been identified in}} the population but genetic information and bycatch levels are unknown. With anchovy fisheries expanding, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> assess the Commerson’s dolphin population before these fisheries grow. The seasonal operation of in-shore gillnet fisheries are known to involve bycatch of cetaceans. Presently, there are no known estimates of gillnet bycatch. The bycatch problem in Argentina is political in nature. Improvements in fishing technology, awareness, and a large scale survey of Commerson’s dolphin populations and the impact of bycatch is essential.|$|E
25|$|In {{discussing}} {{the evolution of}} S. mutans, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> include the role humans have played and the co-evolution that has occurred between the two species. As humans evolved anthropologically, the bacteria evolved biologically. It is widely accepted that the advent of agriculture in early human populations provided the conditions S. mutans needed to evolve into the virulent bacteria it is today. Agriculture introduced fermented foods, {{as well as more}} carbohydrate rich foods, into the diets of historic human populations. These new foods introduced new bacteria to the oral cavity and created new environmental conditions. For example, Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc are typically found in foods such as yogurt and wine. Also, consuming more carbohydrates increased the amount of sugars available to S. mutans for metabolism and lowered the pH of the oral cavity. This new acidic habitat would select for those bacteria that could survive and reproduce at a lower pH.|$|E
25|$|There is, moreover, {{significant}} political complexity to be treated, {{more than enough}} to complicate any consideration of individual culpability: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> note that some Social Democrats viewed the National Socialists {{as an alternative to the}} Christian Social Party and later Vaterländische Front in the context of reunification with Germany; for example, Karl Renner, a chancellor who served in both the First (1919–33) and Second (post-1945) Austrian Republics, favored a German Anschluss as an alternative to the then Austrofascist regime, under which Berg, Webern, and the Social Democrats suffered. And Webern's professional circle in Vienna included, besides many Jews, many Social Democrats; for example, for David Josef Bach, a close friend of Schoenberg's as well, Webern conducted many workers' and amateur ensembles. Under the Nazis, some Social Democrats expected, there might be more work and protections for workers and laborers, as well as other social reforms and political stability, if not democracy; Webern may well have hoped to again be able to conduct and to be better able to secure a future for his family.|$|E

25|$|The {{progress}} of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired {{in the course of}} their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} this problem, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> apply antiseptics at once. Hydrogen peroxide (a near-universal toxin) {{is not recommended}} for this task as it increases inflammation and impedes healing. [...] Dressings with cadexomer iodine, silver, or honey {{have been shown to}} penetrate bacterial biofilms. Systemic antibiotics are not recommended in treating local infection in a pressure ulcer, as it can lead to bacterial resistance. They are only recommended if there is evidence of advancing cellulitis, bony infection, or bacteria in the blood.|$|E

The first figurative coffins used to bury the traditional chiefs, were therefore not a new invented art form but only the copies of the figurative palanquins.|$|R
50|$|In Venice, Adhnames {{were also}} used to {{maintain}} political and commercial links with the Ottoman Empire. This agreement between Venice and the Ottoman Empire ensured that Italian merchants were protected during their commerce trips into the Empire.

In efforts to maintain the integrity and tradition of the practice, Sharath continues to travel and teach worldwide.|$|R
2500|$|The {{intention}} {{behind the}} amendments {{has long been}} called into question. The Akritas plan, written in {{the height of the}} constitutional dispute by the Greek Cypriot interior minister Policarpos Yorgadjis, called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating “In the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, because if we succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.” Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards enosis had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as [...] "a step on the road to enosis". Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing taksim (partition) the best safeguard against enosis.|$|E
2500|$|The 1961 Constitution {{provided}} the backbone for the Independence Constitution. A date {{was provided to}} guarantee this legal continuity. An indispensable characteristic of this constitution is the substitution of the diarchic system, which was no longer practicable, by system of only one Government, the Government of Malta, with full legislative and executive powers. At that time Malta was still a colony and responsibility for defence and external affairs were referred to Her Majesty’s Government. There was a clear indication that the road towards independence continued and now was at a highly developed stage. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> recognise that the 1961 Constitution established most {{of the features of}} the 1964 Constitution. The British recognised Malta as a State. Another important characteristic of this constitution was an innovative introduction of a chapter covering the safeguarding of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual. This is fairly significant because Fundamental Human Rights are a protection for the individual by the State. In the 1961 Constitution, Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms are found in Chapter IV. The protection of freedom of movement was introduced only in the 1964 Constitution.|$|E
60|$|It needs {{scarcely}} be observed, {{that general}} propositions of {{which no one}} can tell exactly what they assert, can not possibly have been brought to the test of a correct induction. Whether a name is to be used as an instrument of thinking, or as a means of communicating the result of thought, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> determine exactly the attribute or attributes which it is to express; to give it, in short, a fixed and ascertained connotation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1900, King Alexander {{suddenly}} announced his engagement to the widowed Madame Draga Mašin, formerly a lady-in-waiting {{to his mother and}} 12 years older than him. The proposed union aroused great opposition: not only was Draga of unequal birth and obscure family, but at 36 years of age, the chances of her bearing an heir were slim. Alexander was an only child, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> secure the succession.|$|R
60|$|That {{experience}} {{was but a}} forerunner to others just like it. Every day we sighted one or more swordfish. But we could not get one to take hold. Captain Dan said there was more chance of getting a strike from a swordfish that was not visible rolling on the surface. Now a flying-fish bait makes a rather heavy bait to troll; and as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> have the reel free running and held lightly with the thumb, {{after a few hours}} such trolling becomes hard work. Hard as it was, it did not wear on me like the strain of being always ready for a strike. I doubt if any fisherman could stand this strain.|$|E
60|$|I {{just had}} a talk with a fellow who claims to know {{a good deal about}} bonefishing. He said he had caught a good many ranging up to eight pounds. His claim was that soldier crabs were the best bait. He said he had fished with {{professional}} boatmen who knew the game thoroughly. They would pole the skiff alongshore and keep a sharp lookout for what he called bonefish mud. And I assume that he meant muddy places in the water that had been stirred up by bonefish. Of course, any place where these little swirls could be seen was very likely to be a bonefish bank. He claimed that it was necessary to hold the line near the reel between the forefingers, and to feel for the very slightest vibration. Bonefish have a sucker-like mouth. They draw the bait in, and smash it. Sometimes, of course, they move away, drawing out the line, but that kind of a bite is exceptional. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> strike the fish when this vibration is felt. Not one in five bonefish is hooked.|$|E
