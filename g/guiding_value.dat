60|$|This is one man's proposal, {{his attempt}} to supply a need that has oppressed him for many years, a need {{that he has not}} only found in his own schemes of conduct, but that he has {{observed}} in the thought of numberless people about him, rendering their action fragmentary, wasteful in the gross, and ineffective in the net result, the need for some general principle, some leading idea, some standard, sufficiently comprehensive to be of real <b>guiding</b> <b>value</b> in social and political matters, in many doubtful issues of private conduct, and throughout the business of dealing with one's fellow-men. No doubt there are many who do not feel such a need at all, and with these we may part company forthwith; there are, for example, those who profess the artistic temperament and follow the impulse of the moment, and those who consult an inner light in some entirely mystical manner. But neither of these I believe is the most abundant type in the English-speaking communities. My impression is that with most of the minds I have been able to examine with any thoroughness, the attempt to systematize one's private and public conduct alike, and to reduce it to spacious general rules, to attempt, if not to succeed, in making it coherent, consistent, and uniformly directed, is an almost instinctive proceeding.|$|E

In 1989 several summer smog episodes occurred which contributed to exceedence of Dutch air quality limit values for NO 2 on a few stations. However exceedence of the Dutch draft limit values for O 3 were not detected. At a few stations the limit values for black smoke were exceeded and at one station the maximal allowable hour value was exceeded once caused by an incidental polluting activity. <b>Guide</b> <b>values</b> for SO 2 and NO 2 were exceeded at 6 % and 80 % resp. {{of the total number}} of stations.

Reflecting the now longstanding call for student affairs and academic affairs professionals to unite in service of facilitating student development and learning, the authors propose a set of <b>guiding</b> <b>values</b> for student affairs administrators that promote data- and theory-based intentionality of practice.

40|$|Though {{creativity}} is usually defined as “novel and ap-propriate, ” {{this is most}} often understood to mean “as novel as possible, so long as appropriate. ” While this definition might be suitably applied to finished prod-ucts, it is less obviously useful as a <b>guiding</b> <b>value</b> during the act of creation. This research tests this and other def-initions by using computer simulations based on Camp-bell’s “blind variation and selective retention ” theory. Introducing a “temperature ” parameter to reduce nov-elty’s importance over time produces results superior to both an even combination of novelty and appropri-ateness and the prevailing “novel, so long as appropri-ate ” definition.

40|$|Abstract: In our {{paper we}} try to answer two {{empirical}} research questions. First, we assess the deliberative quality of discussions in two committees of the EU Parliament. In order to do so, we use a slightly revised version of the DQI. Second, we identify and empirically measure those variables that systematically influence the quality of deliberation in interviews with debate actors. We argue {{that the quality of}} deliberation in EU committees is influenced by two normative values: deliberation (common good orientation) and responsiveness (particular interest orientation), with the <b>guiding</b> <b>value</b> determined by the particular situation. Using a multidimensional concept of deliberation, we empirically test the impact of situational variables on specific aspects of deliberative quality. In addition, we take into account the temporal dimension of deliberation...|$|E

The novel method extends Qing-Zhou approach based on logic reasoning by adding a simple time expression and analysis method.

An anonymous electronic cash payment protocol is analyzed by the novel logic, and the result shows that the fairness of the protocol is not satisfied due to the timeliness problem in protocol.

Next, simulate the running of the improved program, the results of which show that the improved program can remove the existing bottlenecks in the production logistics system. As a result, not only is the utilization of resources and equipment improved, but also production plans can be smoothly carried out.
