5|$|Clock Tower (1995) is {{the first}} entry in the series and was {{released}} exclusively in Japan. It was directed by Hifumi Kono and originally released for the Super Famicom. An updated version, titled Clock Tower: The First Fear, was ported to the PlayStation, WonderSwan, and Windows. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, although fan translations exist. The story follows Jennifer Simpson, a young girl searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of a mansion in Norway while evading Scissorman.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{fight their}} way through Roman′s men, {{reaching}} an underground chamber where Nate believes the statue is buried. Meanwhile, Eddy, consumed by paranoia, warns Roman that an unearthly force has been killing off his men, which the former dismisses as nonsense. Nate investigates the chamber but not before he gets separated from Sully via a booby-trapped secret doorway. Unfortunately, Nate and Elena, after deciding to carry on without Sully, find not the statue but Drake's corpse, with whom he sadly leaves the ring (believing he never found the sarcophagus). A group of zombie-like creatures swarm him and his companions, including Eddy and his bodyguard. In the chaos that follows, Eddy and his man are killed. Nate and Elena press on and find themselves in an old Nazi submarine base built into the island. Looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> Nate finds a letter written by Drake exposing the truth: El Dorado is protected by a curse that turned both the Spanish colonists and the German soldiers into monsters. Drake sought to destroy it, but the creatures killed him before he could; a picture reveals that Drake's corpse {{was in front of}} the statue before it was moved by the Germans.|$|E

40|$|Poverty, {{a social}} scourge that every {{developing}} nation {{is struggling to}} banish. Nearly all the third world nations are still growing under its evil effects. The developed nations are equally looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out,</b> <b>for</b> the developing nation. One of the <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of these problem is the introduction and embracement of Millennium development goal which was strategically designed to reduce the scourge of poverty {{and to ensure that}} poverty becomes {{a thing of the past}} in our society. And how education can be used as <b>a</b> tool <b>for</b> national development. This paper also looked at the role of social studies towards the realization of the Millennium development goal and also suggested what can be done to enhance its realization in the third world nations...|$|R
25|$|Initially, most Tennesseans {{showed little}} enthusiasm for {{breaking}} {{away from a}} nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. In 1860, they had voted by a slim margin for the Constitutional Unionist John Bell, a native son and moderate who continued to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the crisis.|$|E
25|$|French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud {{dismissed}} his supreme military commander, Maurice Gamelin, {{and replaced}} {{him with the}} 73-year old Maxime Weygand. He also named the 84-year-old Philippe Pétain, a hero of the First World War, as deputy prime minister. Neither Weygand nor Pétain felt the Germans could be defeated, and they began looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the crisis, a worldwide move toward Keynesian deficit financing and general resurgence of Keynesian policies resulted in a new economic consensus, which involved reassessment or even reversal of normative judgments on a number of topics. The Keynesian view receiving most attention has been fiscal stimulus, applied by numerous states {{as a response to the}} Great Recession. The IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn advocated for global fiscal stimulus already in January 2008.|$|E

40|$|Obstacles to obtaining binding {{determinations}} of domicile often {{block the}} personal jurisdiction required <b>for</b> alimony adjudication. <b>A</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the impasse, Professor Ritz argues, {{is offered by}} the mechanism of removing cases to federal courts under the constitutional grant of federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship...|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the {{derelict}} Caux Palace Hotel {{as well as}} {{the former}} Grand Hotel and other smaller hotel buildings in Caux looked like near their end. The bankrupt Société Immobilière de Caux had fallen into the hands of its main banker, Banque populaire de Montreux, who were looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>way</b> <b>out</b> and had put the whole lot on the market at a very low price. The most likely outcome was the demolition of the building in order to reuse its material.|$|R
25|$|However {{the party}} itself argues that its {{earliest}} publications show {{they have remained}} consistent in their search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of an impasse in Northern Ireland that satisfies nationalist desires and calms unionist fears. The SDLP {{were the first to}} advocate the so-called principle of consent — recognising that fundamental changes in Northern Ireland's constitutional status could only come with the agreement {{of the majority of the}} people of Northern Ireland. However, the SDLP has always been clear that this should not mean that anybody should have a veto on change or equality.|$|E
25|$|Most Tennesseans {{initially}} {{showed little}} enthusiasm for breaking {{away from a}} nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. There were small exceptions such as Franklin County, which borders Alabama in southern Middle Tennessee; Franklin County formally threatened to secede from Tennessee and join Alabama if Tennessee did not leave the Union. Franklin County withdrew this threat when Tennessee did eventually secede. In 1860, Tennesseans had voted by a slim margin for the Constitutional Unionist John Bell, a native son and moderate who continued to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the crisis.|$|E
25|$|The Nixon administration, looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> {{pursued a}} less {{restrained}} course under the brief but devastating Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II bombing raids. These attacks removed {{many of the}} restrictions upon previous American targeting, seeded Northern waters with mines that cut Soviet and Chinese imports to a trickle, exhausted national air-defenses and crippled whatever significant remaining industrial plant and transportation network {{was left in the}} North. LINEBACKER caused more damage to Northern lines of communication, than the previous 3 years of ROLLING THUNDER, particularly as the Easter Offensive brought communist forces out into the open.|$|E
50|$|In 1519 {{another war}} between the Teutonic Order and Poland erupted. A truce was signed in 1521, set to expire in 1525. Over {{the course of the}} next four years, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Albert Hohenzollern in search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} <b>way</b> <b>out</b> before the war resumed, met with several Lutheran theologians, including Andreas Osiander and Luther himself. Luther recommended that Albert convert to Lutheranism and secularize his duchy. By 1523 Albert began promoting the new faith and invited Lutheran intellectuals and theologians to the city.|$|R
50|$|The refusals {{signaled}} war. Uzana ultimately backed down, {{and looked}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> face-saving <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> The king {{handed over the}} power to Gov. Sithu of Myinsaing, uncle and father-in-law of Kyawswa, on 1 September 1340, and became a monk at Mekkhaya. Father-in-law or not, Kyawswa apparently did not recognize Sithu either. According to an inscription donated on 17 June 1342 by Kyawswa's chief queen consort Atula Sanda Dewi, Kyawswa had already claimed himself king. A contemporary inscription shows that Kyawswa became the undisputed ruler of Pinya on 29 March 1344.|$|R
25|$|Backed by low dunes, {{the top of}} {{the beach}} {{comprises}} about 80m of dry, very loose sand, making it very popular with families. Lower down it is hard-packed.

25|$|In 2011, Thanwarin Sukhaphisit's Insects in the Backyard, a movie {{depicting}} {{the struggles of}} a family in which a transgender teenage son and daughter's lives are tormented {{by a lack of}} communication and an inability to communicate with their biological father {{to the point that they}} end up selling their bodies looking, very much in vain, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of their own lives, became the first film to receive the Haw Heep rating, which banned the distribution and showing of the film. There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Secretary Bard was {{convinced}} that a standard bombardment and naval blockade {{would be enough to}} force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the series}} was indeed {{proving to be a}} hit, its late time slot in the country's largest media market began to concern its distributor. Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much choice in the matter. At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning of primetime. Each one of those slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was not going anywhere (especially considering NBC's New York base was about to become its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E
5000|$|Conflicts in {{communication}} are common and often we ask [...] "What do you mean?" [...] or seek clarification in other ways. This is called meta-communication: communication about the communication. Sometimes, asking for clarification is impossible.

5000|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "southern route" [...] of the South Pennsylvania was a treacherous one, as {{it crossed}} six mountain ridges, required nine tunnels, and involved numerous curves and steep grades. Construction continued into 1885 with considerable {{work done in}} drilling the tunnels and grading {{the portion of the}} route through the mountains. But as expenses rose, Vanderbilt began to have second thoughts and began looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> graceful <b>way</b> <b>out</b> that would protect the investments made by his syndicate partners.

500|$|In San Diego, Theresa Scher, a {{stripper}} and call girl, was looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> {{of the sex}} industry when she watched a CNN interview with Albee about her work with JC's Girls in Riverside. Scher contacted Albee, who allowed Scher {{to establish a new}} chapter of JC's Girls in San Diego. Scher founded the chapter in 2007 with Sheri Brown, a former social worker. Brown had previously hated strippers, but, once she had accepted a job helping teenage mothers finish high school and the first four teens she worked with were strippers, she said that she developed [...] "an overwhelming passion to reach out to these precious women in love and without condemnation." [...] She has described being sexually abused as a child and later being a teenage mother; Brown found that both of these experiences helped her to relate to strippers, as many of the strippers she encountered also had those experiences.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of this confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E
500|$|With England unseeded, Revie {{was handed}} opponents for {{qualifying}} for the 1978 World Cup of Italy, Finland and Luxembourg. Only the winner would progress to the finals. Just before the campaign began England suffered a 2-1 defeat to Scotland to finish {{second in the}} 1975–76 British Home Championship. England made heavy work of both Finland and Luxembourg, winning 4–1 away and 2–1 at home against the Finns and 5–0 at home and 2–0 away against the Luxembourgers. The failure to inflict heavier defeats on these sides was ultimately the reason why Italy qualified for the finals on goal difference alone. [...] England fell to a 2–0 defeat in Rome where Revie was criticised for his previously untested back four selection of Emlyn Hughes, Dave Clement, Roy McFarland, and Mick Mills; he also played Trevor Brooking out of position and surprised many by selecting Stan Bowles ahead of Stuart Pearson. Sensing that he was disliked by FA chairman Sir Harold Thompson, and with further criticism coming his way after England could only finish third in the 1976–77 British Home Championship, Revie began to look <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> He missed a friendly with Brazil in Rio de Janeiro for what he claimed was a scouting assignment on the Italians, when in fact he had travelled to Dubai for contract negotiations with the United Arab Emirates. Revie asked for his contract with England to be cancelled, which the FA refused to do and the FA offered Revie their full support despite having already approached Bobby Robson to replace him. The game with Brazil ended in a 0–0 draw, and their tour of South America concluded with draws with Argentina and Uruguay. On 12 July 1977, Revie revealed in an exclusive to the Daily Mail that he was quitting the England job to become manager of the UAE. The FA suspended Revie from football for ten years {{on a charge of}} bringing the game into disrepute; Revie contested his suspension in a lawsuit against the FA, and the court overturned the suspension after ruling that the FA had overreached its powers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immediate}} aftermath of the incident was bedlam. Tyson was disqualified and a melee ensued.

[...] In his {{interpretation}} of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained [...] "Gil sings of 'looking for a way out' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he’s {{too far away from}} home, there is no way out—instead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar." [...] Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the [...] "river" [...] to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently says [...] "Africa".|$|E
5000|$|By March 1968 Johnson was {{secretly}} desperate <b>for</b> <b>an</b> honorable <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the war.

He decided to restrict future bombing {{with the result that}} 90 percent of North Vietnam's population and 75 percent of its territory was off-limits to bombing. On March 25, after being briefed by officials at the State Department, the Pentagon and the CIA, the Wise Men meet once more with the president. This time they advised against any further troop increases and recommended that the administration seek a negotiated peace.
