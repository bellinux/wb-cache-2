Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|The Romans, however, {{managed to}} stop further Islamic {{expansion}} into their lands during the 8th century and, {{beginning in the}} 9th century, reclaimed parts of the conquered lands. In 1000AD, the Eastern Empire was at its height: Basil II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. However, soon after, the expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert. The aftermath of this important battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline. Two decades of internal strife and Turkic invasions ultimately {{paved the way for}} Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to send a call <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> the Western European kingdoms in 1095.|$|E

5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{never again}} went on crusade {{after his return}} to England in 1274, but he {{maintained}} an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287. This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by {{the conflict between the}} French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy, and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> Peter of Aragon, in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese. The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release. As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is {{planning}} to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he now is a Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> reach the Varden. Jeod decides {{to go with them}} and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{issued an}} appeal <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> his barons, and Henry {{was the first}} to arrive in Rouen in November. Violence broke out, leading to savage, {{confused}} street fighting as both sides attempted {{to take control of the}} city. Robert and Henry left the castle to join the battle, but Robert then retreated, leaving Henry to continue the fighting. The battle turned in favour of the ducal forces and Henry took Conan prisoner. Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, threw him off the top of the castle to his death. Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, and Henry became famous for his exploits in the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} well {{received}} among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg {{was in his}} camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal {{an end to the}} war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending contragulatory messages, send no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and was alone in allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to worry about the Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors who had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Krujë.|$|E
