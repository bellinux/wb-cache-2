40|$|This Article uses {{canons of}} {{construction}} to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualism, particularly plain language or plain meaning textualism, cannot be applied {{without the use}} of non-textual personal choices. But, this Article does not seek to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> interpreting the Constitution requires ignoring the text of the Constitution; nor does this Article seek to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualist approaches lack relevance or value. Rather, this Article seeks to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualism cannot create rules that avoid personal predilections and does not create neutral principles or eliminate predilective interpretation. In order to accomplish this goal, this Article reviews a variety of canons of construction and applies them to the Takings Clause...|$|R

5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> Hsp 70 is {{released}} in the extracellular space under normal cell culture conditions, and this release is mediated through exosomes. We have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 cells, a clone of mouse mesoangioblasts, produce and release in the extracellular space membrane vesicles, independently of culture growth conditions. These vesicles contains both structural proteins and biological active molecules, such as FGF- 2 and the metalloproteinases MMP 2 and 9. We have also <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles contain HspP 70 and its release is highly regulated. Some of the intracellular Hsp 70 is localized on lipid rafts and its concentration in insoluble fraction increases after heat shock. Vesicle shedding is influenced by lipid raft integrity, but not so Hsp 70 release. Recent experiments have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles also contain urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA), both responsible of plasmin activation. These two proteins could be responsible for MMP activation, as reported in other cell lines. Recently {{it has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> MMP 9 expression depends on Hsp 70, through NF-kB and AP 1 activation. Our preliminary data <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> NM 3 cells, a clone with a 55...|$|R

5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|Halfway through Gather Together, an {{incident}} occurs that demonstrates {{the different ways}} in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism. Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior was dangerous. Rita's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life, and Angelou <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E

5|$|In Series 1, Episode 6, Rachel reveals to Karen {{that she}} is pregnant, but is unsure whether the father is Adam or Kris, whom she had sex with {{while he was in}} Manchester. She devastates Adam by first turning down his {{proposal}} of marriage, after he believes he is the father of the child, and then by leaving Manchester on a train. Adam arrives at the station shortly before her train leaves and pledges to love the child regardless of who its father is. Rachel <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> he does not mean it, and the train departs for London.|$|E

Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> the monks {{were part of the}} mainstream of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} <b>demonstrates</b> <b>that</b> the continents of the Earth are {{moving across the}} surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
