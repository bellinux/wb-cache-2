40|$|INTRODUCTION Renal {{scarring}} is {{the most}} common cause of arterial hypertension in children. High blood pressure (BP) and microalbuminuria contribute to the progression of chronic renal disease. OBJECTIVE The aims of the study were: to assess BP in children with renal scarring by continuous ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in comparison to the casual method (CBP), and to determine the correlation between ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and/or casual blood pressure (CBP) values and proteinuria in children with renal scarring. METHOD This <b>forward-looking</b> <b>study</b> comprised thirty-five children (26 girls and 9 boys), aged between 3 - 13 years, 10. 4 ± 3. 9, X+SD. Blood pressure was measured using the casual method (CBP) with a mercury manometer; BP was measured three times and the average was taken as a referent value. ABPM was performed using the oscillometric method with the Space Labs device, model 90207. RESULTS 45. 71 % of patients were classified as hypertensive by ABPM, while only 22. 6 % of CBP measurements were above the 95 th percentile (p< 0. 01). "White coat hypertension" was present in 40 % of the patients. Non-dipping BP alteration was detected in 37. 14 % of the patients. CONCLUSION Nocturnal systolic hypertension (systolic non-dipping alteration) is very frequent in children with renal scarring. Nocturnal diastolic blood pressure, detectable only via ABPM, is positively correlated with proteinuria and may be an initial sign of the progression of renal scarring. ABPM is more sensitive than CBP in the evaluation of BP in children with renal scarring...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePain mobilizes {{numerous}} psychological variables,which {{involve the}} interaction of cognitions (attention, interpretation of the situation), feelings (fear, anger, anxiety) and behaviors (immobilization, avoidance). These various aspects generally have an adaptive role, necessary {{for the conservation of}} the body. However, in chronic pain, these mechanisms can become dysfunctional and cannot answer their initial function, and can even influence the appearance of psychopathologies. In this framework, feelings and emotional processing {{play an important role in}} the modulation of the intensity of sensory and emotional aspects of pain. In this particular case, suppression, emotional avoidance and alexithymia are associated with a greater intensity of the sensory or emotional aspects of pain. Although recent studies have employed relatively rigorous methodological devices, sometimes they used many tools which do not yet measure the dysfunction directly. Furthermore, emotional suppression was mainly studied during anger, which constitutes a specific phenomenon that cannot be generalized to all emotions. New studies are to be envisaged which would allow in particular the study of the effect of unregulated (insufficient control of experience or emotional expression) and untreated (arousing intrusive thoughts and the obstinacy of the emotional experience) emotions, defined by Baker et al. (2007), and the use of a tool permitting the differentiation and measurement of all possible dysfunctions. They could also allow for the control of the concomitant presence of various emotional dysfunctions in participants. Ideally, the realization of <b>forward-looking</b> <b>studies</b> could define the nature of the links between emotional dysfunctions and chronic pain.

40|$|Mega-events are {{associated}} with significant positive implications such as enhanced international exposure of the host, improved infrastructure, increased tourist numbers, higher employment levels and tax revenues, greater feelings of patriotism among host region residents and integration of the host into the international community. Supporters of events have claimed that the occasions stimulate prominent economic gains for the host region. The economic and tourism growth that occurred in Barcelona following the 1992 Olympic Games is erroneously cited by proponents of hosting {{as an example of}} the potential benefits that an event can derive on the host. Those Games were not the sole driver of growth in the region. An analysis of previous mega-events, demonstrated that net benefits were not a necessary consequence of hosting. Comparison of pre-event estimates of the economic impact and their actual effects are universally divergent. The observation was validated by the consensus academic opinion that economic impact studies systematically overstate the benefits of hosting, and underestimate the costs. Further, different <b>forward-looking</b> <b>studies</b> of the same event, calculate vastly different predictions. The tools for calculating the economic impact, specifically Input-Output Analysis and Computable General Equilibrium, do not provide useful predictions given their dependence on the inaccurate data. With 2010 cost data having continually increased since 2003, determining the appropriate inputs to an I-O or CGE is problematic. It was identified that the weight given to the multiplier effect was also a factor in the amplification of the expected benefits. Given the poor data sets available as inputs to I-O and CGE models, the study concentrated on conducting a comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis of the determinants of the economic impact of the 2010 World Cup based on the premise that the identification of the relative costs and benefits of staging the event was regarded as a greater contribution to the body of knowledge on the topic. It can be expected that there will not be significant short-term economic gains; this study predicted a net cost of R 8. 4 bn, which is marginally offset by short-term net intangible benefits. The short-term economic consequences of the 2010 World Cup are expected to be overshadowed by the long-term effects on revenues within the tourism industry. The image implication of hosting 2010 is the most salient factor in considering the economic impact of 2010, as an alteration in the national image can have long-term effects on FDI and tourism. It is however not a certainty that the international exposure that South Africa receives will be beneficial, in the instance that the World Cup is characterised by poor organisational measures or crime. The net impact of hosting is expected to be a function of the long-term benefits, which can be expected to exceed the short-terms costs, and derive a cumulative net benefit from staging 2010. The World Cup is however unlikely to stimulate the economic growth rate above levels that would have occurred had the event not been held in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} problem of demand estimation across complementary goods {{at the level of}} individual purchase decisions made by consumers. At this micro level, package sizes may restrict the amount of goods that can be purchased, and temporary price discounts may induce consumers to stockpile goods in anticipation of their future consumption needs, leading to dynamics in purchasing behavior over time. We address these issues in two essays by proposing new structural models of demand. In the first essay, we develop a new approach to modeling consumer preferences for complements which is based on household production theory, and we study the importance of accounting for package size restrictions in modeling cross-category price effects. In the second essay, we embed this approach in a model of consumer <b>forward-looking</b> behavior to <b>study</b> the consequences of stockpiling behavior on the spillover effect of prices across complementary products that are storable. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{conventional}} optimal monetary policy framework, two key assumptions underline the full commitment solution : Monetary authority is perfectly credible, and can commit for {{an infinite number}} of periods. Using a baseline <b>forward-looking</b> model, this <b>study</b> explores the implications of relaxing these assumptions in turn. First, finite lasting commitments are introduced using a stochastic exogenous process that generates policy reoptimizations. As a consequence, monetary policy is characterized with a continuum from pure discretion to full commitment. Second, we solve the optimal and robust targeting rules when the central bank confronts imperfect and/or uncertain credibility. Imperfect credibility is defined as {{a situation in which the}} private sector expects the commitment regime to end sooner than that is intended by the policy maker. The results indicate that, under imperfect credibility, optimal policy becomes observationally closer to the discretionary solution, the more being so as the degree of uncertainty rises. These findings may be insightful for explaining the observed near-discretionary behavior of the central banks, which indeed operate under imperfect credibility.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the idea of}} a hybrid bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) formed by a constellation of spaceborne illuminators and receiving-only airborne <b>forward-looking</b> SARs. The <b>study</b> aims at identifying and developing new imaging techniques for avoidance, landing, and observation, able to guarantee forward-looking real-time, all-weather, day and night, high geometric and radiometric resolution images for Unmanned Airborne Systems (UAS). Nowadays, UAS Navigation is mainly performed with satellite navigation systems (e. g. GPS, Galileo) which offer accurate and reliable navigation data, but no information about the surrounding environment. A vision-based navigation system can greatly improve UAS autonomy with an additional beneficial impact on obstacle avoidance capability. SAR systems have been already experienced on-board aircrafts of different classes. However, such sensors have been only used as remote sensing payloads in side-looking geometry. For navigation purposes a forward looking geometry is preferable, but it has been rarely experienced due to major limitations (left/right ambiguity and poor Doppler resolution) which can be only partially mitigated at the cost of strong complexities. These limitations can be overcome by the proposed space airborne bistatic system provided that specific requirements on the acquisition geometry are satisfied. In addition, the airborne receiver can be much more compact and lightweight, with a reduced power request thus complying with typical UAS requirements. Preliminary feasibility assessment and definition of strawman system concept have been conducted under ESA contract (22499 / 09 /F/MOS) considering UAS vision-based navigation as main application even if further uses, e. g. remote sensing or surveillance, have been envisaged...|$|R
40|$|The first {{substantive}} chapter (II) {{addresses the}} macroeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS, {{with reference to}} sub-Saharan Africa. The framework is designed to capture some interactions between the formal and the informal sector, and - reflecting open capital markets of many economies affected by HIV/AIDS - to address the implications of capital mobility. Additionally, our study is the first academic study of the growth impact of scaling up antiretroviral treatment. Allowing for capital mobility, our analysis returns a stronger impact of HIV/AIDS on output and income per capita than the corresponding closed-economy models. The estimated impact on the informal sector is more pronounced than for the formal sector, reflecting a stronger impact of HIV/AIDS on savings rates. GDP per capita is lower in the scenario with comprehensive scaling-up of antiretroviral treatment, as rising costs of care and treatment affect savings rates. Chapter III adapts a microeconomic framework with <b>forward-looking</b> agents to <b>study</b> the contributions of health, as well as income, to living standards, drawing on empirical work {{on the value of}} statistical life. For leading industrialized countries, the contribution of health {{over long periods of time}} has been of similar magnitude as rising incomes, but the contribution of health has slowed down since about 1950. For developing countries, the slowdown occurred somewhat later. HIV/AIDS has resulted in steep declines in living standards in a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Chapter IV focuses on the impact of capital-deepening arising from falling relative prices of ICT equipment. The estimated impact of ICT-related capital deepening on growth in developing countries is substantial (about 0. 3 percentage points), although lower than comparable estimates for leading industrialized countries. Unlike in some industrialized countries, the impact of ICT-related capital deepening has not slowed down after 2000, owing to growing absorption of communications equipment...|$|R
