5|$|Up to six {{eggs are}} laid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> The bushcrow's eggs are cream-colored with pale lilac blotches that {{concentrate}} into a ring at the wider end.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|Formica polyctena, {{among other}} ant species, {{constructs}} nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that {{aids in the}} development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> materials.|$|E
50|$|Black-billed cuckoos {{are known}} to lay their eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other birds. They can lay eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other black-billed cuckoos, called conspecific parasitism, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other songbirds, known as {{interspecific}} parasitism. The females will usually parasitize <b>nests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon because <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> are often unguarded at this time. This cuckoo species {{is thought to have}} a laying interval of about a day so if two eggs show up <b>in</b> a <b>nest</b> on <b>the</b> same day, you can rightfully assume that one is a parasitic egg.|$|R

5|$|No nesting {{material}} {{is used in}} the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> for about 30 days.|$|E
5|$|P. labiata will {{sometimes}} approach a translucent nest containing another spider, and will usually wait facing the prey {{for up to}} several hours. Occasionally P. labiata leaps at the prey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> but this is ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans live {{in social}} nests that are open combed. This leaves nests very {{susceptible}} to attacks by predators and by parasitoids. Attack by parasitoids will occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> brood, as the invader {{will attempt to}} insert its own offspring into the host’s nest. The two most common parasitoids are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis.|$|E

50|$|Tiny nymphs of the species, {{apparently}} first instar, {{have consistently}} been found living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of <b>the</b> ant species Cremastogastor lineloata <b>in</b> Kansas. <b>The</b> ant often lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil beneath large rocks. Adults of the cockroach species {{have not been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests,</b> but <b>the</b> young nymphs are raised among C. lineolata workers without apparent harm.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of Stegodyphus spiders and {{probably}} feed on the fragments of <b>the</b> insects caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> webs. The larvae are dark red. Pupation also takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spiders <b>nest.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> of others {{of their own}} species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.|$|E
5|$|The main {{call of the}} American white ibis is a honking sound, {{transcribed}} as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The call is used in flight, courtship or when disturbed. Birds also utter a muted huu-huu-huu call while foraging, {{and make}} a squealing call in courtship. Young <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> give a high-pitched zziu as a begging call.|$|E
5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} {{and some do}} not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> than those with larger litters.|$|E

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Males {{tend to take}} tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females {{often take}} thrushes and starlings. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die {{immediately}} but succumb during feather plucking and eating. More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including bats, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines and live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> commensally. Unused or abandoned areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E

5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she will remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The altricial, downy chicks hatch after 33days of incubation. After hatching, {{the female}} cares for and feeds the chicks {{for the first}} 8–14days of life, and also during bad weather after that. The male {{provides}} food, up to six kills per day {{in the first week}} increasing to eight per day in the third and 10per day in the last week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> by which time the female is also hunting.|$|E
5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|Tubenoses have smaller egg {{clutches}} {{and much}} {{longer and more}} variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may {{also contribute to the}} lengthy incubation.|$|E
