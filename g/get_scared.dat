25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will <b>get</b> <b>scared</b> {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, it is a sign that the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{moved to}} Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 {{to shoot the}} T. rex attack on the LSX powered SUVs. Shooting proved {{frustrating}} because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic T. rex to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes. On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would <b>get</b> <b>scared</b> and run away. The ripples in the glass of water caused by the T. rexs footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put {{a glass of water}} on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect. Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the Dilophosaurus on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center. Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the T. rex, abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws. The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the T. rex saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a [...] "King Kong roar" [...] while an ironic banner reading [...] "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" [...] flew. The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30, and within days, editor Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming Schindler's List.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Living in the USA, Ronstadt {{conducted}} album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with the Rolling Stones at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, {{in her hometown of}} Tucson, where she and Jagger sang [...] "Tumbling Dice". On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to <b>get</b> <b>scared.</b> He's so silly onstage, he knocks you over. I mean you have to be on your toes or you wind up falling on your face." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bella has {{a sarcastic}} sense of humor, {{especially}} when she gets mad; Bella is almost always a very soft and forgiving person who is hard to anger. She is easily scared but can be surprisingly very brave, able to block painful thoughts and memories (hence her special vampire ability), and tends to come face-to-face with life-threatening danger head-on, even though she can <b>get</b> <b>scared</b> later. She puts Edward before herself and everybody and everything else, but several 'selfish' tendencies emerge (as when she asked Edward {{to stay with her}} instead of fighting vampires in Eclipse). Meyer has stated that Bella's [...] "tragic flaw" [...] in Eclipse is her lack of self-knowledge. This is most obviously illustrated in her consistent denial of any romantic feelings for Jacob Black, {{despite the fact that she}} later realizes that she is, indeed, in love with him.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{positive}} reviews, however. One modern critic said [...] "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects." [...] Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: [...] "As in Deadly Mantis, the complete disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as {{is the notion of}} 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to <b>get</b> <b>scared,</b> or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely <b>get</b> <b>scared</b> every time I get on the stage. I get nervous. I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous because then I don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and trying to put the set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done as far as my tours go." ...|$|E
