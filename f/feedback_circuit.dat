5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit.</b> A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

These circuits endow biological systems with required functional properties. We give an overview on recent research results {{for the analysis of}} <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> in cell-biological systems using methods from control theory. Starting from the known functional roles of <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits,</b> we summarize the biological questions that motivate a control theoretical analysis and perspective. Then, suitable methods for such an analysis are presented. We discuss how to apply these methods to biological research problems by summarizing different research projects that deal with <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> in cell-biological systems.

2500|$|Modern {{transistor}} or {{vacuum tube}} Tesla coils {{do not use}} a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, half-bridge, or full-bridge arrangement of bipolar transistors, MOSFETs or IGBTs to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The primary 'induces' alternating voltage into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular 'pushes' (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each [...] "push", and secondary output voltage builds (called 'ring-up'). An electronic <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary oscillator to the growing resonance in the secondary, {{and this is the}} only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.|$|E

Negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> {{have been well}} understood {{for a very long}} time; indeed, their understanding has been the basis for the engineering of cybernetic machines exhibiting stable behaviour. The importance of positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits,</b> considered as "vicious circles", has however been underestimated. In this article we give a demonstration based on degree theory for vector fields of the conjecture, made by Rene Thomas, that the presence of positive <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> is a necessary condition for autonomous differential systems, covering a wide class of biologically relevant systems, to possess multiple steady states. We also show ways to derive constraints on the weights of positive and negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits.</b> These qualitative and quantitative results provide respectively structural constraints (i. e. related to the interaction graph) and numerical constraints (i. e. related to the magnitudes of the interactions) on systems exhibiting complex behaviours, and should make it easier to reverse-engineer the interaction networks animating those systems on the basis of partial, sometimes unreliable, experimental data. We illustrate these concepts on a model multistable switch, in the context of cellular differentiation, showing a requirement for sufficient cooperativity. Further developments are expected in the discovery and modelling of regulatory networks in general, and in the interpretation of bio-array hybridisation and proteomics experiments in particular...|$|R

However, the mechanisms through which this neuromodulation therapy engages spinal circuits remain enigmatic. Using computer simulations and behavioral experiments, we {{provide evidence that}} epidural {{electrical stimulation}} interacts with muscle spindle <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> to modulate muscle activity during locomotion. Hypothesis-driven strategies emerging from simulations steered the design of stimulation protocols that adjust bilateral hindlimb kinematics throughout gait execution. These stimulation strategies corrected subject-specific gait and balance deficits in rats with incomplete and complete spinal cord injury. The conservation of muscle spindle <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> across mammals suggests that the same mechanisms may facilitate motor control in humans. These results provide a conceptual framework to improve stimulation protocols for clinical applications.

Results: Multi-Step Granger Causality Method (MSGCM) was developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological networks using time-series experimental measurements.

The repercussions of all this for the theory of retrenchment are elaborated. For clocked circuits, the techniques we present allow glitches and other transient errors to be properly described. For <b>feedback</b> <b>circuits,</b> the plethora of behaviours that can occur, give rise to infinitary fault trees of an appropriate kind. All this paves the way for automated fault tree generation for reactive systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: <b>Feedback</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{important}} motifs in biological networks {{and part of}} virtually all regulation processes that are needed for a reliable functioning of the cell. Mathematically, feedback is connected to complex behavior of the systems, which is often related to bifurcations of fixed points. Therefore, several approaches for the investigation of fixed points in biological networks have been developed in recent years. Many of them assume the fixed point coordinates to be known, and {{an efficient way to}} calculate the entire set of fixed points for interrelated feedback structures is highly desirable. Results: In this paper we consider regulatory network models, which are differential equations with an underlying directed graph that illustrates independencies among variables. We introduce the circuit-breaking algorithm (CBA), a method that constructs one-dimensional characteristics for these network models which inherit important information about the system. In particular, fixed points are related to the zeros of these characteristics. The CBA operates on the graph topology, and results from graph theory are used in order to make calculations efficient.

50|$|Some {{progress}} has been made in 2014 by Gero Miesenböck's lab at the University of Oxford analyzing Drosophila Olfactory system.In Drosophila, sparse odor coding by the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body is thought to generate a large number of precisely addressable locations for the storage of odor-specific memories. Lin et al. demonstrated that sparseness is controlled by a negative <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> between Kenyon cells and the GABAergic anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron. Systematic activation and blockade of each leg of this <b>feedback</b> <b>circuit</b> show that Kenyon cells activate APL and APL inhibits Kenyon cells. Disrupting the Kenyon cell-APL feedback loop decreases the sparseness of Kenyon cell odor responses, increases inter-odor correlations, and prevents flies from learning to discriminate similar, but not dissimilar, odors.
