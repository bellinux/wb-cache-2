5|$|One more rivalry {{from the}} Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL. In the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash, Cena {{eliminated}} JBL by making him {{submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> {{the neck of the}} opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. On the April 28 episode of Raw, JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at Judgment Day, which was made official on WWE's website.|$|E

Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} his thirteenth birthday, Paige {{was arrested for}} shoplifting. Because this {{incident}} followed several earlier incidents of theft and truancy, he was committed to the Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs, Alabama, the state reform school, {{until the age of}} eighteen. During the more than five years he spent at the school, he developed his pitching skills under the guidance of Edward Byrd. Byrd taught Paige to kick his front foot high and to swing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> so it looked like his hand was in the batter's face when he released the ball. Paige was released from the reform school in December 1923, six months early.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry would {{continue}} into the 2013 NBA Playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls {{in the second}} round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93–87 in game 1. The Heat came back in game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James {{early in the second}} quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers. Noah received a technical foul for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Noah's neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees.|$|E

25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
500|$|Robinson did, however, receive {{significant}} {{encouragement from}} several major league players. Robinson named Lee [...] "Jeep" [...] Handley, {{who played for}} the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, [...] "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color {{is not one of}} them." [...] In 1948, Reese put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati. A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Robinson. Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he [...] "whispered a few words into Robinson's ear", which Robinson later characterized as [...] "words of encouragement." [...] Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games. Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.|$|E
500|$|During his career, Getzein's drew acclaim for his curveball. [...] Getzein's {{version of}} the pitch was {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "pretzel curve." [...] Sporting Life described Getzein's unusual delivery as follows: [...] "In delivering his 'pretzels' 'Getz' faces third base with one foot in either corner of {{the lower end of the}} box. [...] Bending the left knee slightly, he draws his right arm well back. [...] Then, straightening up quickly, he slides the left foot forward with a characteristic little skip, and, bringing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> with a swift overhand swing, drives the ball in at a lively pace." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{and fans}} responded {{negatively}} to the episode's final sequence. Taylor described getting adverse fan mail {{about the lack}} of sympathy expressed by Voyagers crew members for Torres in the ending. She clarified that Chakotay's response to Torres was intended to be unresponsive rather than cold, and acknowledged that he should have [...] "put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her and show some warmth" [...] as suggested by fans. Green was surprised that Torres was not given a pep talk by either Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) or Chakotay in the final scene. Epsicokhan, on the other hand, found the lack of answers from Chakotay to be an appropriate ending given the focus on Torres' personal conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson {{directed}} the song's accompanying music video and filmed in Mexico, during October 2002. June Ambrose {{was hired as}} the personal stylist, and Johnathon Schaech and Lance Reddick appear in the video as the police officers on their tail. Jay-Z and Beyoncé play a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The video is loosely based on the American 1993 romance crime film True Romance, which stars Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as two lovers {{on the run from}} cocaine dealers. The choreography used in the clip suggests a relationship beyond screen, as Jay-Z wraps <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Beyoncé while singing his part of the chorus. The video also marked a departure for the [...] "clean-cut Beyoncé" [...] and created a symbiotic relationship between her and Jay-Z, allowing them to exchange audiences.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{says that}} acting in Star Trek was [...] "life-consuming" [...] {{and left him}} [...] "barely any time for family", {{and that this was}} the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He {{describes}} a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, Star Trek actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's fine-art photography, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that Star Trek became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been typecast {{as a result of their}} roles in Star Trek, and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at science fiction conventions, the fans seem to like each other more than they like the science fiction actors. The film concludes with Nimoy putting <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Shatner's shoulder and saying, [...] "You're my best friend." ...|$|E

[...] When Julie lets Billy put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} scripted into Backlash on the Raw brand was a Fatal Four Way {{match for the}} WWE Championship, a {{standard}} match involving four wrestlers between John Cena, Edge, Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton. At the Royal Rumble in January, Michaels {{was one of the}} final two participants in the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner before being eliminated by The Undertaker. On the February 5, 2007 episode of Raw, Michaels earned the right to become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania after defeating Edge and Orton in a Triple Threat match, a standard match involving three wrestlers. At WrestleMania, Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship, after [...] wrapping <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the neck of Michaels in a sleeper hold, a submission referred to as an STFU. On the April 9 episode of Raw, a standard match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number-one contender to the WWE Championship ended in a no contest, after both men's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another. Later that night, during Edge's talk show, [...] "The Cutting Edge", Edge claimed that General Manager Jonathan Coachman, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer had named him the number-one contender to the WWE title. Honorary General Manager Michael Pena, from the Make-a-Wish Foundation, however, announced that Michaels, Orton, and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a Fatal Four-Way match, a standard match involving four wrestlers.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} the Extreme Rules {{lumberjack}} match between Sabu and John Cena. Before the match began, the ECW and Raw superstars {{made their way}} to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks. The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks, in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring. Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks, at ringside. Throughout the match, Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair onto Cena's face. Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu. Mid-way in the match, the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside. At ringside, the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena, after [...] he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu. They laid his head on a table, in which Sabu attempted to perform a high-flying maneuver. The Raw superstars, however, gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a kendo stick in mid-air. Back in the ring, Cena hit Sabu with a steel chair then lifted him over his shoulders and threw him down on a table that was at ringside to execute the FU. Following this, Sabu was thrown back into the ring where Cena applied the STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent, in which Sabu submitted to and giving Cena the win.|$|E

500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{comes into}} the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks {{straight}} into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy says in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Andy and says to the office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E

Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club.
