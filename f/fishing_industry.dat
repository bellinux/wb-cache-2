5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> which {{continues}} to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Exploitation {{of aquatic}} bioresources in Ukraine was {{traditionally}} low. In {{order to provide}} the population of Ukraine with high-quality fish products, the task of <b>fish</b> <b>industry</b> workers {{in the country is}} to create appropriate conditions for increasing fish catches and improve the organization of labor and material provision at fish farms. Our immediate goal in the work was to identify the areas of reforms in the <b>fish</b> <b>industry,</b> which would ensure the progress in it and would be aimed at attracting investments in aquaculture, establishing fish protection bodies with a qualitative change in their working principles, forming a culture of socially responsible fishing, achieving transparency and openness {{in the work of the}} State Agency for Fisheries, as well as improving the efficiency of the functioning of state institutions. Methodology. The basis of the research is the scientific, statistical and reporting data in the <b>fish</b> <b>industry</b> of Ukraine. The research uses the methods of monitoring and retrospective analysis of recent research and publications. Findings. The information on the implementation of reforms in the field of <b>fish</b> <b>industry</b> in Ukraine is presented: change of territorial bodies, State Fisheries Agency, fisheries regimes, use of aquatic biological resources, regulatory framework, strengthening of international activities and use of foreign experience. In order to increase the capacity of the <b>fish</b> <b>industry,</b> it is being reformed in the direction of changing its structure, increasing funding, introducing foreign investment and using their expertise. Originality. The need for reforming the <b>fish</b> <b>industry</b> of Ukraine became highly important. Modern socio-economic conditions require changes in the approaches to the organization of the activity of f groups that are marked by significant technological, economic, organizational, regulatory and legal peculiarities that need to be taken into account in economic processes. In accordance with the need for changes in the <b>fish</b> <b>industry,</b> the importance of reforming the <b>fish</b> <b>industry</b> of Ukraine has become urgent. Practical value.

5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive downsizing of the <b>fishing</b> <b>industry.</b> The report by the Steering Committee for <b>Fishing</b> <b>Industry</b> Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive.

5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish <b>fishing</b> <b>industry.</b> After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the <b>fishing</b> <b>industry</b> throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 90 {{per cent}} of total catches in {{northern}} Sulawesi are pelagic fishes. About two-third {{of them are}} large pelagic fish, such as tunas (Katsuwonus, Thunnus, Euthynnus). However the National Assessment Stock Commission reported that availability of the large pelagic fishes in Sulawesi and Maluku Sea is just {{about one-third of the}} total pelagic fish resources. Even in the last report the large pelagic fishes in the region are indicating nearly overexploited. In contras, small pelagic fish such as mackerel scads, travellies, sardine, needlefish, Indian mackerel, and flyingfish is less than 40 per cent of the total allowable catch (TAC) exploited. Fishing activities on large pelagic fish by means of pole and line, longline etc. are mainly conducted by <b>fishing</b> <b>industries</b> based in the area of Bitung.
