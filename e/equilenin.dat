His thesis work is hailed even today as a major andrevolutionary break with the past. The total synthesis of the steroidal sex hormone <b>equilenin,</b> published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in 1940, was the first successful total synthesis of a complex natural product.

The Vitalism theory still distorted many people's views as to the relationship between [...] "ordinary" [...] chemicals and such esoterica as animal-isolated sex hormones.

40|$|Abstract. The syntheses of tetradeuterated analogs of the estrogenic steroids <b>equilenin</b> and equilin are described. The ∆ 7 olefin of equilin {{prevented}} the direct introduction {{of more than}} two deuteriums into this molecule, because of its sensitivity under the acidic conditions needed. Therefore conditions were developed for the tetradeuteration of <b>equilenin,</b> which was then converted to tetradeuterated equilin by a Birch reduction sequence. This chemistry provides both molecules deuterated at carbons 4, 6 and 16 (steroid nomenclature). Deuterium incorporation in the β-naphthol system of <b>equilenin</b> was shown to favor introduction at C. 4 and C. 6, without substitution at C. 2. The use of stable isotopic substrates as reference compounds for pharmaceutical products has aided in the development of mass spectrometry analysis to its current status as a powerful tool in determination of trace levels of drug substances and corresponding degradation or metabolic products in test samples. The accuracy of this technique is increased proportional to larger mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled substrate, because normal isotopic abundances in the unlabeled substrate will generate trace signals of higher isotopic peaks in its mass spectrum. For this reason, an internal standard is preferred which provides data lying outside the normal "background " of the substrate to be measured. As part of an ongoing program to develop standards for drug research purposes, we needed to consider the preparation of a tetradeuterated derivative of the estrogen equilin. Although it was quickly clear from probe experiments that the hydrogens at C. 16 could be rapidly exchanged wit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background An inverse {{relationship}} between the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and coronary heart disease (CHD) has been reported. In contrast, oxidized HDL (oHDL) {{has been shown to}} induce neuronal death and may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of CHD. In the present study we have investigated a: the effect of various equine estrogens on HDL oxidation, b: the inhibition of LDL oxidation by HDL and c: the effect of these estrogens on LDL oxidation in the presence of HDL. Results All 11 equine estrogens tested protected the HDL from oxidation in a concentration dependant manner. <b>Equilenin,</b> 17 β-dihydroequilenin, and 17 α-dihydroequilenin (Δ 6 – 8 -estrogens) were found to be the most potent inhibitors of HDL oxidation. Some of the novel ring B unsaturated estrogens were 2. 5 to 4 times more potent inhibitors of HDL oxidation than 17 β-estradiol. HDL was found to delay LDL oxidation. The protection of LDL oxidation by HDL is enhanced by the addition of estrogen, with <b>equilenin</b> being again more potent than 17 β-estradiol. Conclusions Equine estrogens can differentially inhibit the oxidation of HDL with the Δ 6 – 8 -estrogens being the most potent antioxidants. The ability of estrogens to enhance HDL's antioxidant activity is to our knowledge the first report of an interaction of estrogen with HDL that results in the delay or inhibition of LDL oxidation. This may be another mechanism by which estrogens may reduce the risk of CHD and neurodegenerative diseases in healthy and younger postmenopausal women. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{importance of}} enzyme active-site interactions is frequently assessed by mutating specific residues and measuring the resulting rate reductions. This {{approach has been}} used in bacterial ketosteroid isomerase to probe the energetic importance of active-site hydrogen bonds donated to the dienolate reaction intermediate. The conservative Tyr 16 Phe mutation impairs catalysis by 105 -fold, far larger than the effects of hydrogen bond mutations in other enzymes. However, the less-conservative Tyr 16 Ser mutation, which also perturbs the Tyr 16 hydrogen bond, results in a less-severe 102 -fold rate reduction. To understand the paradoxical effects of these mutations and clarify the energetic importance of the Tyr 16 hydrogen bond, we have determined the 1. 6 -Å resolution x-ray structure of the intermediate analogue, <b>equilenin,</b> bound to the Tyr 16 Ser mutant and measured the rate effects of mutating Tyr 16 to Ser, Thr, Ala, and Gly. The nearly identical 200 -fold rate reductions of these mutations, together with the 6. 4 -Å distance observed between the Ser 16 hydroxyl and <b>equilenin</b> oxygens in the x-ray structure, strongly suggest that the more moderate rate effect of this mutant is not due to maintenance of a hydrogen bond from Ser at position 16. These results, additional spectroscopic observations, and prior structural studies suggest that the Tyr 16 Phe mutation results in unfavorable interactions with the dienolate intermediate beyond loss of a hydrogen bond, thereby exaggerating the apparent energetic benefit of the Tyr 16 hydrogen bond relative to the solution reaction. These results underscore the complex energetics of hydrogen bonding interactions and site-directed mutagenesis experiments...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the roles of three cysteines in ketosteroid {{isomerase}} (KSI) from Pseudomonas putida biotype B, each of the cysteine residues has been changed to a serine residue (C 69 S, C 81 S, and C 97 S) by site-directed mutagenesis. All cysteine mutations caused only a slight decrease in the k(cat) value, with no significant change of Km for the substrate. Even modification of the sulfhydryl group with 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) has almost no effect on enzyme activity. These results demonstrate {{that none of the}} cysteines in the KSI from P. putida is critical for catalytic activity, contrary to the previous identification of a cysteine in an active-site-directed photoinactivation study of KSI. Based on the three-dimensional structures of KSIs with and without dienolate intermediate analog <b>equilenin,</b> as determined by X-ray crystallography at high resolution, Asp- 103 was found to be located within the range of the hydrogen bond to the <b>equilenin.</b> To assess the role of Asp- 103 in catalysis, Asp- 103 has been replaced with either asparagine (D 103 N) or alanine (D 103 A) by site-directed mutagenesis. For D 103 A mutant KSI there was a significant decrease in the k(cat) value: the k(cat) of the mutant was 85 -fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme; however, for the D 103 N mutant, which retained some hydrogen bonding capability, there was a minor decrease in the k(cat) value.

Smith and Smith have in fact shown that 600 - 700 r. u.

This difference {{may be due to the}} transformation of theelin (estrone) into a more active estrogen in the progestin-treated animal, or to a greater destruction of the estrone in the non-pregnant animal with no change in its chemical constitution. Estrone might conceivably be converted into four native estrogenic compounds in the organism, estradiol, estriol, equilin (and its isomer hippulin), and <b>equilenin</b> (Fieser (1936)). Of these, by ordinary test, estradiol is more active than estrone, estriol and <b>equilenin</b> less active, equilin and hippulin about as active. Since estradiol is the ovarian hormone and estrone a urine component it seems likely that the latter is an excretion product and not normally converted to the former; furthermore, estradiol has been recovered from the urine of mares in small amount only (Wintersteiner, Schwenk, and Whitman (1935)) while estrone is obtained in large amount.

Two endogenous human estrogens, 17 alpha-estradiol and 17 beta-estradiol, and two equine estrogens, equilin and <b>equilenin,</b> were utilized. Only 17 alpha-estradiol showed a statistical difference in the oxidative stress levels of astrocytes. However, the results indicate that differing estrogen concentration still had no effect on the oxidative stress levels in unstressed astrocyte populations...|$|E
40|$|Hypophyseal tumors occur {{rarely in}} mice. Only one mouse among 11, 000 autopsied in Dr. Slye's {{laboratory}} showed a hypophyseal tumor. 11 A chromophobe-cell adenoma of the pituitary gland {{was reported in}} a mouse which had bilateral granulosa-cell tumors of the ovaries. 6 This animal also showed evidence of hyperestrogenic stimulation, as indicated by multiple mammary tumors and uterine glandular cystic hyperplasia. Generalized hypertrophy of the pituitary gland occurs frequently in rats and mice receiving estrogens. 9 Almost simultaneously three groups of investigators reported hypophyseal adenomatous hypertrophy or adenomas in rats or mice receiving estrogens in large amounts over long periods. ' 2 On the other hand, such tumors were not observed among 11 1 mice of 3 different strains (A, CBA, and C 3 H) given estrogens, 4 while, in another laboratory,l one tumor was found among 679 mice. Lacassagne' 0 ascribed an initial failure to observe hypophyseal lesions to a contamination of the "folliculin" benzoate he used with equilin or <b>equilenin.</b> Recently, Zondek' 4 described large tumors of the pituitary gland in rats given large amounts of estrogens {{over a period of}} from 7 to 9 months. Some of these tumors weighed more than 300 mg...|$|E
40|$|Placental estriol in urine can be {{determined}} by rapid en-zymatic hydrolysis, extraction with neutral XAD- 2 resin, and quantitation by gas-liquid chromatography, with <b>equilenin</b> as the internal standard. Glucose, methenamine mandelate, hydrochlorothiazide, phenolphthalein, or sa-licylate do not interfere. Analytical recovery of estriol added to urine was 92 - 108 %. Day-to-day precision (CV), established by 15 replicate analyses at a mean concen-tration of 21. 3 mg/liter, was 6. 6 %. The assessment of urinary placental estriol (E 3) in pregnancy, {{as a measure of}} fetal well being, is well documented (1, 2). Numerous gas-liquid chromato-graphic (GLC) methods for urinary E 3 determinations have been reported (3 - 8). Most of these methods lack true internal standardization; hence there is no cor-rection for analytical variables-the internal standard is used only for peak quantitation. Smith and Stitch (8) used phenolphthalein as a true internal standard, but phenolphthalein is a commonly used laxative, and thus may be present in maternal urine. Interference is reportedly caused by glucose (9, 10), methenainine mandelate (11), hydrochlorothiazide (12), and phenolphthalein (9) in the determination of urinary E 3 after acid hydrolysis. Interference by salicylate (13) has also been reported when enzymatic hydrolysis is used. We describe a method that obviates many of these difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Although hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) is used by post-menopausal women for the relief of menopausal symptoms and the potential reduction of osteoporosis, HRT also increases their risk of Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. Since {{the majority of these}} effects are associated primarily with estrogen binding to only one of the estrogen receptors (ER), new assays are needed that can more efficiently evaluate ER-binding and identify ligands selective for ER-α and ER-β. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was combined with ultrafiltration as a new method to investigate the relative binding of compounds to the ERs and to evaluate the structures of these estrogens. Mixtures of estradiol and six equine estrogens, including equilin, <b>equilenin,</b> 8, 9 -dehydroestrone, and their 17 β-hydroxyl derivatives, were assayed simultaneously to determine their relative binding to human ER-α and ER-β. Estrogens containing a 17 β-OH group were found to have higher relative affinities for the estrogen receptors than their ketone analogs. In addition, 17 β-EN showed selectivity for binding to ER-β over ER-α. The results were compared to the IC 50 values obtained by using a conventional radiolabled estradiol competitive binding assay. Finally, the utility of negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for the unambiguous identification of these estrogen isomers was investigated. Several characteristic recyclization pathways during tandem mass spectrometry were identified, which might be useful for distinguishing related estrogens...|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, 2014. The seemingly simple proton abstraction reactions underpin many chemical transformations including isomerization reactions and are thus of immense biological significance. Despite the energetic cost, enzyme-catalyzed proton abstraction reactions show remarkable rate enhancements. The pathways leading to these accelerated rates are numerous and on occasion partly enigmatic. The isomerization of the steroid, Δ 5 - androstene- 3, 17 -dione by the human glutathione transferase A 3 - 3 in mammals was investigated to gain insight into the mechanism. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the nature of the transition state, the intermediate suspected of aiding this process and the hydrogen bonds postulated to be the stabilizing forces of these transient species. Kinetics studies on Δ 5 -androstene- 17 -one, a substrate that is incapable of forming hydrogen bonds reveal that such stabilizing forces are not a requirement to explain the observed rate enhancements. The UV-Vis detection of the intermediate places this specie in the catalytic pathway while fluorescence spectroscopy is used to obtain the binding constant of the intermediate analogue <b>equilenin.</b> Analysis of the kinetics data in terms of the Marcus formalism indicates that the human glutathione transferase A 3 - 3 lowers the intrinsic kinetic barrier by 3 kcal/mole. The results lead to the conclusion that this reaction proceeds through an enforced concerted mechanism in which the barrier to product formation is kinetically insignificant...|$|E
