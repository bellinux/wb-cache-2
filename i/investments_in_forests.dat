Yet, these natural ecosystems are increasingly lost or degraded. In the face of growing water-related challenges {{in an age of}} fiscal austerity, investing in the conservation, restoration, and man-agement of these ecosystems can represent a low cost alterna-tive or complement to concrete-and-steel built infrastructure options and serve as part of a viable adaptation strategy. How-ever, as they must with other forms of infrastructure, decision makers must understand the impacts of a changing climate on the provision of services from natural ecosystems. Impacts like changing species composition and increasing incidence of disturbances like wildfire, insects, and disease can affect the water-related function of upstream ecosystems, requiring ad-ditional and ongoing management interventions. This article lays out the basic underpinnings of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>forests</b> as an adaptation strategy for the provision of water-related services and the need for an iterative and flexible approach to manag-ing those investments over time to ensure their sustainability in a changing climate...|$|E

This study is presenting a first attempt to develop a framework to evaluate the ESG performance of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> planted <b>forests</b> and to identify relations {{between the use of}} SRI tools and the financial performance of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> planted <b>forests.</b> The analysis of 121 <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> planted <b>forests</b> allowed the identification of 339 organizations and 50 SRI tools (e. g. : management and investment standards, investment rating) operating with <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> planted <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> {{emerging markets}}. The analysis of the 50 SRI tools resulted in the definition of a ESG Reference Document including 155 issues. These issues were organized into an ESG Risk Assessment and have been tested in 12 case studies evenly distributed between Uganda, Cambodia and Vietnam. The results suggest that the most common instruments are management standards (e. g. : FSC), bank investment policies (e. g. : ABN AMRO Forest and Plantation Policy) and investment rating systems (e. g. : FairForest). The majority of the SRI tools have a broad sectoral approach and are managed by business organizations. Investors are using more than 30 SRI tools but these are characterized by a low level of control such as signature and/or participation or at the most a conformity declaration. On the contrary plantation companies are using less instruments but with top level of control such conformity assessment and certification. Aspects related to “Legal and Institutional framework” and “Environment” are the most represented inside SRI tools. On the contrary aspects such as “Minimum percentage of protected areas”, “Poverty reduction” and “Prevention of encroachment” are not only the less frequent issues but also the less controlled issues by SRI tools. The Gold Standard and the Forest Stewardship Council are the SRI tools with the highest performance among the 50 SRI tools analysed. The ESG Risk Assessment allows to identify the most important 25 issues and reveals that SRI tools are focusing on issues that on-the-ground are not the major risk sources. This is the case of “Third party certification” and “High Conservation Value Forests” (HCVFs). Few exemptions where SRI tools are properly identifying the major risks are “Tenure rights”, “Health and safety of workers” and “Social impact assessment”. Climate change impacts, long term financial sustainability, poverty reduction and encroachment are ranked as the most dangerous sources of risk across the 12 case studies. SRI tools are positively influencing the risk mitigation, accounting for a percentage of risk mitigation that ranges from 34. 31 till 60. 63 %.

So, clarification and enforcement of the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders are essential. For example, a good policy of environment protection and legal framework facilitates enforcement mechanisms with gradual sanctions. Thus, legal recognition of local institutions and endorsement of their bylaws are essential elements to encourage <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> resource management (Heinen and Mehta 1999; Bekele 2003; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015).

Supply restrictions limit adjustment options in management activities and force greater change in other endogenous elements such as price and consumption. Implications drawn from any policy analyses also differ with input supply assumptions. Policy impacts were found to be largely transitory in the cases without investment limits and essentially permanent when limits exist. Recognizing a price-sensitive land supply, at least as this process is represented in the present model, partially compensates for the imposition of borrowing restrictions, moving projections closer to behavior observed in the perfect capital market cases.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{decision-making}} framework {{to select the}} best land near a city for private <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> multiple-use urban forestry. More specifically, this thesis postulates that privately financed forest restoration for multiple-use urban forestry can add green infrastructure to ecologically impoverished landscapes in a city's rural-urban fringe. A strategic framework simplifies complex decision-making in land selection problems, and here a multi-criteria Boolean algebraic truth table is used to create the framework. A truth table cell is set to either true (YES) or false (NO) by checking the land plot conditions against each land selection criteria. The selection criteria included biophysical factors, zoning types, and threat of takings. The approach is illustrated with a bottomland area along the St. Jacques River, in the City of La Prairie, in Montreal's rural-urban fringe. A major conclusion is that a Boolean decision-making framework {{may be useful to}} evaluate property acquisition before making private forest investments. Of the property selection criteria examined, stability of property rights {{may be the most important}} to consider first. While private <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> restoration for future uses could add new <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> urban areas, several important regulatory takings cases in the past 20 years in the Montreal region may discourage investors from making long-term investments.

The monetary value of the major forest ecosystem services such as water conservation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen release, nutrient accumulation, atmosphere environment purification, and biodiversity conservation, was estimated to be about 10.01 trillion CNY/year (approximately 1.48 trillion US$/year) and is equivalent to one third of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP) (Niu et al, 2012). Of these, carbon (C) sequestration by planted forest is the most important service with about 0.3 Pg C having been sequestrated by planted <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> China since the mid- 1970 s.

40|$|ABSTRACT We apply a {{commodity}} systems analysis to exam-ine {{a series of}} changes that are transforming Alabama's pulp and paper industry. Alabama is a critical area for investigation be-cause it {{lies at the heart}} of North America's principle pulp and pa-per production zone. Industry restructuring is a complex process involving the reorganization of capital and corporate ownership, as well as changes in technologies, which affect the labor process. For example, a recent spate of corporate mergers has resulted in concentration of mill ownership and has accelerated the preva-lence of sub-contracting. Indeed, the expansion of sub-contracting into new realms raises the fundamental question of what constitutes a core activity in this capital-intensive indus-try. The consolidation process has not proceeded in a unidirec-tional manner, however. For example, some corporations have expanded <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> land, while other firms have ac-tively sought to divest themselves of direct ownership of such land, freeing capital for investment elsewhere.

These choices are driven by the need to maximise economic benefits from the options available. <b>In</b> the Cloud <b>Forest,</b> the focus is on forest clearance so that smallholder agriculture production can expand. <b>In</b> the Coffee <b>Forest,</b> the increasing economic returns from small-scale coffee harvesting have meant that forest clearance has been halted, but the remaining forest is altered as a result of coffee cultivation. This paper identifies interventions that could increase the value of forest-based activities and products so that livelihood choices are more supportive of forest maintenance. It concludes {{that there is a need}} to maximise non-timber forest product revenue, alongside the development of other forest products, including wood and carbon, to make the forests competitive compared to agricultural land use. This exploitation of forest resources will not preserve these <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> pristine condition, but is a pragmatic response which could ensure that they continue to provide the majority of the economic, social and environmental services currently provided. However, to achieve this, major institutional and policy changes are required, as well as a significant <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> enterprise development and training and carbon funding through REDD+...|$|R
40|$|With {{increased}} attention to and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> products (especially “NTFP”), {{there is a}} real need for more systematic understanding of the true role and potential of forest products to achieve development and conservation objectives. Information is required to improve the effectiveness of investment and policy interventions. There is a rich base of information from many case studies and development projects that have been done on various aspects of forest product development. But, this information has been assembled in an ad-hoc fashion, using a range of methods, at different scales, and focusing on different elements of the forest product production, processing and marketing systems. Work is needed to document and compare cases using consistent terms and definitions for an appropriate range of variables. This paper describes a method to do this. It involves collating information from many cases that have already been studied. Cases will be documented and described using a standardized set of descriptors, and this data matrix will be used {{as the basis for the}} comparative analysis. Exploratory data analysis will be used to outline patterns, gradients of variability, clusters of cases and key variables associated with them. The goal is to create typologies of cases, identify conditions associated with particular kinds of development and conservation outcomes, and identify and test hypotheses about forest produc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{identifies}} timberland {{areas in}} 12 western states where thinning treatments (1) are {{judged to be}} needed to reduce fire hazard and (2) may “pay for themselves ” at a scale to make <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>forest</b> product processing a realistic option. A web-based tool—Fuel Treatment Evaluator 3. 0 —is used to select high-fire-hazard timberland plots from the Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) database and provide results of simulated thinning treatments. Areas were identified where either torching or crowning is likely during wildfires when wind speeds are below 25 mph. After additional screens are applied, 24 million acres are deemed eligible for treatment (14 million acres on federal lands). Uneven-aged and even-aged silvicultural treatments analyzed would treat 7. 2 to 18. 0 million of the 24 million acres, including 0. 8 to 1. 2 million acres of wildland–urban interface area, and provide 169 to 640 million ovendry tons of woody biomass. About 55 percent of biomass would be from main stem of trees ≥ 7 inches d. b. h. Sixty to {{seventy percent of the}} area to be treated is in California, Idaho, and Montana. Volumes and harvest costs from two treatments on the 14 million acres of eligible federal lands are used as inputs to the fuel treatment market model for U. S. West (FTM–West) discussed in these proceedings...|$|R

Previous studies that analyzed forest carbon policies have typically focused on market impacts in the forestry sector, such as changes in production, consumption, prices, and trade. I n this study, we consider their inter-sectoral l inkages to explore the policy spillover effects. Our focus {{is to examine the}} potential economy-wide, land use, welfare and trade impacts of two potential <b>forest</b> carbon policies <b>in</b> the U. S. and Canada. Specifically, we employ a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a global scope to simulate the policy scenarios of: 1) a global expansion of forest carbon plantations with and without U. S. participation; and 2) domestic carbon subsidies in the U. S. to motivate jOint production of carbon and timber from forests by private forestland owners. The results of our simulations suggest that implementation of either policy in the U. S. (Le. expanding forest carbon plantations or implementing carbon subsidies) will be generally favorable to the domestic forest and agricultural sectors, but will have small negative impacts on overall welfare. The <b>forest</b> sector, <b>in</b> particular, enjoys substantial gains from increased competitiveness in relation to the other timber producing reg ions...|$|R
