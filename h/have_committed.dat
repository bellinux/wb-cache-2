5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to <b>have</b> <b>committed</b> the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed.

Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could <b>have</b> <b>committed</b> the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E

5|$|Spokane and the Spokane Police Department (SPD) have {{received}} national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of excessive force.

Zehm was later found to <b>have</b> <b>committed</b> no crime, but was struck with batons by several officers and tasered.

The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may <b>have</b> <b>committed</b> in his sworn deposition during Jones v.
