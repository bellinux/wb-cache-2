In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro.

2500|$|To reduce <b>government</b> <b>borrowing,</b> the March 1993 budget {{announced}} a rising wedge of tax increases – £0.5bn {{in the first}} year, £6.7bn in the second, rising to £10.3bn in the third, the aim being to give markets confidence that <b>government</b> <b>borrowing</b> was under control without damaging the recovery. Although the budget provoked a fierce reaction {{in some parts of}} the press, its reputation improved with the passage of time. After the 2009 budget, the Sunday Times editorialised that Lamont's budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months, [...] "but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond" [...] and Derek Scott, Tony Blair's economic adviser from 1997 to 2003, wrote that Lamont was [...] "rightly praised" [...] for putting in place the post-ERM framework, that stage of Lamont's career being [...] "due for rerating since, in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy (later consolidated by Bank of England independence in 1997), he also took most of the tough decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery." [...] Sir Alan Walters, whose opposition to the ERM as Mrs Thatcher's economic adviser triggered Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor, wrote on the buoyant state of the British economy in 2001 that [...] "all the difficult and correct decisions that produced this happy state of affairs were taken and implemented by Norman Lamont, who thus showed himself, in his Mark 2 post ERM version, to be not only the most effective but also the bravest Chancellor since the War." ...|$|E
2500|$|The example {{given in}} {{the table at the}} right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is {{constructed}} using either LIBOR rates or swap rates. [...] A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. [...] If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government bond yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. [...] The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the government bond yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above <b>government</b> <b>borrowing,</b> of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders. [...] For the U. S. market, a common benchmark for such a spread is given by the so-called TED spread.|$|E
2500|$|Lamont's second {{task was}} to reduce <b>government</b> <b>borrowing,</b> which was rising sharply because of the twofold impact of the ERM on the public finances. The loss of output had reduced tax {{revenues}} and increased public spending as unemployment rose. The sharp falls in inflation further reduced tax revenues compared to previous forecasts {{at the same time}} as increasing public spending after inflation, because public spending is planned in cash terms which becomes worth more in real terms if inflation falls. The March 1993 budget forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993-94 of £50bn, equivalent to 8% of GDP. [...] In terms of the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, the definition currently in use to measure the UK government deficit, the actual deficit for 1993–94 of 6.9% was the highest since 1975–76 at 9.2% but just over half the 13.3% deficit projected for 2009–10 in the April 2009 budget.|$|E

2500|$|Turkey's {{impressive}} {{economic performance}} in the 1980s won high marks from Wall Street's credit-rating agencies. In 1992 and 1993, the government used these ratings to attract funds to cover its budget deficits. International bond issues over this period amounted to US$7.5 billion. These capital flows helped maintain the overvalued exchange rate. In a market economy, {{a high level of}} <b>government</b> <b>borrowing</b> should translate into higher domestic interest rates and even possibly [...] "crowd out" [...] private-sector borrowers, thereby eventually slowing economic growth. But the government's foreign borrowing took the pressure off domestic interest rates and actually spurred more private-sector borrowing in an already overheated economy. Sensing an easy profit opportunity during this period, commercial banks borrowed at world interest rates and lent at Turkey's higher domestic rates without fear of a depreciating currency. As a result, Turkey's foreign short-term debt rose sharply. External and internal confidence in the government's ability to manage the impending balance of payments crisis waned, compounding economic difficulties.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2004 former Boeing CEO Harry Stonecipher accused Airbus of abusing a 1992 {{bilateral}} EU-US agreement {{providing for}} disciplines for large civil aircraft support from governments. Airbus is given reimbursable launch investment (RLI), called [...] "launch aid" [...] by the US, from European governments {{with the money}} being paid back with interest plus indefinite royalties, {{but only if the}} aircraft is a commercial success. Airbus contends that this system is fully compliant with the 1992 agreement and WTO rules. The agreement allows up to 33 per cent of the programme cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of <b>government</b> <b>borrowing</b> plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support. Airbus claims that since the signature of the EU-US agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.|$|E

2500|$|Two broad {{categories}} of private pension plans are [...] "defined benefit pension plans" [...] and [...] "defined contribution pension plans." [...] Of these two, Social Security is {{more similar to}} a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based {{on some sort of}} pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address. He described the Social Security system as [...] "headed for bankruptcy", and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new <b>government</b> <b>borrowing</b> to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See Social Security debate (United States).|$|E
2500|$|After Britain's {{exit from}} the ERM, Lamont had two major tasks: to replace the ERM with a new {{framework}} for monetary [...] to replace the ERM and to address the sharp increase in <b>government</b> <b>borrowing</b> caused by the recession and the rapid fall in inflation. In {{a letter to the}} Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in October 1992, Lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting. He set a target range for inflation excluding mortgage interest rate payments (which can otherwise lead to distortions) of 1 – 4%, falling into {{the lower part of the}} range by the end of the Parliament. In assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target, there was a target for the growth of narrow money (M0) and monitoring ranges for the growth of broad money (M4). Decisions on interest rates would also take account of house and asset price inflation and the exchange rate. Transparency and market credibility would be enhanced by publication of a monthly monetary assessment and the Bank of England was asked to produce a quarterly inflation report. These innovations marked a decisive break with the past and a necessary step toward central bank independence. Inflation targeting was the basis on which the Bank of England was made independent by the Blair government in 1997, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee being made accountable for achieving the government's inflation target.|$|E
2500|$|During the Great Depression, the {{definitive}} liberal {{response to it}} was given by the English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). Keynes had been [...] "brought up" [...] as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal. A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. [...] Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He wrote, [...] "For <b>Government</b> <b>borrowing</b> {{of one kind or}} another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill". At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936, and served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The General Theory challenged the earlier neo-classical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. Classical economists had believed in Say's law, which, simply put, states that [...] "supply creates its own demand", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of price stickiness – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of [...] "aggregate demand" [...] and [...] "aggregate supply" [...] may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, and not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation.|$|E
