5|$|Using {{hormonal}} combined contraceptive pills {{also helps}} {{in reducing the}} chances of PID by thickening the cervical mucosal plug & hence preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{are usually}} {{the main cause of}} PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b> N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.|$|E
5|$|Other {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} health issues include sex education, puberty, sexuality and sexual function. Women also experience {{a number of}} issues related to the health of their breasts and <b>genital</b> <b>tract,</b> which fall into the scope of gynaecology.|$|E
40|$|Reports {{that men}} with mucoviscidosis were sterile and that {{portions}} of their <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> were atretic prompted us to investigate the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of 15 male infants with mucoviscidosis who died within {{the first year of}} life and came to necropsy. The <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of all of these infants were abnormal, the abnormalities being confined to mesonephric derivatives. Hypoplastic or absent ducti efferentia, ducti epididymides, or ducti deferentia were found in all 28 specimens of epididymides, and the ducti deferentia were missing from 25 of 27 examples of spermatic cord. The seminal vesicles and the ejaculatory ducts were less frequently hypoplastic or absent. Because these abnormalities of mesonephric derivatives were present so early in life and inflammatory and obstructive changes were absent we believe that they resulted from a failure of development...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> {{are rare}} in occurrence and on records in cats. Unilateral agenesis of <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> is recorded in dogs, cattle, pig. However the ovarian agenesis {{is rare in}} cats. The unilateral agenesis of genital parts {{may be attributed to}} the indiscriminate breeding (inbreeding). Two year female cat presented for elective ovariohysterectomy is described in this paper. A general examination did not reveal any preeoperative problem. Ovariohysterectomy was performed in routine method...|$|R

5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and <b>genital</b> <b>tract,</b> and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E

50|$|Various {{processes}} {{are involved in}} the development of sex differences in humans. Sexual differentiation in humans includes development of different genitalia and the internal <b>genital</b> <b>tracts,</b> breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.|$|R
50|$|Paratrichodorus is a genus of {{terrestrial}} root feeding (stubby-root) nematodes in the Trichodoridae family (trichorids), {{being one of}} five genera. They are economically important plant parasites and virus vectors. The females are didelphic (two <b>genital</b> <b>tracts),</b> and are distributed worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The {{two largest}} genera have didelphic females (two <b>genital</b> <b>tracts),</b> and are {{distributed}} worldwide.

25|$|The lower bowel may {{be treated}} {{directly}} with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female <b>genital</b> <b>tract).</b> Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{subspecies}} equisimilis (SDSE) is a commensal {{in human}} alimentary tract and <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b> Occasionally it is isolated from skin, but usually {{in relation to}} a chronic skin condition or some breach of the epithelial barrier.|$|E
40|$|Bull semen is {{commonly}} contaminated with mycoplasmas. To determine {{the source of}} contamination, semen and the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of 45 artificial insemination bulls were cultured for these organisms. The results indicate that mycoplasmas colonize the prepuce and the distal part of the urethra. Only rarely were they found in the ampullae or seminal vesicles. In 92 % of the bulls with contaminated semen the same Mycoplasma species or Ureaplasma diversum was isolated from the prepuce and urethral orifice as {{was found in the}} semen. This suggests that the prepuce and distal urethra is the source of contamination. Colonization of the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> with Mycoplasmas or U. diversum was not associated with histological changes...|$|R
40|$|Cervical swabs and serum {{samples were}} taken from Swiss herds of sows with high rates of {{irregular}} return to oestrus (group A) and from control herds without reproductive problems (group B. The <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of 21 slaughtered sows of group A were also examined. The swabs and <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> were screened for Chlamydiae by a new 16 S rRNA PCR and the sera by an ELISA for Chlamydiaceae lipopolysaccharide. Chlamydophila (Cp) abortus was isolated from seven of the 65 swabs taken from group A but from none of the 128 swabs taken from group B. Chlamydia suis was present in swabs from both groups A (1. 5 per cent) and B (2. 3 per cent). In addition, Cp abortus was detected in 33. 3 per cent of the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts.</b> Of the 193 sera tested, 61. 7 per cent were positive, with {{no significant difference between}} group A (52. 3 per cent) and group B (66. 4 per cent).

40|$|Gardnerella vaginalis {{has been}} {{isolated}} from women with bacterial vaginosis, from the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of asymptomatic women, and from several other infected body sites in humans. However, until recently, {{it has not}} been isolated from any other animal species. Between June 1988 and October 1989, 31 isolates identified as G. vaginalis and 70 isolates identified as G. vaginalis-like organisms have been recovered from the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of 93 mares from Michigan and Ohio. Identification was based on biochemical reactions, hemolysis on media containing blood from various animal sources, and susceptibility to select antimicrobial agents. This report details the characterization of G. vaginalis and G. vaginalis-like organism isolates obtained from the reproductive tracts of these mares and compares the equine isolates with human isolates...|$|R
25|$|Another primary {{mechanism}} of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration through the cervix into the upper <b>genital</b> <b>tract</b> (uterus and fallopian tubes) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the viscosity of the cervical mucus.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that HIV-infected women with {{bacterial}} vaginosis (BV) are more likely to transmit HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV. Diagnostic criteria for BV have also been associated with a female <b>genital</b> <b>tract</b> factor that induces expression of HIV.|$|E
25|$|Puerperal sepsis is an {{ascending}} {{infection of}} the <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b> It may happen during or after labour.

40|$|Serological typing {{of human}} genital T-mycoplasmas by a complement-dependent mycoplasmacidal test showed that some recent {{isolates}} had different serotypic behavior {{before and after}} purification, and that the widely distributed prototype strain T 960 was composed {{of at least two}} different serotypes. These results indicate that T-mycoplasma isolates from human <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> are not serologically homogeneous...|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{differentiation}} {{in humans}} {{is the process}} of development of sex differences in humans. It is defined as the development of phenotypic structures consequent to the action of hormones produced following gonadal determination. Sexual differentiation includes development of different genitalia and the internal <b>genital</b> <b>tracts,</b> breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.|$|R
25|$|Salpingitis is an {{infection}} and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes. It {{is often used}} synonymously with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although PID lacks an accurate definition and can refer to several diseases of the female upper <b>genital</b> <b>tract,</b> such as endometritis, oophoritis, myometritis, parametritis and infection in the pelvic peritoneum.|$|E
25|$|The copper IUD's primary {{mechanism}} of action is to prevent fertilization. Active substances released from the IUD, together with products derived from the inflammatory reaction present in the luminal fluids of the <b>genital</b> <b>tract,</b> are toxic for spermatozoa and oocytes, preventing the encounter of healthy gametes {{and the formation of}} viable embryos.|$|E
25|$|In males, {{masturbation}} flushes out old sperm {{with low}} motility from the male's <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b> The next ejaculate then contains more fresh sperm, which have higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse. If {{more than one}} male has intercourse with a female, the sperm with the highest motility will compete more effectively.|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{urogenital}} sinus (PUGS) {{is a rare}} anomaly {{whereby the}} urinary and <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> fail to separateÂ during embryonic development. We report a three-year-old female child who was referred to the Sabah Women &Â Children Hospital, Sabah, Malaysia, in 2016 with a pelvic mass. She had been born prematurely at 36 gestationalÂ weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery in 2013 and initially misdiagnosed with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Â The external genitalia appeared normal and an initial sonogram and repeat micturating cystourethrograms didÂ not indicate any urogenital anomalies. She therefore underwent clean intermittent catheterisation. Three yearsÂ later, the diagnosis was corrected following the investigation of a persistent cystic mass posterior to the bladder. AtÂ this time, a clinical examination of the perineum showed a single opening into the introitus. Magnetic resonanceÂ imaging of the pelvis revealed gross hydrocolpos and a genitogram confirmed a diagnosis of PUGS, for which theÂ patient underwent surgical separation of the urinary and <b>genital</b> <b>tracts...</b>|$|R

25|$|Initial {{symptoms}} include fever, loss of appetite, and nasal and eye discharges. Subsequently, irregular erosions {{appear in the}} mouth, {{the lining of the}} nose, and the <b>genital</b> <b>tract.</b> Acute diarrhea, preceded by constipation, is also a common feature. Most animals die six to twelve days after the onset of these clinical signs.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia infection, often simply {{known as}} chlamydia, is a sexually {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles. The infection can spread to the upper <b>genital</b> <b>tract</b> in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, <b>genital</b> <b>tract,</b> or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of Xiphinema insigne with several males {{was found on}} the campus of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in November 1998 in the rhizosphere of Yulan Magnolia. Morphometrics of nine males and 25 females of this population are given herein. No sperm were found in the <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> of 118 females that were examined. This agrees with all other observations reported for this species except for the synonym of X. insigne, X. neodimorphicaudatum, in which males are as common as females and the females <b>genital</b> <b>tracts</b> contain numerous sperm. In the males of this study population, sperm were observed only in the seminal vesicles at the distal end of the testes before their juncture with the vas deferens. The population did not fit within either of the two forms of the species. This and other populations have filled in the gaps between the two forms, making the morphometrics for all reported populations a continuum...|$|R
