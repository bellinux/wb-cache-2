500|$|The tammar has 324° {{peripheral}} vision and 50° binocular vision. It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths {{and in different}} light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless {{not as good as}} a cat or a human. Tammars appear to have some colour vision: [...] its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as [...] apart. The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds from different parts of its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> quickly drops. When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.|$|E

50|$|Some {{surgeons}} {{perform a}} reduction of the subcutaneous soft tissue. The rationale for this {{is to reduce the}} mobility between implant and skin to avoid inflammation at the penetration site. This reduction of the soft tissue has been questioned and some surgeons do not perform any or a minimum of it. The rationale for this is that any surgery will result in some scar tissue that could be the focus of infection. The infections seen early during the development of the surgical procedure could perhaps be explained by the lack of seal between implant and abutment allowing bacteria to enter the space. A new helium tight seal may be advantageous and prevent biofilm formation. This will also allow the surgeon to use longer abutments should a need exist.

ObjectiveTo {{examine the effect of}} betahistine on hearing function in not-previously-treated patients with Ménière's disease and to define possible contributors in this regard. MethodsA total of 200 not-previously-treated patients with definite unilateral Ménière's disease received betahistine by mouth (initial dose, 16 mg three times a day; maintenance dose, 24 – 48 mg daily in divided doses). Changes in indicators of hearing status before and six months after treatment were documented. Hearing loss was considered as the mean <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> > 25 dB HL at five frequencies. ResultsThe mean duration of disease was 3. 37 years. Six months after treatment the mean <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> decreased by 6. 35 dB compared to that at the baseline (p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{estimate}} the risk for lowered speech-language outcomes associated with early recurrent otitis media with effusion (OME) with and without hearing loss and to develop a preliminary descriptive-explanatory model for the findings. Three statistical approaches were used to assess associations among OME, hearing loss, and speech-language outcomes. Participants were a subsample of 70 children followed prospectively in the Dallas Cooperative Project on Early Hearing and Language Development (Friel-Patti & Finitzo, 1990). Findings indicated that <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months were significantly associated with speech delay and low language outcomes at 3 years of age. The risk for subclinical or clinical speech delay at 3 years of age was 2 % for children with less than 20 dB average <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months and 33 % for children with greater than 20 dB average <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months. A structural equation model (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993) indicated that the significant and substantial effects of <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months on speech status at 3 years were significantly mediated by language status at 3 years. Discussion includes implications of these findings for alternative speech perception models linking early OME and hearing loss to later speech-language disorder.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} factors pre-implantation {{associated with}} post-implantation speech perception {{improvement in the}} adult congenitally deaf population. Design: Forty four adult cochlear implant (CI) patients who had a severe to profound hearing loss from birth were identified from this centre’s database. Eight pre-implantation factors: speech intelligibility, pre-implantation <b>hearing</b> <b>levels,</b> communication mode, pre-implantation speech perception scores, progression of hearing loss, age at implantation, hearing aid use pre-implantation and gender were recorded during the cochlear implant assessment process. These factors were investigated to determine their effect on speech perception improvement post-implantation. The outcome measures were the improvement in scores for the BKB sentence test and CUNY sentence test with lip-reading after implantation. In the final analysis 26 patients {{were included in the}} CUNY analysis, 30 in the BKB analysis. Results: Speech Intelligibility Rating, pre-implantation <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> and communication mode were shown to be significantly associated with improvements in speech perception post-implantation. Conclusion: Three factors were identified that affected speech perception improvement post-implantation: speech intelligibility, pre-implantation <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> and communication mode. These factors can be used to counsel CI patients regarding potential speech perception improvements from cochlear implantation, although these are based on average data and may not reflect individual performance. <br/...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effect of {{short-term}} ventilation tubes in children aged 1 to 2 yr with screening-detected, bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) persisting for 4 to 6 mo, as compared with watchful waiting. DESIGN: Multi-center randomized controlled trial (N = 187) with two treatment arms: short-term ventilation tubes versus watchful waiting. Young children underwent auditory screening; those with persistent (4 to 6 mo) bilateral OME were recruited. RESULTS: The mean duration of effusion over 1 -yr follow-up was 142 days (36 %) in the ventilation tube (VT) group versus 277 days (70 %) in the watchful waiting (WW) group. After 6 mo of follow-up, the pure-tone average in the VT group was 5. 6 dB A better than that in the WW group. After 12 mo, most of the advantage in the VT group had disappeared. After the insertion of ventilation tubes, the children with poorer <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at randomization improved more than the children with better <b>hearing</b> <b>levels.</b> The largest difference in <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> {{was found between the}} children in the VT group whose ventilation tubes remained in situ and the children in the WW group. In the VT children with recurrence of OME, the <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> again increased, but remained slightly lower than those in the infants with persistent OME in the WW group. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilation tubes have a beneficial effect on hearing in the short run (6 mo); this effect, however, largely disappears in the long run (12 mo).

40|$|AIMS: To {{identify}} {{subgroups of}} children with otitis media with effusion (OME) that might benefit more than others from treatment with ventilation tubes. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis on seven randomised controlled trials (n = 1234 children in all), focusing on interactions between treatment and baseline characteristics [...] <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> (HL), history of acute otitis media, common colds, attending day-care, gender, age, socioeconomic status, siblings, season, passive smoking, and history of breast feeding. Outcome measures that could be studied were mean time spent with effusion (n = 557), mean hearing levels (n = 557 in studies that randomised children, and n = 180 in studies that randomised ears), and language development (n = 381). RESULTS: In the trials that treated both ears the only significant interaction was between day-care and surgery, occurring where mean <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> was the outcome measure. None of the other baseline variables showed an interaction effect with treatment that would justify subgrouping. In the trials that treated only one ear, the baseline <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> showed a significant but not pervasive interaction with treatment-that is, only with a cut-off of 25 dB HL.

PATIENTS: Patients with clinically diagnosed chronic suppurative otitis media and cholesteatoma awaiting tympanomastoidectomy were recruited. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent tympanomastoidectomy by the same surgeon. A first cohort of 12 patients underwent posterior canal wall reconstruction with autogenous conchal cartilage. A second cohort of 12 patients underwent such reconstruction with prefabricated bioactive glass. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary- All patients underwent out-patient review at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, after which a second-look procedure was performed. Reconstructions were inspected for evidence of epithelialization, granulation, infection, stenosis, depression and extrusion. Secondary- All patients had perioperative serial pure-tone audiometry to check for any change in <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> upto 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: By 1 year postoperatively, both reconstructive graft materials showed good epithelialization, no granulation, no infection, no ear canal stenosis, no depression and no extrusion. At operative second-looks, bioactive glass particularly showed good tissue bonding, including both neovascularization and connective tissue integration. Overall clinical outcome was equivalent for both materials. Both graft materials showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in postoperative <b>hearing</b> <b>levels.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive glass and conchal cartilage showed equivalent clinical outcome in reconstructing the posterior canal wall without significantly affecting <b>hearing</b> <b>levels.</b> As bioactive glass does not require second site morbidity and thus also reduces operative time, we prefer it for reconstructing the posterior canal wall following tympanomastoidectom...|$|R
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Different {{members of}} the Nogo system are {{expressed}} in the mammalian cochlea. BACKGROUND: The protein Nogo has gained {{a lot of attention}} during {{the last couple of years}} because it inhibits neurite outgrowth in the adult central nervous system. In contrast to the central nervous system, very little is known regarding the expression and possible function of the Nogo system within the inner ear. METHODS: Using reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, we analyzed for the expression of {{members of the}} Nogo system within the cochlea. In addition, we determined <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> of Nogo A knockout and wild-type mice with auditory brainstem response audiometry. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate the expression of Nogo A, B, C, and of Nogo receptor mRNA in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Nogo A and Nogo receptor localize to the spiral ganglion neurons. Interestingly, Nogo A expression was also observed in the outer and inner hair cells of the organ of Corti. As revealed by light microscopy, deletion of Nogo A does not alter cochlear microanatomy. We have assessed <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> in 10 -month old wild-type and Nogo A knockout mice, and thereby, we could not detect any differences between these 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Different members of the Nogo family are expressed in the mammalian cochlea. Deletion of Nogo A does not alter cochlea microanatomy or <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> compared with wild-type mice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hypoacusis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} sensory disability {{in the world and}} consequently, it can lead to impede speech in human beings. One best approach to tackle this issue is to conduct early and effective hearing screening test using Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG based <b>hearing</b> threshold <b>level</b> determination is most suitable for persons who lack verbal communication and behavioral response to sound stimulation. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) is a type of EEG signal emanated from the brain scalp by an acoustical stimulus. The goal of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge in estimating the <b>hearing</b> threshold <b>levels</b> based on AEP response. AEP response reflects the auditory ability level of an individual. An intelligent <b>hearing</b> perception <b>level</b> system enables to examine and determine the functional integrity of the auditory system. Systematic evaluation of EEG based <b>hearing</b> perception <b>level</b> system predicting the hearing loss in newborns, infants and multiple handicaps will be a priority of interest for future research...|$|R
