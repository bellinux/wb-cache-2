25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E

(a) This Standard {{presents}} {{screw thread}} gauging systems suitable {{for determining the}} acceptability of Unified UN, UNR threads only, UNJ and external threads, M, and MJ screw <b>threads</b> on <b>externally</b> and internally <b>threaded</b> products. It establishes the criteria for screw thread acceptance when a gauging system is used.(b) A screw thread gauging system comprises a list of screw thread characteristics that must be inspected to establish the dimensional acceptability of the screw threads on a threaded product and the gauge(s) which shall be used when inspecting those characteristics.(c) Federal Government Use.

It also establishes the criteria for screw thread acceptance when a gauging system is used.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{striking}} and celebrated examples of collocytes {{are those of the}} Ctenophora (comb jellies). The Ctenophora use their colloblasts or collocytes in hunting and gathering food, {{in much the same way}} as members of the Cnidaria use cnidocytes; they keep the cells in a retracted form until they deploy them for securing prey. In keeping with their food capturing function, the collocytes sometimes are called [...] "lasso cells", but as is to be expected of common names, the term is not precise and is variously applied to both colloblasts and cnidocytes. The retracted mechanism is kept coiled in the Ctenophora, as opposed to inside out in the Cnidaria. The Cnidaria evert their stings to penetrate the prey, but the Ctenophora eject microscopic balls of adhesive mucus that stick to the prey <b>externally,</b> trailing <b>threads</b> that as a rule do not lose attachment to the parent colloblast. The structure of these specialized cells is extremely complex and varies among ctenophore species. Their mechanisms are still under study.|$|R
5000|$|A bolt is an <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> {{fastener}} {{designed for}} insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally {{intended to be}} tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fastener which {{is prevented from being}} turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.) An <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Named {{because the}} bar has smooth ends with {{receiving}} threads tapped {{into the end}} of the bar. In internally threaded jewelry, the bead has a receiving tube machined into it (this is referred to as [...] "countersunk"), with a threaded post extending from the center, which mates with the threaded receiving tube on the bar. Being much less likely to cause damage and irritation, especially at the time of piercing, internally threaded jewelry is considered superior to <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> jewelry. It is usually slightly more expensive than <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> jewelry, due to the extra machining and labor involved.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{two studies}} {{related to the}} design of cold-formed steel connections. The study topics included the creation of a test standard for determining the strength of a screw, and the determination of the strength of a screw connection. A standard test protocol does not exist for determining the strength of a screw. Today, manufacturers use test protocols developed for their products. Thus, there is no consistency in defming the structural performance of a screw. A test standard has been developed. The standard used as its model the American Society of Testing and Material's F 606, Standard Test Methods for Determining the Mechanical Properties of <b>Externally</b> and Internally <b>Threaded</b> Fasteners and Rivets. Tests have been conducted to show the practicality of the proposed test standard. The connection strength equations in the AISI design specification are based primarily on tests of single- and double-screw connection tests. Also, design assumes that the connection strength is proportional to the number of screws. The connection strength study considered the variation of connection strength with the number of screws, the screw center-to-center spacing, and the location of the screws in the connection...|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an <b>externally</b> knurled, internally <b>threaded,</b> round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R

50|$|ASTM A193/A193M is a {{specification}} {{from the}} ASTM International that primarily govern industrial piping applications. In {{the assembly of}} an industrial plant, many complex components are bolted together of which include parts such as valves, piping, and pressure vessels. ASTM A193 defines the methodology to procure and certify <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fasteners according to specific chemical and mechanical criteria. It is standards such as this that allow industrial process applications to be safely engineered so they do not exceed the tensile strength of the fasteners that hold them together.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread seal tape, or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope, however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{at first}} glance the {{manufacture}} of threaded jewelry might appear to be of contemporary origin, there are examples of <b>externally</b> <b>threaded,</b> straight barbells being used by tribal people, most notably the Dayak of Borneo. In contemporary society, barbell-style jewelry was popularized by Jim Ward, founder of Gauntlet (the first body piercing studio in the United States), in the 1970s. He was introduced to barbell-style jewelry by Horst Heinrich Streckenbach [...] "Tattoo Samy" [...] (1926-2001), a tattooist and piercer from Frankfurt, Germany, and his student Manfred [...] "Piker" [...] Kohrs from Hanover, Germany.|$|E
50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The {{shutter release button}} is situated on the right-hand camera front <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the shutter release button.|$|E
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|E
50|$|Bolts {{have been}} defined as headed {{fasteners}} having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fasteners that {{do not meet the}} above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.|$|E
50|$|Flesh tunnels are {{fashioned}} {{from a broad}} range of materials, including surgical steel, titanium, Pyrex glass, silicone, acrylic glass, bone, horn, amber, bamboo, stone, and wood. Flesh tunnels, like flesh plugs, may feature a decorative inlay or semi-precious stones. Some flesh tunnels have flares to keep the jewellery from falling out. If there are no flares, grooves may be cut near the edges to allow rubber or silicone o-rings to hold the jewellery in place. The back of the flesh tunnel may also screw off. A flesh tunnel may also have an internally threaded backing, as <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> pieces can rip freshly stretched ears.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a navel curve or curve, so named because of their curvature. A curved barbell is {{mechanically}} identical to a straight barbell, except for being curved. Curvature on a curved barbell can range from almost straight to circular, with some barbells actually being spiral, with the ends overlapping but separated to allow the insertion of the jewelry. A variation on this design is a J-bar, a slightly curved barbell (sometimes {{referred to as a}} bananabell or banana barbell) with a 90 degree bend near one end, used in vertical navel piercings to position the decorative end of the jewelry more appropriately. They can be either internally threaded or <b>externally</b> <b>threaded.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The spoke nipple is a headed {{cylinder}} with threading on {{the inside}} through part of its length (there is an unthreaded lead-in nearest the [...] "flats"). Traditionally, the nipples fit in holes in the rim, so {{that the head of}} the nipple is on the outermost part of the rim, while {{the other end of the}} nipple points inwards towards the hub. Many different types of nipples are now available, including internal nipples that sit entirely within the rim and can only be adjusted by removing the tire, as well as <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> nipples that thread into the rim (such as those used by Mavic Ksyriums). The threading grasps the spoke, so turning it increases or decreases tension in the spoke and influences the position of the hub relative to the rim.|$|E
50|$|<b>Externally</b> <b>{{threaded}}</b> inserts have threads on {{the outside}} and inside of the insert. The insert is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some inserts tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole. It is then anchored by various means, such as a nylon locking element. Inserts that are anchored via Loctite are more commonly known by the trademarked name E-Z Lok. A thin walled solid bushing insert by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the insert in place. Key locking inserts, more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the insert. Inserts that are self-tapping and lock via friction are more commonly known by the trademarked names Tap-lok or Speedserts.|$|E
5000|$|So {{named because}} {{the shaft of}} the bar has threads at both ends to allow beads with {{receiving}} threads to be attached. Due to the potential damage or irritation to the piercing when the threads pass through when the jewelry is inserted or removed, this type of barbell has become less common, due to {{the popularity of the}} internally threaded barbell. This type of barbell is usually only used when the gauge of the bar is too small to allow it to be internally threaded, or in cheap, mass-produced body jewelry. Some higher-end manufacturers make <b>externally</b> <b>threaded</b> barbells with [...] "step-down threading", where the threaded section has a smaller diameter than the wearable section; these are fairly uncommon and usually internally threaded barbells are used in their place. Step-down threaded jewelry ends can be inserted into the blunt end of a hollow piercing needle, allowing for less irritation during initial placement than regular external barbells or even internally threaded barbells.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this paper}} {{presents}} the effect of material and blank dimension on the dimensions of external rolled threads. This paper will be helpful for the auto industry, {{one of the largest}} fasteners markets, that typically consumes between 2800 to 3100 fasteners in the assembly of an average family vehicle. <b>Externally</b> <b>threaded</b> fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined. The size of the blank is dependent on material, surface finish, type of threads etc. This paper describes the effect of blank material and dimensions on nominal diameter of external rolled threads. The work has been carried out at M/s Gayatri Auto Industries on Master Reciprocating Dies Thread Rolling Machine using HSS die. Mild Steel (C 15), EN- 8 (C 40), and EN- 47 (Spring Steel) materials have been taken as blank material for the analysis to produce M 8 x 1. 25 6 g threads. The result indicates that the variation on surface roughness, carbon percentage and dimension of blank affects significantly the nominal diameter and PCD of threads.
