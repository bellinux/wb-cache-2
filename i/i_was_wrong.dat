25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{disliked the}} unusual design, however, and criticized the {{reliance}} on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for Artforum, critic Richard Hennessy described a [...] "shocking fun-house atmosphere" [...] and [...] "aura of ancient Roman patronage". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design {{when it was first}} unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: [...] "I am forced to admit that you are right and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong!</b> The building is a masterpiece." ...|$|E
5000|$|Goody {{initially}} {{denied that}} her comments were racist: [...] "She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing I {{could think of}} was Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It was not to offend any Indian out there." [...] On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty could be seen as racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said:I know that things that <b>I</b> don't think <b>are</b> necessarily racist ... could <b>be</b> ...

I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> I was foolish."

500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E
500|$|Walpole was a keen music {{lover and}} when in 1920 {{he heard a}} new tenor at the Proms he was much {{impressed}} and sought him out. Lauritz Melchior {{became one of the}} most important friendships of his life, and Walpole did much to foster the singer's budding career. Wagner's son Siegfried engaged Melchior for the Bayreuth Festival in 1924 and succeeding years. Walpole attended, and met Adolf Hitler, then recently released from prison after an attempted putsch. Hitler was a protégé of Siegfried's wife Winifred, and was known in Bayreuth as [...] "one of Winnie's lame ducks." [...] Walpole later admitted that he had both despised and liked him – [...] "both emotions that time has proved <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> to indulge". This and future visits to Bayreuth were complicated by the fact that Winifred Wagner fell in love with Walpole, and attached herself so firmly to him that rumours began to spread.|$|E

500|$|A devout Catholic, and {{politically}} social democratic, Logiest decided {{early on to}} favour the Hutu in his decision making in the country. This was partly for security reasons, as Logiest claimed that the Hutu would continue the violence {{as long as the}} Tutsi remained in power, but he also strongly in favour of the revolution on democratic grounds; he saw it as the opportunity for the [...] "oppressed" [...] Hutu peasants to rise up against the Tutsi ruling class. He later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "Some among my assistants thought that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> in being so partial against the Tutsi and that I was leading Rwanda on a road towards democratisation whose end was distant and uncertain"; but he defended his actions, saying [...] "it was probably the desire to put down the morgue and expose the duplicity of a basically oppressive and unjust aristocracy". After Kigeli and UNAR's retaliation against the Hutu, Logiest and his troops prioritised the protection of Hutu leaders (including Gitera).|$|E
500|$|Gil Kaufman of MTV {{spoke of}} the snippet's composition, proclaiming {{that it had a}} [...] "thumping R beat and soaring strings".

[...] Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, [...] "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire that keeps me warm / I can't make it another day." [...] The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between [...] "Another Day" [...] and [...] "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, [...] "I walked away but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> / You're the one that keeps me strong / You're the fire that keeps me warm / How will I get through this storm?" ...|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{in prison}} LaRouche {{released}} {{claims that he}} was tortured {{as part of an}} assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia's 10th Congressional District in 1990 and for U.S. President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota was televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Wrong,</b> to his experience with LaRouche. Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and {{on more than one occasion}} LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, [...] "to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak." [...] LaRouche also befriended Richard Miller, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that [...] "...in effect, George H. W. Bush put me in the jug, and Bill Clinton got me out".|$|E
500|$|TV Overmind Carissa Pavlica {{commented on}} Tom Pelphrey guest role saying [...] "I adored Guiding Light and {{considering}} the roles Tom Pelphrey (my beloved Jonathan from GL) gets after his run as the bad-boy, I immediately suspected {{he would be}} the killer. Turned out <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> but he was still a class A jerk". Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up so fast and furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell you. She added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know. Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E
