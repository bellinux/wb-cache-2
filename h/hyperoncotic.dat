40|$|Preferential {{expansion}} of the plasma volume by infusion of salt-poor <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin solution decreases sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule. The present micropuncture studies test the thesis that albumin infusion depresses proximal reabsorption by an effect unrelated to {{expansion of}} the plasma volume, perhaps due to an effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on proximal sodium reabsorption. Infusion of salt-poor <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin significantly decreased plasma ionized calcium, increased immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) in plasma, decreased sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule, and increased phosphate clearance. In contrast, infusions of albumin, in which the ionized calcium was restored to normal plasma levels, had no significant effect on ionized calcium, iPTH, proximal reabsorption, or phosphate clearance in intact dogs. Similarly, in parathyroidectomized animals given a constant replacement infusion of PTH, albumin infusion had no significant effect on proximal reabsorption or phosphate clearance. Plasma volume was markedly expanded following albumin infusion in all groups of dogs. These findings (a) indicate that PTH {{plays a significant role}} in the decrease in sodium reabsorption by the renal proximal tubule after salt-poor <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin infusion, and (b) dissociate preferential {{expansion of the}} plasma volume from decreases in sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule...|$|E
30|$|Our {{study was}} the first to analyze the impact of treatment. <b>Hyperoncotic</b> serum albumin was {{associated}} with ARF whereas 4 % albumin had no impact. This is in accordance with previously published data in other settings. Preeclampsia may induce a hypovolemic state caused by hypoalbuminemia and capillary permeability dysfunction. The degree of hypovolemia increases significantly at the ascitis state. Albumin is often used in that situation although it has never demonstrated any benefit in terms of maternal or fetal morbidity [27],[28]. Outside of pregnancy, the use of <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin seemed associated with development of acute renal failure [29]. The inferred mechanisms are the decrease in filtration pressure and a direct nephrotoxicity. Further studies are required to clarify that point in the postpartum setting.|$|E

Reabsorption in adjacent proximal tubules was studied using free-flow techniques, with initial collections obtained during normal blood perfusion, recollections during experimental microperfusion, and in some tubules, repeat recollections after microperfusion and spontaneous resumption of blood perfusion. Colloid-free perfusion resulted in a uniform inhibition of proximal reabsorption (absolute and fractional). Despite identical techniques, substitution of isoncotic and <b>hyperoncotic</b> perfusates resulted, on average, in unchanged and increased rates of reabsorption, respectively.

40|$|Introduction Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) -based volume {{replacement}} {{solutions are}} currently {{the most frequently}} used artificial colloids. Adverse drug reactions of HES are HES-induced coagulopathy that includes disturbed fibrin polymerization and impaired platelet function, as well as an acquired HES-induced von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1. Changes of HES formulas relating to molecular weight, degree of substitution and concentration could decrease the impairment of coagulation. Modern HES preparations are of middle molecular weight, low substituted, and mainly isooncotic. Older <b>hyperoncotic</b> HES were associated with improved haemodynamics and oxygen transport, but also with higher impairment of coagulation. Introduction of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions substituting the classic carrier solution of 0. 9 % sodium chloride attenuated the metabolic disturbances; a benefit concerning the coagulopathy is controversially discussed in the literature. The aim of the study presented was a systematic analysis of the in vitro effect on coagulation that is exerted by concentration and carrier solution of modern, middle molecular weight, low substituted HES in an in vitro model of stepwise increasing haemodilution. Besides, the in vitro reproducibility of blood group dependence of HES-induced, acquired von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1 was investigated. Materials and Methods Both iso- and <b>hyperoncotic,</b> non-balanced and electrolyte-balanced HES solutions of identical molecular weight (MW 130, 000 Da) and comparable degree of substitution (DS 0. 4 or 0. 42, respectively) were investigated in an in vitro model of haemodilution. Citrated blood was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers of blood groups 0 or A, and the effect of 20 %, 40 % and 60 % haemodilution was measured by conventional coagulation parameters, by von-Willebrand-parameters and by dynamic coagulation parameters of activated thromboelastometry. As conventional coagulation parameters a full blood count, measurement of ionized calcium, prothrombin time ratio in percent (“Quick-value”), activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT), factor VIII (FVIII) as well as quantitative and qualitative assessment of von-Willebrand-Factor (vWF) was performed. In thromboelastometry, parameters CT, CFT and MCF of the EXTEM assay, and MCF of the FIBTEM assay were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests. Results Concerning the effect of the concentration of HES, in this study at some dilutional degrees higher Quick-value and FVIII, and lower aPTT, respectively, were measured after dilution with <b>hyperoncotic</b> HES. No benefit could be demonstrated concerning the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters by <b>hyperoncotic</b> HES formulas. In thromboelastometry a higher impairment of coagulation by <b>hyperoncotic</b> HES was seen. Concerning the effect of the carrier solution, in conventional coagulation parameters significantly higher levels of ionized calcium, less impaired Quick- and aPTT-values as well as higher FVIII levels were found after dilution with electrolyte-balanced HES. Neither could a benefit of electrolyte-balanced HES on the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters be demonstrated, nor could the benefit on thromboelastometry, that had been described in previous studies, be reproduced. With regard to the levels of vWF, the associated FVIII, and the functional activity of vWF, blood group 0 had lower values compared to blood group A, at baseline and during stepwise haemodilution. This is in line with the existing literature. Considering the physiologically lower baseline levels, a higher extent of impairment for blood group 0 by modern HES could not be demonstrated by quantitative assessments, although a higher extent of functional impairment could not be excluded. Discussion and conclusion There is a discrepancy between the observed effects of higher concentrated HES that impaired conventional coagulation parameters to a lesser, but thromboelastometry parameters to a higher degree than isooncotic HES. This discrepancy is in line with previous studies, and can be due to an in vitro measurement artifact by turbidimetric measurements. In case of turbidimetric measurements of coagulation parameters, i. e. optical measurements, colloids like HES can cause falsely-elevated readings, so mechanical measurements may be a favorable alternative. Given the lack of valid in vivo data and considering the higher impairment of coagulation demonstrated by thromboelastometry, high-volume resuscitation using a <b>hyperoncotic</b> HES should be restrictively applied. The discussion on potential benefits of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions in HES-induced dilutional coagulopathy, that had been controversial before, was amended by a significant impact on ionized calcium and calcium-dependent coagulation parameters, e. g. Quick-value, aPTT, FVIII and von-Willebrand-factor parameters, in vitro. As measured by thromboelastometry, HES-induced coagulopathy did not differ between balanced and non-balanced carrier solution. In conclusion, this in vitro study cannot confirm a benefit of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions on the coagulation system. To test the hypothesis of an in vitro artifact and for clarity concerning the impact of calcium-containing carrier solutions on levels of ionized calcium in vivo – with functioning calcium homeostasis – clinical studies investigating levels of ionized calcium and FVIII are needed...|$|E
40|$|Micropuncture {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that variation in peritubular oncotic pressure influences net transport of fluid out of the proximal tubule. The present in vitro studies on isolated perfused rabbit proximal convoluted tubules were designed to examine whether protein concentration gradient must act across the peritubular capillary membrane to influence reabsorption, or whether it can exert a direct effect across the tubular basement membrane 71 proximal tubules were perfused with ultrafiltrate made isosmolal to bathing fluids, the latter having identical electrolyte composition as the perfusing ultrafiltrate, but adjusted to three oncotic pressures: hypooncotic, protein 0. 0 g/ 100 ml; control isooncotic serum, protein 6. 4 g/ 100 ml; and <b>hyperoncotic,</b> protein 12. 5 g/ 100 ml. Net volume flux (nl/mm per min), net Na flux (nEq/mm per min), unidirectional Na flux from bath to lumen (nEq/mm per min), and passive permeability coefficient (× 10 - 5 cm/sec) for Na (PNa), urea (Purea), and sucrose (Psucrose) were determined using isotopic techniques. When the bath was hypooncotic, there was (as compared with isooncotic serum) a significant decrease in net volume (38 %) and net sodium (40 %) flux, but no change in PNa, Purea, or transtubular potential; however, Psucrose increased significantly (78 %).

30|$|Induction of {{the flow}} phase with PAL-treatment implies {{vascular}} refilling from the interstitium and subsequent removal of fluids from the body producing a net negative fluid balance. In this context, addition of small volume resuscitation with <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin to a fluid removal regimen resulted in a greater negative fluid balance while maintaining better hemodynamic stability [21]. Moreover, restoration of colloid osmotic pressure in absence of elevated hydrostatic pressure may prevent further interstitial edema formation [41, 42]. Accordingly, hypoproteinemia is highly predictive of positive fluid balance and development of ALI in patients with sepsis [43]. In view of PAL-treatment as a therapy for capillary leak, beneficial effects of albumin on the microcirculation may be of particular interest, attenuating capillary permeability and pulmonary inflammation [44 – 47].|$|E

Finally, a furosemide drip was initiated with an intravenous loading dose of 60 mg, followed by a continuous infusion at 60 mg/h for the first 4 h and 5 - 10 mg/h thereafter, according to hemodynamic tolerance.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} different {{factors of}} posttraumatic changes following the experimental model of brain injury, {{the so called}} Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) device. Posttraumatic impairment of microcirculation is described, which is most prominent at 4 hours following trauma. The multifactorial cause of decreased cerebral blood flow was visualized by intravital microscopy using the orthogonal polarized spectral (OPS) imaging. Microthrombosis, cellular adhesions and vasospasm was observed at 4 hours after trauma. Using microdialysis and bioluminescence measurements energetic impairment showed a heterogeneous pattern, which was most prominent at 6 hours following CCI and was widely spread also in distant areas to the contusion. Posttraumatic immunological changes showed a mixed local increase of pro- as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines only at 4 hours. However, cellular infiltration by neutrophils was seen at later time points and was most obvious at 24 hours after trauma. In therapeutic studies the <b>hyperoncotic,</b> hyperosmolar agent HyperHAES was used to influence impaired microcirculation. This treatment protocol showed an enhancement of regional cerebral blood flow in the pericontusional area and resulted in a decrease of contusion volume. An anti-oxidative agent, n-acetylcysteine, revealed no significant changes in, cerebral blood flow, posttraumatic brain oedema or contusion volume. Using Tacrolimus as anti-inflammatory drug {{a significant decrease in}} immune cell invasion/ activation was observed at 72 hours after trauma, however, without influencing the contusion volume. As a result the significance of impaired microcirculation is emphasized in this study, which can be treated using a <b>hyperoncotic,</b> hyperosmolar agent. Investigations of the drugs efficacy using other models of traumatic brain injury, like the fluid percussion and the weight drop model, are recommended before clinical testing. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory treatment following brain injury...|$|E
3000|$|Hydroxyethyl starch, an {{artificial}} polymer, {{is derived from}} amylopectin, which is a highly branched chain of glucose molecules obtained from waxy maize or potatoes. Conservation from degradation and water solubility are achieved by hydroxyethylation of the glucose units. HES solutions are available in several preparations and vary in concentration, molecular weight, molar substitution, C 2 /C 2 ratio, solvent, and pharmacologic profile. Although small HES molecules (< 50 - 60 kD) are eliminated rapidly by glomerular filtration, larger molecules are hydrolyzed to smaller fractions and are partially taken up in the reticuloendothelial system. Although this storage seems not to impair the mononuclear phagocytic system, {{it is remarkable that}} low molecular weight HES accumulates less compared with high molecular weight HES [42]. Negative effects of high molecular HES on the coagulation system are well described. Preparations > 200 kD lead to a reduction of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, causing a decreased platelet adhesion. Low molecular weight preparations, such as HES 130 / 0.4, have only minimal effects on coagulation. HES in balanced solution increases the expression of activated platelet GP IIb/IIIa, indicating an improved hemostasis [43, 44]. Focusing on kidney function, an 80 % rate of [...] "osmotic nephrosis-like lesions" [...] and impaired renal function were reported in kidney transplant recipients after administration of HES 200 / 0.62 to brain-dead organ donors [45, 46]. In septic patients, usage of 10 % HES 200 / 0.5 correlated with a higher incidence of renal failure compared with crystalloids [47]. Admittedly, HES was administered without regard to exclusion criteria and dose limitations in this study. The most likely pathomechanism of renal impairment by colloids is the induction of urine hyperviscosity by infusing <b>hyperoncotic</b> agents in dehydrated patients. Glomerular filtration of <b>hyperoncotic</b> molecules causes a hyperviscous urine and results in stasis of the tubular flow [48]. Elevated plasma oncotic pressure, regardless of which genesis, is known to cause acute renal failure since more than 20 years [49]. Based on this pathogenesis, all <b>hyperoncotic</b> colloids may induce renal damage, whereas iso-oncotic tetra starch solutions, such as 6 % HES 130 / 0.4, seem not to impair renal function [41, 46]. After administration of extremely high application rates (up to 66 liters in 21 days) in patients with severe head injury, no impairment of renal function was observed [50]. In contrast to results of the VISEP study [47], the SOAP study, which included more than 3, 000 critically ill septic patients treated with pentastarch and tetrastarch solutions, also showed no higher risk for renal failure [51]. Hydroxyethyl starch was administered in much lower amounts (13 vs. 70 ml/kg) and for a shorter period in the SOAP study. There is evidence that HES also modulates inflammation. Synthetic colloids inhibit neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium and neutrophil infiltration of the lung [52, 53].|$|E

By mixing 6 % dextran with 0. 9 % saline in 1 : 1 proportion a 3 % dextran solution was obtained which was nearly isoncotic in our dogs. The most likely explanation for the discrepancy is that the 6 % solution contains a high proportion of molecules of lower molecular weight resulting in a greater oncotic pressure than predicted {{on the basis of the}} average molecular weight. In addition, this leads to a rapid loss of this solute from the blood.

Anoxic injury was consistently attenuated or abolished if reabsorptive transport was decreased with ouabain or furosemide or by halting the glomerular filtration rate {{with the use of}} a <b>hyperoncotic</b> medium (nonfiltering kidney).

40|$|Modulation of c-fos and egr- 1 {{expression}} in the isolated perfused kidney by agents that alter tubular work. The isolated perfused rat kidney provides a model of selective hypoxia to the medullary thick ascending limb. To investigate the relationship between immediate early gene expression {{and the extent of}} hypoxic damage, we determined expression of the immediate early genes (IEG) c-fos and egr- 1 in isolated perfused kidneys during standard perfusion and after various measures shown previously to be protective. mRNA levels of c-fos and egr- 1 were markedly increased in kidneys after 90 minutes of standard perfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing albumin. Gene expression was most prominent in the outer medulla followed by papilla and cortex, a pattern reflected by the immunohistochemical demonstration of a prominent accumulation of both egr- 1 and c-fos polypetides mainly in the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL). Protective measures known to minimize morphological damage to the mTAL, including <b>hyperoncotic</b> perfusion, perfusion with glycine, or perfusion with a mixture of amino acids, decreased mRNA levels of c-fos and egr- 1 in the outer medulla (by 50 % and 35 %, respectively) and the papilla (by 60 and 30 %, respectively). Renal cortex showed only minor changes. In contrast, prevention of tubular transport by perfusion with 1 mM ouabain increased mRNA levels of c-fos and egr- 1 in the outer medulla by 100 % and 60 %, respectively. Ouabain also dramatically increased mRNA levels of both IEGs in two lines of cultured renal epithelial cells. Changes in the level and distribution of the protein products of these IEGs were not detectable in perfused kidneys by immunohistochemistry. Hypoxic injury of the kidney stimulates IEG expression {{even in the absence of}} reperfusion. Protection against hypoxic injury in the mTAL correlates with suppression of IEG mRNA levels when protection is provided by amino acids or <b>hyperoncotic</b> perfusion, but not when provided by inhibition of Na,K-ATPase, which stimulates IEG expression. We conclude that diminished IEG expression is not a necessary concomitant of protection against hypoxic injury...|$|E

To directly evaluate this possibility, micropuncture of the papillary collecting duct of young rats was performed during hydropenia and Ringer loading. The possibility of heterogeneity of nephron function was evaluated during Ringer and <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin loading by comparing the delivery of sodium {{to the end of the}} distal tubule of superficial nephrons with papillary base delivery. During hydropenia (n = 14), sodium delivery to the base averaged 0. 95 % of the filtered sodium load and reabsorption along the collecting duct was noted from base to tip in each collection pair averaging 0. 80 % of the filtered load. During Ringer loading, sodium delivery to the base was markedly greater than in hydropenia, 11. 8 vs. 0. 95 % of the filtered load (P less than 0. 001). Yet, sodium reabsorption was also much greater, 6 vs. 0. 8 % (P less than 0. 001). In 13 paired collections, during Ringer loading, sodium delivery to the papillary base, 12. 2 % of the filtered load, was consistently greater than late distal tubular delivery from superficial nephrons. 8 % (P less than 0. 005). In contrast, reabsorption of sodium from late distal tubule to papillary base was found during albumin infusion, 6. 2 vs. 3. 1 % (P less than 0. 001). Therefore, these studies demonstrate that: (a) the delivery of sodium to and reabsorption along the papillary collecting duct were markedly greater during Ringer loading than in hydropenia; (b) the amount of sodium delivered to the papillary base was greater than the delivery to the end of the distal tubule of superficial nephrons during Ringer loading, suggesting that deeper nephrons deliver more sodium to the collecting duct in this setting; and (c) the difference in sodium excretion between Ringer loading and <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin infusion is due to events occurring between the late distal tubule of superficial nephrons and the base of the papillary collecting duct...|$|E
40|$|Role of peritubular {{capillary}} {{forces in}} the renal action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Micropuncture study was performed in Munich–Wistar rats to assess peritubular capillary Starling forces in renal superficial cortex during suppression of proximal fluid reabsorption by carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Administration of benzolamide (2 mg/kg/hr, i. v., Group 1, N = 7 rats) caused not only reduction in absolute rate of proximal fluid reabsorption (APR, from 26. 7 ± 4. 0 nl/min to 17. 7 ± 3. 6, P < 0. 001), but also an increase in peritubular transcapillary hydraulic–pressure difference (from 10. 0 ± 0. 5 mm Hg to 15. 2 ± 0. 5, P < 0. 001). In a separate group of seven rats (Group 2), these parameters did not change significantly without benzolamide treatment. In Group 1 rats, {{an attempt was made}} to nullify the benzolamide–induced reduction in the peritubular capillary net reabsorptive forces by infusing <b>hyperoncotic</b> high–hematocrit blood. Following this treatment, while benzolamide administration was continued, values for APR returned to levels (25. 6 ± 4. 8 nl/min) nearly identical to those measured prior to benzolamide administration, in association with a rise in peritubular transcapillary oncotic pressure difference. A separate group of six rats treated in a fashion identical to that of Group 1 showed continued suppression of carbonic anhydrase activity following blood infusion as indicated by low levels of whole kidney bicarbonate reabsorption rate. Peritubular capillary reabsorption coefficient was calculated based on the measured values for Starling forces in Group 1 and were unaffected throughout the study. Continued benzolamide administration alone without the treatment of <b>hyperoncotic</b> blood did not change APR significantly (Group 3, N = 7 rats). These results indicate that administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor causes a depression of peritubular capillary water uptake forces, and the maintenance of this reduced peritubular uptake forces is a requirement for the suppressive influence of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor on proximal water reabsorption to be fully expressed in vivo...|$|E
30|$|Under {{physiologic}} conditions, albumin is {{the molecule}} mainly accountable for intravascular osmotic pressure {{and should be}} an ideal colloid to restore protein loss from the vasculature. However, as a natural colloid, albumin may cause severe allergic reaction and immunologic complications. Current date concerning albumin use to treat hypovolemia mainly originate from critically ill patients. A Cochrane review of 30 randomized, controlled trials, including 1, 419 patients with hypovolemia, showed no evidence for a reduced mortality comparing albumin to crystalloid volume resuscitation. Usage of albumin may contrariwise even increase mortality [38]. More recently, the SAFE Study, including 6, 997 patients and comparing albumin to normal saline fluid resuscitation, found neither beneficial effects nor an increased mortality in the albumin group. Additionally, no differences in days of mechanical ventilation or need for renal-replacement therapy were observed [39]. In contrast to isooncotic albumin, which does not influence the outcome of critically ill patients, treatment with <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin increased mortality [40]. Therefore, administration of isooncotic albumin may be justifiable in particular cases but not as a routine strategy for volume resuscitation.|$|E
30|$|It {{is common}} belief that albumin {{solutions}} do force excess tissue water {{back into the}} endovascular space by creating a <b>hyperoncotic</b> effect. Surprisingly, this has never been evidenced [32]! Albumin infusion may even promote extracellular fluid overload without improving hypovolemia in sepsis complicating advanced cirrhosis or diabetes [33]. Any beneficial effect of albumin on patient outcome remains controversial. Data from the SAFE study [34] and a systematic review [35] showed {{that the use of}} albumin-containing solutions for the resuscitation of patients with sepsis was associated with lower mortality and did not impair renal function compared with other fluid resuscitation regimens. The recently published ALBIOS trial failed to show a mortality benefit in patients with severe sepsis who were fluid resuscitated with albumin and crystalloids as compared with crystalloids alone [36]. However, a post hoc analysis showed a significantly lower 90 -day mortality in a subgroup of 1121 patients with septic shock treated with albumin [36]. Moreover, a recent review highlighted that ALBIOS patients who received albumin needed less vasopressive support and achieved a significantly better fluid balance [37]. Still, many uncertainties prevail as to the potential benefit, indications, and cost-effectiveness of albumin [38, 39].|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{major problem}} in {{clinical}} lung transplantation is the shortage of donor lungs. Only about 20 % of donor lungs are accepted for transplantation. A method to evaluate and recondition lungs ex vivo has been tested on donor lungs that have been rejected for transplantation. METHODS: The donor lungs were reconditioned ex vivo in an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit with STEEN solution (Vitrolife AB, Kungsbacka, Sweden) mixed with erythrocytes. The <b>hyperoncotic</b> solution dehydrates edematous lung tissue. Functional evaluations were performed with deoxygenated perfusate by varying the inspired fraction of oxygen. After the reconditioning, the lungs were kept immersed at 8 degrees C in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until transplantation was performed. RESULTS: Six of nine initially rejected donor lungs were reconditioned to acceptable function, and in six recipients, double lung transplantation was performed. Three-month survival was 100 %. One patient has since died due to sepsis after 95 days, and one due to rejection after 9 months. Four recipients are alive and well without any sign of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 24 months after the transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The result {{from the present study}} is promising, and we continue to transplant reconditioned lungs...|$|E
40|$|Human albumin (HA) {{is widely}} used for volume {{replacement}} or correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The value of HA in the clinical setting continues to be controversial, and {{it is unclear whether}} in today’s climate of cost consciousness, there is still a place for such a highly priced substance. It is therefore appropriate to update our knowledge of the value of HA. With the exception of women in early pregnancy, there appears to be few indications for the use of HA to correct hypovolaemia. Some studies of traumatic brain injury and intensive care patients suggest negative effects on outcome and organ function of (<b>hyperoncotic)</b> HA. Modern synthetic colloids appear to be a cheaper alternative for maintaining colloid oncotic pressure. The value of using HA to correct hypoalbuminaemia has not been clearly justified. Theoretical and pharmacological benefits of HA, such as oxygen radical scavenging or binding of toxic substances, have not as yet been shown to have beneficial clinical consequences. Experimental data from cell lines or animals do not appear to mimic the clinical setting. Convincing data justifying the use of HA either for treating hypovolaemia or for correcting hypoalbuminaemia are still lacking. A restricted use of HA is recommended...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{address the}} issues of Prevention and Management of Acute Renal Failure in the ICU Patient, using the format of an International Consensus Conference. METHODS AND QUESTIONS: Five main {{questions}} formulated by scientific advisors were addressed by experts during a 2 -day symposium and a Jury summarized the available evidence: (1) Identification and definition of acute kidney insufficiency (AKI), this terminology being selected by the Jury; (2) Prevention of AKI during routine ICU Care; (3) Prevention in specific diseases, including liver failure, lung Injury, cardiac surgery, tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and elevated intraabdominal pressure; (4) Management of AKI, including nutrition, anticoagulation, and dialysate composition; (5) Impact of renal replacement therapy on mortality and recovery. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Jury recommended the use of newly described definitions. AKI significantly contributes to the morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients, and adequate volume repletion is of major importance for its prevention, though correction of fluid deficit will not always prevent renal failure. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids is effective and safe, and <b>hyperoncotic</b> solutions are not recommended because of their renal risk. Renal replacement therapy is a life-sustaining intervention that can provide a bridge to renal recovery; no method {{has proven to be}} superior, but careful management is essential for improving outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background. Patients with {{systemic}} sepsis {{develop a}} capillary leak syndrome, and serum 2 albumin concentration decreases. <b>Hyperoncotic</b> albumin infusion {{can be used}} for volume expansion in these patients, but the degree and duration of effect are not well described. We assessed volume expansion by albumin 20 % infusion and compared the retention of infused albumin in septic patients and healthy controls. Methods. We gave albumin 20 %, 200 ml as a rapid infusion to 70 patients with septic shock and 26 controls. Blood samples were taken before and 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after the infusion for measurement of serum albumin concentration and haematocrit. Haemodilution and the percentage of administered albumin remaining intravascularly at each time were calculated. Results. The mean proportion of the increase in albumin remaining at 4 h was 68. 5 (SD 10) % in septic patients and 79 (5) % in controls (P< 0. 001). The albumin 20 %, 200 ml caused a secondary ¯uid resorption and volume expansion maximal at 30 min, equivalent to a 430 ml infusion in septic patients and 500 ml in controls. Conclusions. After giving albumin, serum albumin concentrations decrease signi®cantly faster in septic patients than in healthy controls...|$|E
40|$|Renal sodium {{handling}} was {{studied in}} 23 children at three {{different stages of}} the minimal change nephrotic syndrome [...] the oedema forming state, proteinuric steady state, and remission. Clearances of inulin and para-aminohippuric acid and urinary sodium excretion were determined basally, after intravenous infusion of isotonic saline and <b>hyperoncotic</b> albumin, and after furosemide injection. Absolute and fractional basal sodium excretion were significantly lower in oedema forming patients than in proteinuric patients in steady state, and non-proteinuric patients. In contrast to proteinuric patients in steady state and non-proteinuric patients, the oedema forming patients {{failed to respond to}} isotonic saline infusion with increased sodium excretion. After diuretic blockade with furosemide, the fractional sodium excretion of the oedema forming patients increased to values no {{different from those of the}} non-proteinuric patients, whereas the fractional sodium excretion of the steady state patients increased to significantly higher values. The plasma aldosterone concentration was within normal limits in 11 of 14 proteinuric patients, and did not correlate with the basal sodium excretion. Thus, sodium retention in the minimal change nephrotic syndrome was found only in oedema forming patients, and since this is not related to the plasma aldosterone concentration it may be caused by an intrarenal mechanism, probably sited in distal parts of the nephron...|$|E
