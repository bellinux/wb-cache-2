[...] Three previous cases were [...] "particularly instructive" [...] in deciding the case; the cases all involved taxes on gross receipts that the Supreme Court struck down for posing the risk of multiple taxation. The majority rejected arguments that those cases involved gross receipts rather than net income and corporations rather than individuals. The majority also rejected the Comptroller's argument that individuals should be distinguished from corporations {{for the purposes of this}} case because individuals can vote to change the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> scheme. In the majority's view, [...] "the notion that the victims of such discrimination have a complete remedy at the polls is fanciful" [...] and that [...] "it is even more farfetched to suggest that natural persons with out-of-state income are better able to influence state." [...] They also found [...] "no merit" [...] in the Comptroller's argument that the statute is constitutional because it was not intended to discriminate against interstate commerce because the Commerce Clause [...] "regulates effects, not motives, and it does not require courts to inquire into voters' or legislators' reasons for enacting a law that has a discriminatory effect." [...] The majority also criticized the primary dissent's arguments—that the Dormant Commerce Clause does not limit the States' sovereign power to tax income of their residents, wherever earned—as [...] "confusing what a State may do without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with what it may do without violating the Commerce Clause." ...|$|E

Nonprofits that are 2 ̆ 2 charitable organizations 2 ̆ 2 under § 501 (c) (3) {{of the tax}} code may receive donations from individuals who are allowed to deduct their donations from their income for tax purposes. We argue that the law should not link tax benefits to corporate form in this way. There may be good arguments for recognizing the nonprofit form and good arguments for providing tax subsidies to charities or donors to charities, but there is no good argument for making those tax subsidies available only to charities that adopt the nonprofit form. Consequently, the 2 ̆ 2 for-profit charity 2 ̆ 2 may well be a desirable institution. Currently, no such entity exists, but the reason is surely <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> treatment; the charitable activities of many commercial firms suggest that in the absence of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> treatment for-profit charities would flourish.

40|$|In this Article, I seek {{to respond}} to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{overture}} with a treatment of of subsidies under the dormant Commerce Clause that moves progressively from the general to the specific. Part I examines key Supreme Court cases to show that the basic question of whether state business subsidies are constitutional remains open and important. Part II then turns to how that question should be resolved, focusing on whether subsidies are fairly distinguishable from ostensibly equivalent, and concededly unlawful, <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> relief. The thrust of Part II is that both precedent and policy support the traditional, pre-West Lynn Creamer 2 ̆ 2 view that state subsidies almost always comport with the dormant Commerce Clause principle. In particular, Part II emphasizes that four considerations-rooted in form, fairness, federalism, and political processes-render subsidies less threatening to Commerce Clause values than economically comparable tax deductions, credits, and exemptions. Part III then addresses the major question that Part II leaves open: How should courts distinguish the ordinary subsidy that is constitutional from the exceptional subsidy that is not? Part III suggests that none of the opinions in West Lynn Creamery-in which an exceptional subsidy was struck downoffers much useful guidance on this critical question. As a result, Part IV offers an alternative analytical framework for distinguishing the constitutional grant-in-aid from the unconstitutional assault upon our 2 ̆ 2 federal free trade unit. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 In essence, this proposal calls upon courts to draw the line between permissible and impermissible subsidies by focusing on the same four factors already identified in Part II to distinguish ordinary subsidies from <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> breaks as a general matter. Accordingly, Part IV advocates an approach that asks whether the challenged subsidy-because of its linkage to a particular tax-shares the essential constitutional defects of a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> break. Using the four factors, courts would consider the following: (1) whether, consistent with conventional property-based notions of fairness, the subsidy merely permits state residents to reap where they have sown; (2) whether invalidation of the subsidy frustrates the state 2 ̆ 7 s federalism based interest in experimenting with responses to distinctive local needs; (3) whether the same political dynamics that unduly encourage adoption and retention of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tax</b> relief (i. e., reduced visibility, heightened risks of entrenchment, lowered administrative costs, and the like) mark the challenged subsidy scheme; and (4) whether the subsidy is part of a program that resembles in form a protective tariff or kindred types of unconstitutional discriminatory taxation...|$|E
