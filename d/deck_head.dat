2500|$|Israeli Navy {{warships}} flanked the flotilla and {{an aircraft}} flew overhead after it ignored Israeli instructions. Speedboats were prevented from approaching the Mavi Marmara by throwing broken dishes and metal chains. The other ships were boarded from speedboats. Israeli forces {{were met by}} passive resistance on five of the ships, but clashes broke out aboard the Mavi Marmara. A team of 15 Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos abseiled onto the ships from helicopters with paintball guns, plastic bullet riot dispersal handguns, and hidden firearms. The first team commander was thrown over the <b>deck</b> <b>head</b> down, abducted and stabbed, along with a second commando, and a third was grabbed off the rope. They were taken to an inside room and medically treated by the activists, who left the knife in the commander's stomach. A stun grenade from the abducted soldiers was thrown at the commandos and a handgun was allegedly taken from one soldiers and fired by an activist, who was intercepted. The commandos were ordered to use live fire. In the melee, five activists were killed, and two, wounded by rubber bullets, died a short time later. According to the Israeli timeline video, within 5 minutes the roof was secured, {{with the assistance of}} an extra 15 man commando unit. Only 15 minutes later the commandos began the ship takeover with live ammunition and a third team of fighters. The soldier's captors escaped, and the Israeli commander pulled the knife out of his body and jumped overboard along with a second soldier. The third, with severe head injury was left and found by his comrades later. The raid ended with nine activists killed, and dozens injured. A UNHRC fact-finding mission described six of the nine passengers' deaths as [...] "summary execution" [...] by the Israeli commandos. A BBC documentary concluded that Israeli forces had faced a violent premeditated attack by a group of hardcore IHH activists, who intended to orchestrate a political act to put pressure on Israel. The programme was criticised as [...] "biased" [...] by critics of Israel and the PSC (Palestine Solidarity Campaign) questioned why the IDF boarded the ship at night if it had peaceful intention. Seven Israeli commandos were injured in the skirmish. After seizing control of the ships, Israeli forces towed them to Ashdod and detained the passengers. Both sides place responsibility for the bloodshed on the other, and accounts of the events vary.|$|E

60|$|The grapnels were thrown, and {{the sailors}} and Frenchmen leapt {{on to her}} <b>deck</b> <b>headed</b> by the three officers. Nearly half the pirates had been killed or wounded by the four {{discharges}} of grape. The remainder made but a poor fight of it, and were cut down to a man.|$|R
50|$|U-156 {{remained}} on the surface at the scene {{for the next two}} and a half days. At 11:30 on 15 September, she was joined by U-506, and a few hours later by both U-507, and the Italian submarine Cappellini. The four submarines, with lifeboats in tow and hundreds of survivors standing on their <b>decks,</b> <b>headed</b> for the African coastline and a rendezvous with the Vichy French surface warships that had set out from Senegal and Dahomey.|$|R

50|$|Several key {{components}} {{make up the}} main structure of most boats. The hull is the main structural component {{of the boat and}} provides buoyancy. The gunnel, which make up the sides of the boat, offers protection from water and makes the boat harder to sink. The roughly horizontal, chambered structures spanning the hull of the boat are referred to as the deck. A ship often has several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any. Above the deck are the superstructures. The underside of a deck is the <b>deck</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aquila′s planned air {{complement}} was 51 non-folding Reggiane Re.2001 OR fighter-bombers: 41 stowed in {{the hangar}} deck (including 15 {{suspended from the}} <b>deck</b> <b>head)</b> and 10 on the flight deck in a permanent deck park. A folding-wing version of the Re.2001 was planned, which would have increased the size of Aquila′s air group to 66 aircraft, but this never materialized. Only 10 Re.2001s were fully converted for carrier use. They were given tail hooks, RTG naval radio equipment and bomb racks for carrying 650 kg of bombs. They were also armed with two 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns mounted above the engine cowling. At least one Re.2001G was under test at Perugia as a naval torpedo bomber and was given a lengthened tail wheel strut to accommodate the added height of a torpedo suspended below the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Swan 65 sleeps 12 in four cabin spaces - two in {{forecastle}} in pipe cots, four in two forward cabins in pilot berths, {{three in}} main cabin in pilot berths and convertible settee, and {{three in a}} single and a double berth in the aft cabin. The saloon is roomy and not as dark as the narrow coach roof windows might suggest. Below the decks the sixty five offers very good combination of ocean going practicality and comfort as the berths are relatively small and secure, but the galley and chart table areas {{as well as the}} dining area are large, well equipped and very practical. A cut out in the bulkhead allows passing items and communication between the galley and the U- Shaped dining area. On some sixty fives this bulkhead is solid while on others it’s completely open with just a pillar running from {{the lower part of the}} bulkhead to the <b>deck</b> <b>head.</b> Forward of the saloon are two matching guest cabins with upper and lower single berths parallel to the centerline. Two forward heads with WC lavatory and shower. The owners stateroom in the aft is very spacious, having a double and a single berth, dressing table, cupboards and wardrobes and with WC lavatory and shower. The U-Shaped galley is large, well ventilated and equipped with double stainless steel sink, pressure water system, water heater, top opening refrigerator and deep freeze range/owen and ample storage areas. Throughout the history of Nautor the yard has provided their customers with a chance to choose the interior materials and lay-out to suit their liking which is why some of the interior arrangements deviate from the standard. Some yachts like Sayula II has even a small workshop fitted inside the boat to make repairs at sea easier.|$|E

60|$|The sails, {{which had}} been loosely furled, were dropped again, and the {{brigantine}} stole past the batteries, which saluted her with a rousing cheer, while the guns were worked with redoubled energy to keep down the fire of the pirates. The Cerf was swept with round shot and grape by the guns of the three piratical craft, but the distance to be traversed was so small, and the fire from the battery to which the pirates working their guns were exposed was so heavy, that the men fired wildly, and the Cerf suffered less than {{might have been expected}} while crossing the intervening two hundred yards of water. She was steered straight for the schooner, and as her bowsprit ran in between the pirate's masts the crew, who had been crouching forward, leapt down on to her <b>deck,</b> <b>headed</b> by their commander and the two midshipmen.|$|R

50|$|The Chief Mate, who is {{the second}} {{in command of the}} vessel, is often equated, in {{corporate}} terms, to a senior manager for the operations on board, as the Mate is in charge of a number of departmental functions.

60|$|But {{luckily for}} Mrs. Cox, {{everybody}} {{did not think}} as he did. He had gone from her ruthlessly, cruelly, falsely, with steps which sounded as though there were triumph in his escape, and left her seated alone near the skylights. But she was not long alone. As she looked after him along the <b>deck,</b> the <b>head</b> of Major Biffin appeared to her, emerging from the saloon stairs. She said nothing to herself now about barber's blocks or uncurled whiskers.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many of its}} contemporaries, the {{combustion}} chamber of the W-series engine was in {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, not the head, the head having only tiny recesses for the valves. This arrangement was achieved by combining a cylinder <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> that was not perpendicular to the bore with a crowned piston, which was a novel concept in American production engines of the day. As the piston approached top dead center, the angle of the crown combined with that of the <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> to form a wedge-shaped combustion chamber with a pronounced quench area. The spark plugs were inserted vertically into the quench area, which helped to produce a rapidly moving flame front for more complete combustion.|$|R
50|$|The Blue Crabs were {{owned by}} Opening Day Partners and Brooks Robinson, a former third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles from 1955 to 1977.

2500|$|The total {{complement}} (plērōma) {{of the ship}} was about 200.

5000|$|... ==History== The life of {{longboarding}} {{started in}} approximately the 1965s. The idea of longboarding originated from surfers in Hawaii {{that wanted to}} take their surfing hobby to land when the waves were too small to surf. Surfers then {{figured out a way}} of achieving their goal of bringing surfing to land by customizing their skateboards. They would grab a piece of thick plywood and shape it into a smaller version of a surfboard, then screw the trucks and wheels to the <b>decks</b> and <b>head</b> out to small hills to imitate the same moves they would do if they were out surfing.|$|R

50|$|A typical {{cassette}} adapter uses a single-sided writing {{tape head}} (similar to the recording {{head on a}} traditional tape deck) connected to a stereo minijack connector with a cord. The cord {{is connected to the}} device's output (or headphones) port and the electrical signal is converted into a magnetic signal by the head. This magnetic signal is then received by the tape <b>deck's</b> reading <b>head,</b> converted back into an electrical signal, and amplified by the sound system. Because most cassette adapters use a single-sided head, they only work in one direction. There are, however, some cassette adapters that have double-sided heads that work in either direction.|$|R

60|$|When next {{consciousness}} came, the tarry, salt {{smell of}} a ship was in my nostrils, and I {{knew that we were}} embarked.
