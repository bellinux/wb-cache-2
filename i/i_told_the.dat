5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at one moment quite heated. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> fire-brigade officer on my {{authority}} as Home Secretary {{that the house was}} to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} ago <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
6000|$|I took Sergeant Daw {{into the}} study, {{so that we}} should be alone when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>the</b> news. It {{surprised}} even his iron self-control when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>the</b> method of the waking. I was myself surprised in turn by his first words: ...|$|R

500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E
500|$|With the team's {{probation}} over, Farmer and {{the other}} three seniors played in their first [...] and only [...] postseason games in the 199192 season. After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 8074 in the second round; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O'Neal, who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee's Carlus Groves in his team's opening round victory. In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 8054 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, [...] "At the beginning of the season, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> four seniors 'this is the only thing I can give you. I can't give you any presents, but I can give you an SEC championship. We gave them a present they really deserved." ...|$|E

500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
500|$|The deposal {{prompted}} US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in {{a private}} meeting and threaten to cut off aid {{if they did not}} reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest days of my life...Today <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khac Suu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. Then we will see what happens." [...] However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khánh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon. Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi [...] "is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner. His only real objective is to continue the game." [...] Time described him as [...] "vain, ambitious, an inveterate intriguer". The New York Times described him as [...] "a coup specialist".|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Fasal {{was one of}} the few Iraqis who had {{expressed}} remorse about the situation. [...] It was a tragedy.

It does not mean that all the people here hate the British.|$|E

Pietersen was forced to complete the last year of his contract with Nottinghamshire, but [...] "didn't enjoy it at all".|$|E
2500|$|Eyewitness and ISM member Tom Dale, {{commenting on}} the 2012 verdict said: [...] "Whatever one thinks about the {{visibility}} from a D9 bulldozer, it is inconceivable {{that at some point}} the driver did not see her, given the distance from which he approached, while she stood, unmoving, in front of it. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court, just before she was crushed, Rachel briefly stood on top of the rolling mound of earth which had gathered in front of the bulldozer: her head was above the level of the blade, and just a few meters from the driver." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun.

So I chose an unbusy time and I had him walk {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> girl to close the door and said, [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E
2500|$|BOAA Chairman Michael Van Skaik responded, [...] "Men, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> lead pastors... that we {{are making}} real {{progress}} in addressing the serious reconciliation and unhealthy culture issues that {{have been part of}} Mars Hill Church for way too long. And we are...." [...] He further added that Acts 29 leaders did not contact Mars Hill before acting, and that Driscoll had [...] "changed his ways", and described Acts 29's actions as [...] "divisive." [...] Van Skaik also addressed the formal charges brought against Driscoll under the Mars Hill bylaws, writing [...] "the formal charges that were filed were serious, were taken seriously, and were not dismissed by the board lightly." ...|$|E
