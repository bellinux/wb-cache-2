Elsewhere, the hurricane had little impact, becoming extratropical on September5. After the third system, a series of four tropical depressions formed, but failed to become severe. The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica, Cuba, and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle. Overall, the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $170,000 (1917USD) in damage.|$|E

It degenerated into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E

5|$|On September13, 1934, a {{tropical}} cyclone <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western Caroline Islands.

The refurbishing initiative cost US$3.6 million, and was completed in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|The first {{system was}} spotted over the western Caribbean Sea on June12. It had a single-point track. Another {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed over the northern Atlantic Ocean on August5 and {{also had a}} single-point track. On September14, the next system was observed over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Several hours later, the storm struck Florida, causing severe damage to crops. Strong winds and rough seas were reported by ships and on land, particularly in Maine. The storm dissipated on September17. That same day, another tropical cyclone <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central Atlantic. The storm capsized the bark Phantom, though no one drowned. The next hurricane <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas on September22, but caused little damage, despite its proximity to land. On October21, the sixth and final system of the season was first observed over the Bahamas. The storm brought coastal flooding to Nassau and Bermuda later in its duration, before dissipating on October26.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} gradually <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea on November 1. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. By November 4, the system stalled {{to the north}} of Curaçao, which was followed by a turn to the northeast. Convection slowly organized as a surface circulation formed, and on November 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. Initially weak with only 20mph (32km/h) winds, the depression steadily organized as it moved northeastward, and a Reconnaissance Aircraft mission confirmed the existence of the cyclone on November 6 as it was located midway between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands Antilles. Late on the 6th, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Klaus while located a short distance south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2.

The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
