40|$|Ali Abad Tape is a prehistoric {{site in the}} {{northern}} part of Bukan city, Western Azerbaijan Province, North Western Iran. It was an unknown site until some potsherds mostly belonged to Kura-Araxes culture uncovered at the time <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> the <b>earth</b> in search <b>of</b> fresh water by residents. The sherds were parallel to most excavated sites in the west and northwestern Iran known as Yanik Culture in archaeological literature of Iran. The site dated back to Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age. ...|$|R

2500|$|As a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas {{directed}} major excavations [...] of Neolithic {{sites in}} southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near Štip, Republic of Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). <b>Digging</b> through layers <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> representing {{a period of}} time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe– where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds– she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and of religious cults, which she researched and documented throughout her career. During her successful career, Gimbutas stated, [...] "After a millennium when the Hun Empire collapsed, a distinct Slavic culture re-emerged and spread rapidly," [...] and [...] "Neither Bulgars nor Avars colonized the Balkan Peninsula, after storming Thrace, Illyria and Greece they went back to their territory north of the Danube. It was the Slavs who did the colonizing." ...|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 4 November 1998, {{the next}} {{installment}} focuses on dietary needs and how different species have evolved beaks {{to suit their}} individual requirements. The latter come in a multitude of forms. Blue tits and goldfinches have beaks akin to tweezers, with which to extract seeds, while the hawfinch's razor-like bill can deal with a cherry-stone. However, the crossbill is the only finch that can twist its mandibles in opposite directions. Jays store acorns for winter by burying them in the ground, whereas woodpeckers can keep up to 60,000 of them in one tree trunk. Sap is also desirable, {{and there are a}} variety of methods used to obtain it. The hoatzin is the only specialised leaf-eater, and accordingly has a digestive system more akin to that of cattle. Plants recruit birds to aid pollination, and offer nectar as a reward. hummingbirds eat little else, and the sword-bill's beak is the longest of any bird in relation to its body. Insects are also highly prized, and Galápagos finches are shown to possess some ingenuity as they not only strip bark, but also use 'tools' to reach their prey. Crows are hailed as being among the most intelligent birds, and one is shown using a twig to spear a grub within a fallen log. The robin is an opportunist, and Attenborough observes one seizing morsels as he <b>digs</b> a patch <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> In South America, a cattle tyrant sits atop an obliging capybara and uses its vantage point to spot passing food that may be dislodged by its grazing partner.|$|R
