And this approach also <b>helps</b> <b>students</b> better <b>understand</b> analyses that {{are not part of}} the GLM, such as predictive discriminant analysis (PDA). The approach <b>helps</b> <b>students</b> <b>understand</b> that all GLM analyses (a) are correlational, and thus are all susceptible to sampling error, (b) can yield r 2 -type effect sizes, and (c) use weights applied to measured variables to estimate the latent variables really of primary interest...|$|R

2500|$|Feminist historians see mainly two {{specific}} histories. The {{first is}} the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second {{is made up of}} women’s history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women’s History and Regular History that “ purpose is to <b>help</b> <b>students</b> <b>understand</b> the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture." [...] In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn’t learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women’s contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‘public’ and the ‘domestic’ sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.|$|E
