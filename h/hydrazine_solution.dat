30|$|The {{most widely}} used Si-based solar cell {{exhibits}} high conversion efficiency (up to 24.5 % at the University of New South Wales) [3]. However, it suffers from low throughput and high cost, therefore, could not affect the world’s energy market [4]. On the other hand, CIGS and CdTe offer high efficiencies (around 21 % and 21 %, respectively) for which they attracted the researchers {{for the last few}} years [5]. The main problem with these two materials is the toxicity of the constituent materials cadmium and selenium and also the less availability of tellurium and indium on earth [6]. To meet up the problems, an alternative material, CZTS has drawn the attraction with good advantages over CIGS and CdTe. During last few years, a good amount of researches had been done to improve the solar cell efficiency using CZTS absorber layer [7]. Wei Wang et al. presented a record cell efficiency of around 12.6 % using a <b>hydrazine</b> pure <b>solution</b> approach for Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 -based solar cell [8].|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{research}} work nickel hydroxide, cobalt hydroxide and Ni-doped cobalt hydroxide powders were synthesized through the precipitation method by using 0. 5 molar sodium hydroxide solution, 1 molar nickel chloride hexahydrate, cobalt chloride hexahydrate solution respectively along with <b>hydrazine</b> hydrate <b>solution.</b> Morphology of as-synthesised powders indicated spherical structure of nickel hydroxide and polyhedral structure of cobalt hydroxide. The surface morphology of the doped sample was similar to cobalt hydroxide because of higher amount of cobalt present in the doped sample. The DSC-TG curve shows that there is maximum percentage of mass loss at around 3000 C {{which is due to}} conversion of nickel hydroxide into nickel oxide and for cobalt hydroxide and the doped sample the weight loss happened around 1700 C. The photoluminescence test of the hydroxide and oxide samples are carried out. The result showed all the hydroxides have photoluminescence property in the violet-blue region. But among the calcined powders (300 °C), calcined nickel hydroxides and Ni-doped cobalt hydroxide showed the same violet-blue luminescence...|$|R
