50|$|The {{deflection}} {{signals are}} caused {{not only by}} sample topography, {{but also by the}} thermal expansion caused by Joule heating. Since AFM has feedback controller with a bandwidth, for example 20 kHz (different AFM may have different bandwidths), the signal below 20 kHz is captured and processed by the feedback controller which then adjusts the z-piezo to image surface topography. Joule <b>heating</b> <b>frequency</b> is kept well above 20 kHz to avoid feedback response and to separate topological and thermal effects. The upper limit of the frequency is limited by the decrease of thermoelastic expansion with the inverse power of the modulation frequency and the frequency characteristics of the cantilever arrangement. A lock-in amplifier is specially tuned to the Joule <b>heating</b> <b>frequency</b> for detecting only the expansion signal and provides the information to an auxiliary Atomic Force Microscopy channel to create the thermal expansion image. Usually expansion signals approximately 0.1 Angstroms start to be detected, although the resolution of SJEM highly depends on the whole system (cantilever, sample surface, etc.).|$|E

The combination of strong plasma confi nement and high microwave frequencies results in VENUS’ production of record breaking ion beam currents and high charge state distributions.

The bremsstrahlung deposited into the plasma chamber wall is absorbed by the cold mass used to maintain superconductivity in the magnets and poses an additional heat load on the cryostat.

Such experiments could reveal and help characterize temperature-driven phase transitions at high-pressure, such as melting, the glass transition, magnetic and electric orderings, or superconducting transitions. Specifically, we show that calorimetric information of a sample cannot be directly extracted from measurements at frequencies slower than the timescale of conduction to the diamond anvils (10 s to 100 s of kHz) since the experiment is far from adiabatic.
