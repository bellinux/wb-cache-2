40|$|It is {{the goal}} of this {{presentation}} to show that <b>equipment</b> <b>integration</b> not necessarily is a difficult and costly task. There are already available practical solutions and running applications in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries. The technical approach is derived from an initiative driven by the Semiconductor Industry Associaton SIA and its technical branch SEMATECH. There are also available international standards which can give equipment developers, integrators and users a valuable guide how to achieve inexpensive and high performing <b>equipment</b> <b>integration.</b> The <b>Equipment</b> <b>Integration</b> Framework is a set of prefabricated object oriented building blocks that software designers and programmers can use, extend or customize for specific computing solutions to control, monitor and collect data from the processing equipment in semiconductor manufacturing facilities, pharmaceutical industries and clinical laboratories. This object-oriented framework can be used for the rapid development of an arbitrary server software e. g. a virtual abstraction of a particular or a collection of process equipment, which generates information during processing. It provides client applications which interpret this information and send corresponding control commands, if necessary, to the processing equipment. These clients can be specialized to fulfill specific computing requirements in the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) or Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) context. The guiding architectural principles and guidelines that provide the technical foundation for the <b>equipment</b> <b>integration</b> framework to develop a customer specific <b>equipment</b> <b>integration</b> are shown.
