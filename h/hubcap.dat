50|$|Plastic has now largely {{replaced}} steel as {{the primary}} material for manufacturing <b>hubcaps</b> and trims, and where steel wheels are still used, the wheels are now generally painted black so the wheel is less visible through cutouts in the wheel trim. On modern automobiles, full-wheel <b>hubcaps</b> are most commonly seen on budget models and base trim levels, while upscale and performance-oriented models use alloy wheels. Modern aluminum alloy wheels generally use small removable center caps, similar in size to the earliest <b>hubcaps.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2006 (2007 US model year) the Prius added side-curtain {{air bags}} (standard on all models). A Touring Edition was introduced, with an {{elongated}} and larger rear spoiler {{as well as}} larger, sharper-pointed, seven-spoke, 16", magnesium wheels with plastic <b>hubcap</b> covers {{to protect them from}} scratches when parking against the curb. The Touring Edition also comes with a firmer, European-style, tuned suspension, standard high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, and integrated (non-HID) fog lights.|$|E
25|$|A spinner {{is a type}} of <b>hubcap</b> that spins {{independently}} {{inside of}} a wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop. As an attachment to the car's wheel, a spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest. The invention of the spinner is credited to James J.D. Gragg of Tulsa, Oklahoma who filed a patent on October 28, 1992 and was issued United States Patent 5,290,094 on March 4, 1994.|$|E
500|$|The second, #59-4975, was {{completed}} August 1959. On 29 September, {{the first attempt}} to hover was made with the Avrocar tethered to the ground. After the vehicle became airborne, an uncontrollable roll and pitch-coupled oscillation started that forced {{each of the three}} wheels into the ground in turn. The pilot, W. D. [...] "Spud" [...] Potocki, immediately shut down all engines. Changes were made to the stability system to provide more control authority, while new tethers were investigated to improve the ability to control these sorts of problems. As testing continued {{it became clear that the}} problem was inherent to the design, and the engineers started referring to the effect as [...] "hubcapping," [...] so-named as it appeared similar to a <b>hubcap</b> spun on the ground.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first and}} second prizes were usually {{desirable}} items such as a TV or games console, but the third prize was always a 'booby prize' like a <b>hubcap,</b> a cake made of carpet, a hairy cheese, bottled water from the River Hull or a chocolate tea pot. At the very end, the Bungalow Head with the least points was gunged, sitting on the toilet - though for the last series this practice was largely dropped, possibly because the contestants were already covered in [...] "creamy muck muck" [...] during the finale round.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph [...] "Rocky" [...] Rockford drove a GMC Sierra Classic {{pickup truck}} {{throughout}} the series. The truck had a 400-inch engine, Turbo 400 automatic transmission, and a 4-wheel drive factory setup. The custom exterior paint was silver with maroon panels and orange pinstriping. Additionally, the truck sported various after-market accessories added by noted California customizer and off-road racer, Vic Hickey, including the winch, brush guard, <b>hubcap</b> covers, sidestep bed plates, auxiliary gas tanks, custom steering wheel, rear roll bar, Cibié headlamps {{mounted on the}} front bumper/rear roll bar, and Pace CB radio.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "iconic" [...] {{flying saucer}} {{of the film}} has been {{variously}} identified as a paper plate or a <b>hubcap.</b> According to the documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion (1991) {{it was actually a}} recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: [...] "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top." [...] Inside the plastic dome was a little green man. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hubcaps</b> {{were first}} {{used on the}} Newton Reaction Carriage in 1680. The first <b>hubcaps</b> were more {{commonly}} known as dust or grease caps. These caps threaded onto the center hub on the wood, steel, or wire wheel. These were made {{from the beginning of}} car manufacturing to 1932. Pre-1915 <b>hubcaps</b> were all mostly made of brass that was nickel-plated. The 1920s <b>hubcaps</b> were mostly aluminum. Grease caps of the wire wheel brands such as Houk, Hayes, Frayer, Dayton, Buffalo, House, Phelps, Pasco, Rudge Whitworth, Budd, and Stewart are some of the hardest to find. When a customer went to buy the wire wheels, the make of the vehicle would be stamped in the center. During 1927 and 1928, the first snap-on center caps were being made on the wire wheels. After 1932, most every car had a snap-on style center cap on the middle of their wire, steel, or wood wheels. Wire wheel center caps in the 1930s had a spring-loaded retention clip system that has been used on many <b>hubcaps</b> and center caps on every style of car and truck to the present day.|$|R

2500|$|For much of {{his early}} life, James was a heavy drinker and smoker. He {{recorded}} in May Week Was in June his habit of filling a <b>hubcap</b> ashtray daily. At various times he wrote of attempts – intermittently successful – to give up drinking and smoking. He admitted smoking 80 cigarettes {{a day for a}} number of years. In April 2011, after media speculation that he had suffered kidney failure, James confirmed that he was suffering from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and had been in treatment for 15 months at Addenbrooke's Hospital. In an interview with BBC Radio 4 in June 2012, James admitted that the disease [...] "had beaten him" [...] and that he was [...] "near the end". He said that he was also diagnosed with emphysema and kidney failure in early 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{parts from}} three 1981 DeLoreans {{were used in}} the first film. Liquid {{nitrogen}} was poured onto the car for scenes after it had travelled through time {{to give the impression that}} it was cold. The base for the nuclear reactor was made from the <b>hubcap</b> from a Dodge Polara. Aircraft parts and blinking lights were added for effect. In one of the first scenes, carbon dioxide extinguishers were hidden inside the DeLorean to simulate the exhaust effect. Ultimately, five real DeLoreans {{were used in the}} filming of the trilogy, plus one [...] "process" [...] car built for interior shots. In the off-road scenes in the third film, a modified-for-off-road VW Beetle frame was fitted to the DeLorean with the whitewall tires and baby Moon hubcaps. A seventh DeLorean was also used in the filming; however, this one was merely a full-sized, fiberglass model used for exterior shots where the vehicle hovers above the set as well as when the actors interact with the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|On most Jo-Han models, {{especially}} on friction models, chassis detail was often absent - which lowered tooling expense {{for a company}} not quite so large as AMT or the later MPC. Commonly, the chassis base was just an indented slab with the Jo-Han company name and [...] "Detroit, Michigan", but sometimes the company name was completely absent and only the GM or other car logo was present - emphasizing the real manufacturer instead of Jo-Han, the model maker. Some later contracts, however, added complete chassis detail {{as seen in the}} 1970 Ford Maverick, and the Cadillac Coupe DeVille and Eldorado promotionals from the later 1970s. On the 1965 and 1966 full sized Chrysler promos, Jo-Han outdid themselves by offering working torsion bars, but these were dropped for 1967 [...] Apart from the often plain chassis, models were exact duplicates of the real thing in 1/25 scale. Wheels also carried accurate detail, including authentic and official logos and scripts in <b>hubcap</b> centers.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of cars can be found {{throughout}} the game. They are based on real life cars like Chevys, Fords, GMC and more. All the cars can be driven {{and there are also}} hidden cars around the cities that can be found. A unique feature about the cars is that <b>hubcaps</b> will fly off. The <b>hubcaps</b> fly off less than in the previous game, which makes the cars more realistic.|$|R
2500|$|The UK music press warmly {{received}} the album, Nick Kent in the NME confessing [...] "I'd be {{ashamed to say}} I didn't love it" [...] describing the music as one chord short of [...] "the strongest high energy cosmic <b>hubcap</b> {{this side of the}} Metal Zone". Andrew Means of Melody Maker commented that [...] "It's not melody and it's not harmony, and it's not really rhythm... it is ambiguity. It is the spaced out slipstream, the rushing, gurgling torrent of weightless sound that first turns the circle of mental pictures, associations and impressions picked out from space, time and earth... The listener is as much a traveller as the musician." [...] Sounds Martin Hayman meanwhile described the music as [...] "the bass and drums batter on with unflagging pace, synthesisers swirl and whistle around the thunderous block riffs whose endless repetition generates that numbed hypnosis, tuneless and menacing voices incant largely incomprehensible lyrics. This is not to knock Hawkwind: the sound they are getting is thicker, fuller, more convincing than ever before. [...] Its total effect is pretty devastating, but the means by which the effect is achieved is no revolution in sound." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{non-rotating}} <b>hubcap</b> {{retains the}} same orientation {{even when a}} vehicle is in motion. An example is the Rolls-Royce whose <b>hubcap</b> centers are weighted and mounted to revolve independently of the wheel rotation, thus the RR logo can be read while the vehicle is in motion.This design also allows for messages or advertising {{to be placed on}} the <b>hubcap</b> and be read while the vehicle is moving. Non-rotating hubcaps with advertisements may be found on race cars, taxis, commercial vehicles, industrial machinery, buses, and golf carts.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{the lore}} of <b>hubcaps</b> {{is that on}} bad roads they have a {{tendency}} of falling off due to hitting a bump. Center caps, however, fall off less frequently than older full wheel covers, which were often quite heavy. In some parts the U.S. and in Mexico there are of automotive garages whose walls were decorated with various <b>hubcaps</b> that had fallen off in the vicinity; they were often for sale.|$|R
