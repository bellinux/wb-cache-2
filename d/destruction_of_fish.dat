Proposals have been advanced by numerous disciplinary research teams to identify the environmental consequences of the project development. However, whether the project will benefit or damage the overall environment still remains in question. No matter which one of the four storage schemes is going to be put into operation, the human, economic, biological, and physical environmental alterations will have no equal in the our contemporary world and probably even for some time in the future. Above all, ﬂood control, hydro-electricity production and waterway improvement are the beneficial consequences, while population displacement, <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>ﬁsh</b> habitat, reservoir sedimentation, and coastal degradation are the adverse effects. Among all of these, ﬂood release, power generation, and inhabitant, resettlement are the most critical concerns of the project. Geographically, the project will be of advantage to the area downstream of the dam. Through application of an Environmental Evaluation System (EES), it is revealed that (1) the 150 -m Storage Scheme is the best one among the four alternatives, (2) each of the four is able to create more beneficial impacts than adverse ones on the environment, and (3) between 150 m and 180 m, the lower the normal water-level behind the dam the greater the benefit to the environment.

Many think of the oceans as the ultimate commons, and believe that fish stocks collapsed because individual fishermen did not restrain their behavior. However, the collapse of world fisheries was not caused by individual fishermen rushing to harvest but {{was the result of}} conscious policies adopted by the distant water fishing nations in general, and the U. S., in particular, to promote and expand global fisheries, not only for the fish, but for territorial reasons that were bound with foreign policy concerns during the Cold War. The distant water nations pushed for a policy of taking fish without restrictions, until critical biological points were estimated, then applying measures to slow or restrict the catch. The practical effect of this policy, known as Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) was that distant water nations fished unhindered until countries began expanding their territorial limits to 200 miles during the 1970 s. The policy greatly facilitated the rise of an industrial, global fishing system, creating fishing capacity that far exceeded the ability of stocks to reproduce. MSY was promoted as being grounded in conservation and sound science, but its adoption was greatly influenced by American foreign policy during this period. MSY also focused fisheries science on the narrow objective of determining harvest points, thus allowing the world’s distant water nations, including the U. S., to forestall attempts by smaller and poorer nations to enclose their fishing stocks to protect them from foreign exploitation...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation of pyrites {{in coastal}} Australian soils {{has been a}} concern for {{researchers}} in recent times. Acid pollution of creeks and rivers close to estuaries {{has been attributed to}} pyrite oxidation (Indraratna, 1997). The leaching of acid through the waterways to the estuarine system has led to a number of environmental problems such as <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> oysters, and other important marine life, including their habitats. Loss of infrastructure and lower levels of agricultural production have also been documented in the acid sulfate soils literature (Blunden and Indraratna, 1997; Blunden et al., 1997). A few remedial strategies, such as manipulation of the water table, have been considered by the University of Wollongong 2 ̆ 7 s acid sulfate soils group to deal with the problems in the South Coast of Illawarra (New South Wales, Australia). Artificially raising water tables tends to submerge the pyritic layer, thus preventing oxygen from reaching the layer and oxidizing the pyrites. Blunden (2000) monitored the effect of groundwater manipulation at Berry and developed a three-dimensional model to predict the amount of acid produced during droughts (see also Blunden and Indraratna, 1999). More recently, a novel tidal buffering strategy in floodgated drains has been implemented. The drainwater retains a high level of acidity that may be neutralized by the action of bicarbonates and carbonates transported upstream via the tidal Broughton creek (New South Wales). Otherwise, the leached acid flows into the waterways, severely degrading the creek water quality. However, before remediation strategies can be undertaken, an accurate estimate of the total acid production in the pyritic layer is usually required. A few models for this purpose exist in the literature that have been utilized in the past, but a novel cylindrical model is developed in this article...|$|E

The chapter concludes with a series of recommendations for activists to consider before deciding to participate in alternative dispute resolution or multistakeholder processes.

Ninety-four percent of the forest land base in the province is publicly owned Crown land. Since the mid- 1940 s, Crown land in British Columbia has been leased to forest companies that are allowed to cut at rates set by the provincial forester (see the discussion of tenure arrangements in the province in Chapter 2).

40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} put up {{a number}} of impacts from human activities in the sea; the most recent is fish farming, interacting synergistically with the other impacts and with the natural structure and dynamics of the coastal ecosystem. In the Mediterranean Sea, the number of fish farms has increased dramatically from early ‘ 80 s in coastal waters, releasing {{a substantial amount of}} organic matter, modifying the habitat and communities beneath cages and changing the spatio-temporal distribution of species. Among all the effects derived from fish farming, escape events of cultured fish are a relevant issue for management given their potential impact over wild counterparts in terms of habitat and food competition, genetic flow, biodiversity, spread diseases or parasites, and interaction with local fisheries, decreasing the price of the catches. This paper shows the first approach to model the temporal trends of biomass and yields of escapes from aquaculture by means of an EwE model. Three levels of escapes (× 1, ordinary level: 5000 ind year− 1 fish farm− 1, corresponding to 1. 31 t year− 1; massive event: ordinary level × 91; total <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> farm: ordinary level × 1800) and four levels of fishing effort (ordinary E, × 2, × 5, × 10) were modelled as mechanism to recapture escapees. Temporal variation of biomass and yield is used to define how long should be maintained the effort to catch escapees. The total destruction of a fish farm generates the higher increase of escapees' landings, dissapearing in less than 6 months if fishing effort reach 10 -fold the ordinary fishing effort. Differences among revenues from recaptures and derived expenses were always negative but tending to be greater for low levels of fishing effort and/or levels of escapes which means no fishery can be expected to be maintained by escapes. In general, fleets benefit from escapees in terms of yield but gains will depend on how escapees affect either positively or negatively the value of the catch. Simulations using EwE models may result a useful tool to design suitable recapture plans of escapees.

For Bayelsa fisheries {{to play a major}} role in attainingthe MDG’s, this paper is therefore recommending that Community - Based Resource Management should beadopted in the management of fisheries in the state; Liberal credit facilities should be provided and existingfinancial services publicized; well – funded and equipped Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit shouldbe established; skippers to man fishing vessels should be trained; fishers should also be trained in proper andhygienic fish handling techniques; an agricultural procurement agency should be established; and a statefisheries/plan policy should be put in place urgently...|$|R

A detachment from the garrison at St. John's, Newfoundland volunteered to serve on a captured twenty-gun ship for an expedition with three privateers to Fishotte Bay. The prize entered Fishotte Bay alone and engaged a number of anchored French ships. After five hours of fighting {{and the loss of}} ten killed and thirty wounded, the ship had captured three fourteen-gun and two twelve-gun enemy ships; forty six of their crews were killed and three hundred and thirty two made prisoner. The lagging privateers entered the harbour and assisted in the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> French <b>fishing</b> stages and the removal of enemy ships and prisoners.|$|R
