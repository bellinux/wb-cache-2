5|$|The play's <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> {{sometimes}} enlisted famous participants; the Broadway selections were rigged {{to call on}} celebrities {{known to}} be in the audience. The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney EdwardJ. Reilly—who was known from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial earlier that year—and boxing champion Jack Dempsey. At a special performance for the blind, Helen Keller sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, {{it is virtually impossible to}} know whether a <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Juries</b> <b>have</b> granted acquittals in 15-20% of cases, {{compared}} {{with less than}} 1% in cases decided by judges. Juries may be dismissed and skeptical <b>juries</b> <b>have</b> been dismissed {{on the verge of}} verdicts, and acquittals are frequently overturned by higher courts.|$|R

25|$|Every death {{sentence}} involves first an eligibility determination {{and then a}} selection of an eligible defendant {{for the death penalty}}. A defendant is eligible for the death penalty once the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> concluded that {{he is a member of}} that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible defendant is then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is worthy of a {{death sentence}}.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 2009, Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo was {{announced}} as the inaugural {{recipient of the}} prize, which carried with it a cash award of $1,000,000. The first award ceremony {{took place in the}} Royal Swedish Opera on 13 October 2009. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden personally presented the prize to the designated winner. A <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> been set up by the foundation to make recommendations for future prizes. The second winner of the Birgit Nilsson prize was Riccardo Muti, who received the award in Stockholm on 13 October 2011. On 9 April 2014 it {{was announced}} that the third recipient of the prize would be the Vienna Philharmonic.|$|E
25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple criticises the {{introduction}} by Harriet Harman of the Family Impact Statement. Dalrymple writes that such statements [...] "are {{not permitted to}} influence {{the outcome of a}} case. They are made only after a <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> made its verdict". As a result, kitsch displays of emotion are encouraged in court, of no practical benefit.|$|E
500|$|Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>has</b> been {{recorded}} many times. [...] Of the recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, those recorded in 1927 and 1964 are ranked the best, {{according to the}} [...] "Gilbert and Sullivan Discography", edited by Marc Shepherd. [...] The 1961 Sargent and especially the 1995 Mackerras recordings are also rated highly by the Discography. [...] The reviewer Michael Walters gives his highest praise to the 1924 recording, but he also likes the 1961 recording.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E

500|$|That Robert Dudley {{might have}} {{influenced}} the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> been argued by George Bernard, Susan Doran, and by Chris Skidmore. The foreman, Sir Richard Smith (mayor of Abingdon in 1564/1565), had been a household servant of Princess Elizabeth and {{is described as a}} former [...] "Queen's man" [...] and a [...] "lewd" [...] person in Hales' 1563 chronicle, while Dudley gave a [...] "Mr. Smith", also a [...] "Queen's man", a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566; six years after the inquest. It has, however, not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the [...] "Mr. Smith" [...] of 1566 {{are one and the same}} person, Smith being a [...] "very common" [...] name. Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder.|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1671, Hale {{was made}} Chief Justice of the King's Bench {{after the death}} of John Kelynge. Edward Turnour {{replaced}} him as Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge, but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative. Roger North wrote that [...] "I have known the Court of King's Bench sitting every day from eight to 12, and the Lord Chief Justice Hale's managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to the students, and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose, and used to debate with counsel, so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice". He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that [...] "If the judge or <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> a right understanding it signifies nothing but {{a waste of time and}} loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and biassing their affections." [...] As a judge, however, he was noted by Lord Nottingham as the greatest orator on the bench.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a similar}} power exists, often called [...] "jury equity". This enables {{a jury to}} reach a {{decision}} in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge [...] thus a <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> the power to influence the law.|$|E
2500|$|This power, {{which is}} {{analogous}} to the bringing of criminal charges by a grand <b>jury,</b> <b>has</b> been used only rarely. [...] The House of Representatives has initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789, and nineteen federal officials have been formally impeached as a result, including: two Presidents (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton), one Cabinet Secretary (William W. Belknap), one Senator (William Blount), one Supreme Court Associate Justice (Samuel Chase), and fourteen federal judges.|$|E

He and co-songwriter Pharrell Williams must pay Gaye's family $7.3 million {{as part of the}} ruling, {{according}} to Variety. The verdict puts to rest over a year's worth of legal back and forth between Thicke and Gaye's estate, in which the latter sought $25 million in damages." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{law of the}} Republic of Ireland is {{historically}} based on English common law and had a similar jury system. [...] Article 38 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland mandates trial by jury for criminal offences, with exceptions for minor offences, military tribunals, and where [...] "the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order". DPP v McNally sets out that a <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Felony {{defendants}} must {{be released}} on [...] day if they haven't been indicted, {{which is to say}} that unless a grand <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> indicted the defendant and a hearing has commenced within 120 hours/5 days (with an additional 24 hours allowed for weekends and holidays, i.e., 144 hours/6 days), or proof that the indictment was voted within 120 hours, and unless the delay was due to a request of the defendant, and absent a compelling reason for the prosecution's delay, the defendant must {{be released on}} their own recognizance (ROR'd).|$|E
2500|$|Five of the jurors, who convicted Workman in 1982, {{have since}} signed {{affidavits}} renouncing either the sentence or the verdict or both.
