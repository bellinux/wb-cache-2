5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran <b>his</b> <b>model</b> on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify <b>his</b> <b>model</b> to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games and on <b>his</b> <b>model</b> of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented {{the theory of}} duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with <b>his</b> <b>model,</b> Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
50|$|Kingelez {{is known}} for <b>his</b> <b>models</b> mostly of fantastic and utopian cities made of cardboard, paper and plastic. <b>His</b> <b>models</b> of entire cities reflect the {{sprawling}} and anarchic metropolis of Kinshasa or other African megacities, offering a futurist vision of the African city. <b>His</b> <b>models</b> frequently incorporate materials found in the urban world, such as bottle caps, corrugated cardboard or tinfoil. This mirrors the widespread practice of recycling found in Kinshasa or other African cities.|$|R

5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into <b>his</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has {{proposed}} a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference particularly to the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there.

5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as <b>his</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1844, Albert {{had managed}} to modernise the royal {{finances}} and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family. Over {{the next few years}} a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and Thomas Cubitt. Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; <b>his</b> <b>model</b> farm at Windsor was admired by his biographers, and under his stewardship the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.|$|E
5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued <b>his</b> <b>model</b> rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. <b>His</b> <b>model</b> successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E

5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied <b>his</b> <b>model</b> from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{remained}} at Cornell until 1964, {{when he went}} to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He remained there for the remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering, an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration of the cosmos through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars. He returned to this in 1976, applying <b>his</b> <b>model</b> to the radio galaxy Cygnus A.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 1590, the German {{astronomer}} Michael Maestlin observed an occultation of Mars by Venus. One of his students, Johannes Kepler, {{quickly became}} an {{adherent to the}} Copernican system. After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, Tycho Brahe. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse and the Sun was located {{at one of the}} foci. <b>His</b> <b>model</b> became the basis for Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which were published in his multi-volume work Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.|$|E

5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as <b>his</b> <b>model.</b> He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E
5|$|Pierre-Simon Laplace {{independently}} {{developed and}} proposed a similar model in 1796 in his Exposition du systeme du monde. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout {{the volume of}} the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. <b>His</b> <b>model</b> was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|That year, Chisholm {{revived the}} South African College of Music where he {{eventually}} would teach composer Stefans Grové and singer Désirée Talbot. Using Edinburgh University as <b>his</b> <b>model,</b> Chisholm appointed new staff, extended {{the number of}} courses, and introduced new degrees and diplomas.

With {{the assistance of the}} Italian baritone Gregorio Fiasconaro, Chisholm also established the college's opera company in 1951 and opera school in 1954. In addition, Chisholm founded the South African section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in 1948, assisted in the founding of the Maynardville Open-Air Theatre on 1 December 1950, and pursued an international conducting career.|$|E

5|$|Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century {{commentary}} in the Zhoubi suanjing describes two astronomical theories: in one, {{the heavens}} are shaped as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, {{while the other}} compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where the heavens are shaped as a celestial sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in <b>his</b> <b>Model</b> Sayings (Fayan 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) of 120 CE.
