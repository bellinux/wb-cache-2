5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|Elemental Spirits, {{also called}} Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{retains the}} basic {{gameplay}} from previous {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, where the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of lead, bass, and rhythm guitar parts in rock songs by playing in time to scrolling notes on-screen. The game, in addition to existing single-player Career modes, includes a new Co-Op Career mode and competitive challenges that pit the player against in-game characters and other players. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first game in the series to include an online multiplayer feature, which <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> in the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions. Initially the game offers over 70 songs, {{most of which are}} master tracks. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature the ability to download additional songs. The musicians Tom Morello (of the bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave) and Slash (of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver) make appearances both as guitar battle opponents and playable characters in the game. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions also include Bret Michaels (of Poison) as a non-playable character.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature <b>is</b> <b>enabled,</b> additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E
5|$|There is a Practice mode {{which allows}} the player to {{practice}} any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no selectable difficulty level, or set amount of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for those {{out of the race}} early will appear if the option <b>is</b> <b>enabled.</b> Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.|$|E

5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard <b>is</b> <b>enabled,</b> the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E
5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

Song voting can only be done when song requesting <b>is</b> <b>enabled</b> and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section.
