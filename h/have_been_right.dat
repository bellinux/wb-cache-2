25|$|Both {{the date}} and the {{circumstances}} of Raymond's release are uncertain. According to William of Tyre, Raymond was set free after spending eight (solar) years in captivity, but Ibn Jubayr stated that Raymond had been held in prison for twelve (lunar) years. Ali ibn al-Athir recorded that Raymond was released after Nur ad-Din died on 15 May 1174, but he was obviously wrong, because Raymond had witnessed a royal charter in Jerusalem already on 18 April 1174. On the other hand, according to Lewis, Ali ibn al-Athir may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> when claiming that Raymond was released because of the emerging conflict between Nur ad-Din's family and his ambitious commander, Saladin.|$|E

500|$|Of the 30 players {{selected}} {{in the first round}} by the Rockies, 18 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 12 of these <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> handed, and 6 have been left-handed. [...] The Rockies have also selected five outfielders, four shortstops, and one player each at catcher, first base, and third base. [...] The Rockies have never selected a second baseman in the first round. The Rockies have drafted 16 players out of high school, and 14 out of college. Colorado has drafted seven players from high schools or colleges in the state of California, with five coming from Texas and three from Tennessee. The Rockies' 2002 selection—Jeff Francis—is the only selection from outside the United States.|$|E
500|$|Jazz author Ted Gioia, who {{reviewed}} the album for The Daily Beast, {{was surprised by}} Gaga's ability to sing jazz, saying that [...] "in all fairness to Lady Gaga, any singer who matches up with Tony Bennett needs to get loud and assertive... Her voice projects an appealing innocence [...] 'But Beautiful' and 'Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye'". Rating it {{four out of five}} stars, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy complimented the vocal mix on the album, adding that [...] "Cheek to Cheek may not be the glittering spectacle we've come to expect from Lady Gaga, but with Tony Bennett's guidance the pair have delivered an authentic and solid jazz record that respects the genre's generous history. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars and praised Gaga's vocals. Dolan felt the album [...] "proves she can be a sophisticated lady". Charles J. Gan from Associated Press also praised Bennett and Gaga's singing, writing that [...] "Had she been born in an earlier era, Gaga would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> at home in an MGM musical". Idolator's Bianca Gracie described the album as [...] "a refreshing listen that highlights the undeniable talent of both Bennett and Gaga and how well they work together". Writing for the National Post, Mike Doherty observed that Gaga took [...] "liberties with the beat, bends notes, purrs and whoops away" [...] with the vocals, while Bennett was able to complement with his characteristic [...] "dapper approach".|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, David Astor and his {{newspaper}} {{came under fire}} when it accused Prime Minister Anthony Eden of lying to the people about important matters in Suez Crisis.

Astor's causes included playing a main role in establishing Amnesty International in 1961 after his paper published [...] "The Forgotten Prisoners" [...] by Peter Benenson. He also voiced strong opposition to the apartheid policy of the white South African government and supported the African National Congress (ANC).

2500|$|In {{her early}} days as speaker, Sauvé often made {{mistakes}} {{with the names}} of MPs or the ridings they represented—once calling on the Prime Minister as the [...] "leader of the opposition"—and occasionally miscarried procedural rulings, which led to MPs addressing her with increasing curtness. Further, all 32 of the New Democratic Party MPs in the house walked out in protest of what they viewed as a bias on Sauvé's part; they felt she allowed Liberal MPs to ask more questions than those from any other party. In a CBC interview, Sauvé conceded that the NDP members may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> that the Liberals may have been allowed more questions over two or three days, but, on the whole, each party received an equal number of opportunities. It was also speculated that MPs had taken to showboating for the television cameras that had recently been installed in the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Grote uses Droysen's {{terminology}} but {{gives him}} no credit for it. Instead he attacks Droysen's concept of Alexander planting Hellenism in eastern colonies: [...] "Plutarch states that Alexander founded more than seventy new cities in Asia. So large {{a number of}} them is neither verifiable nor probable, unless we either reckon up simple military posts or borrow from the list of foundations really established by his successors." [...] He avoids Droysen's term in favor of the traditional [...] "successor". In a long note he attacks Droysen's thesis as [...] "altogether slender and unsatisfactory." [...] Grote may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right,</b> but he ignores entirely Droysen's main thesis, that the concepts of [...] "successors" [...] and [...] "sons of successors" [...] were innovated and perpetuated by historians writing contemporaneously or nearly so with the period. Not enough evidence survives to prove it conclusively, but enough survives to win acceptance for Droysen as the founding father of Hellenistic history.|$|E
2500|$|Hayek's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} economics is widely acknowledged. Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics, which is particularly striking since his own lecture was critical of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award but nevertheless claimed that [...] "there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last {{half of the twentieth century}} economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> and his own teacher, Joseph Schumpeter, to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.|$|E

Clark's Extra Pop Emporium. Also in 2012, Ice Cube had released more details on his upcoming tenth studio album titled, Everythang's Corrupt. A music video for the album's first single {{of the same name}} was released on the day before the 2012 USA Election. Ice Cube explained the inspiration and reason for the song saying, [...] "You know, this record is for the political heads. This to me is more a leak at the right time, in time, to drop it. We could have dropped a more catchier tune, but the time wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right.</b> The time is right for [...] "Everythang's Corrupt," [...] so that's what we wanted to do.

The second single [...] "Crowded" [...] was released to iTunes on March 29. Ice Cube confirmed on his Twitter account that the album will be released in the fall of 2013 and will also be released via Lench Mob Records. However, the album would be pushed back once again with no release date currently set.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 1941, when Operation Barbarossa started Meretskov was {{appointed}} permanent adviser to Stavka. However, on July 23 {{he was arrested}} by the NKVD {{as a member of}} an alleged anti-Soviet military conspiracy. The exact reasons are unknown, and the case file was destroyed in 1955. Meretskov's close friendship with General Dmitry Pavlov, the Soviet Commander of the Western Front who had been executed, is often considered a factor, although Pavlov, at the time, was yet to even be relieved of duty, much less arrested. Mark Solonin, in his book June the 25th: Stupidity or Aggression, proposes a theory that the actual reason might have been Meretskov's skepticism about the need to start bombardments of Finland, and his later release was due to him turning out to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right,</b> although he admits that direct evidence is unlikely to be found. After being subjected to two months of torture, including being beaten with rubber rods, in Lubyanka Prison, Meretskov relented and signed a written confession. [...] According to Nikita Khrushchev, [...] "before his arrest, Meretskov had been a strapping young general, very strong and impressive-looking. After his release, he was a shadow of his former self. He had lost so much weight he could hardly speak." [...] Released in September, he was taken before the police chief, Vsevolod Merkulov, whom he had known socially: he told Merkulov that their friendship was over. He was then presented to Stalin, in full army dress, and given command of the [...] 7th Separate Army. His confession was used against other commanders arrested in May–July 1941, who were executed on the order of Lavrenty Beria near Kuybyshev on October 28, 1941, or sentenced by the Special Council of the NKVD and executed on February 23, 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Cary wrote [...] "there was {{not doubt}} of the {{legality}} of the catch", Jack Fingleton called it [...] "one of the most unfortunate decisions {{in the history of the}} Tests." [...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>right</b> and I may have been wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote [...] "that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous".|$|E
