Within the general framework of safety assessment of nanomaterials during their lifecycle, the main objective of the PLATOX project (funded by EU FP 7 -SIINN ERA-NET Programme) is to apply a tiered approach to assess the toxicity of GFNs and finally identify the <b>derived</b> <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> (DNEL) parameter for inhalation exposure. A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of six commercially available GFNs (single- and multilayer graphene/graphene oxide, carboxyl graphene, and graphite oxide) was followed by an in vitro toxicity screening using different endpoints and lung-relevant cell models (primary rat alveolar macrophages, murine macrophages and primary human lung fibroblasts). In vitro testing comprised evaluation of the cytotoxic (membrane damage, metabolic activity and cell proliferation), genotoxic (oxidative comet assay and cell cycle dynamics) and pro-inflammatory potentials (cytokine/eicosanoid release). Cytotoxicity results were {{used to calculate the}} benchmark dose (BMD 30), a parameter subsequently used as starting concentration for the other endpoints. Generally, the in vitro results showed a higher sensitivity of the macrophage models, compared to fibroblasts, and a higher toxicity of single layer graphenes, as compared to the other GFNs. The high toxicity was correlated with a higher surface area of the single layer graphenes. These results allowed us to establish a toxicity ranking and to select two GFNs with low and high toxicity to be tested in a 28 -day inhalation toxicity study in rats. All results will be further integrated in the overall risk assessment workflow...|$|E

The attitude of key stakeholders in industry, trade unions, branch and employers’ organizations, and government policy advisors toward nano reference values (NRVs) has been investigated in a pilot study that was initiated by a coalition of Dutch employers’ organizations and Dutch trade unions.

The motivational posture of most companies involved in the pilot study appears to be pro-active regarding worker protection and acquiescent to NRVs.

It reflects the discussions of 80 international participants representing small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), large companies, trade unions, governmental authorities, research institutions, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from many European countries, USA, India, and Brazil. Issues that were discussed concerned the usefulness and acceptability of precaution-based NRVs as a substitute for health-based occupational exposure limits (OELs) and <b>derived</b> <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> (DNELs) for manufactured nanoparticles (NPs). Topics concerned the metrics for measuring NPs, the combined exposure to manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) and process-generated NPs, the use of the precautionary principle, the lack of information about the presence of nanomaterials, and the appropriateness of soft regulation for exposure control. The workshop concluded that the NRV, as an 8 -h time-weighted average, is a comprehensible and useful instrument for risk management of professional use of MNMs with a dispersible character.

Meanwhile, the setting of occupational exposure limits (OELs) continues both at the member state and the EU levels. According to REACH, indicative OEL values (IOELVs) from the Commission may under some circumstances be used as worker-DNELs. On the other hand, worker-DNELs will be derived for several thousand substances, {{far more than the}} approximately 100 substances for which IOELVs have been established. Thus, the procedure to set health-based OELs may become influential on that of DNELs and vice versa. In this study, we compare the safety margins of 88 Scientific Committee on OELs (SCOEL) recommendations with those of the corresponding worker-DNELs, derived according to the default approach as described in the REACH guidance document.

Within the ENRHES project a comprehensive and critical scientific review of publicly available health and safety information on four types of nanoparticles was performed. Based on the identified exposure and hazard data, basic human health risk assessment appraisals were carried out for fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nano-silver and nano-titanium dioxide. These risk assessment appraisals followed the structure of a regulatory risk assessment and if possible and relevant, it was attempted to <b>derive</b> indicative human <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> from key studies by applying assessment factors as suggested in the technical guidance document for REACH.

We compared long-term inhalation worker-DNELs (wDNELs) presented by industry with the corresponding Swedish occupational exposure limits (OELs), {{and for a}} subset, with wDNELs derived by us. Our wDNELs were derived using toxicological evaluations published by the Swedish Criteria Group and our interpretation of the REACH Guidance. On average, industry's wDNELs {{were the same as}} the Swedish OELs (median of wDNEL-OEL ratios: 0. 98, n = 235). However, the variation was huge, the extremes being up to 450 times higher, and up to 230 times lower than the corresponding OEL. Nearly one-fifth of the wDNELs were = 2 times higher and one-third = 2 times lower than the OEL. No time trend was seen in the wDNEL/OEL ratios, suggesting that older OELs were not systematically higher than the more recent ones. Industry's wDNELs varied widely and were generally higher (median 4. 2 times, up to 435 times higher, down to 13 times lower, n = 23) also compared to our wDNELs. Only five industry wDNELs were equal to or lower than ours. The choices of key studies, dose descriptors, and assessment factors all seemed to contribute to the discrepancies. We conclude that although the REACH guidance is detailed, many choices that will influence the wDNEL lack firm instructions. A major problem is that little advice is given on when and how to depart from default assessment factors. QC 20150626 </p...|$|R
40|$|Nano {{reference}} values (NRVs) for occupational use of nanomaterials were tested as provisional substitute for Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs). NRVs {{can be used}} as provisional limit values until Health-Based OELs or <b>derived</b> <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> (DNEL) become available. NRVs were defined for 8 h periods (time weighted average) and for short-term exposure periods (15 min-time weighted average). To assess the usefulness of these NRVs, airborne number concentrations of nanoparticles (NPs) in the workplace environment were measured during paint manufacturing, electroplating, light equipment manufacturing, non-reflective glass production, production of pigment concentrates and car refinishing. Activities monitored were handling of solid engineered NPs (ENP), abrasion, spraying and heating during occupational use of nanomaterials (containing ENPs) and machining nanosurfaces. The measured concentrations are often presumed to contain ENPs as well as process-generated NPs (PGNP). The PGNP are found to be a significant source for potential exposure and cannot be ignored in risk assessment. Levels of NPs identified in workplace air were up to several millions of nanoparticles/cm 3. Conventional components in paint manufacturing like CaCO 3 and talc may contain a substantial amount of nanosized particulates giving rise to airborne nanoparticle concentrations. It is argued that risk assessments carried out for e. g. paint manufacturing processes using conventional non-nano components should take into account potential nanoparticle emissions as well. The concentrations measured were compared with particle-based NRVs and with mass-based values that have also been proposed for workers protection. It is concluded that NRVs can be used for risk management for handling or processing of nanomaterials at workplaces provided that the scope of NRVs is not limited to ENPs only, but extended to the exposure to process-generated NPs as well...|$|R

There are different approaches to risk assessment and determination of occupational exposure limits. The {{purpose of this article is}} to compare exposure levels in the work environment proposed by international organizations and world experts, as well as the assumptions and methods used for their estimation. This paper presents the proposals of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan (NEDO) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the USA (NIOSH). The authors also discuss the reports on the levels for carbon nanotubes (Baytubes® and Nanocyl) proposed by Pauluhn and Luizi, the <b>derived</b> <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> (DNEL) complying with the REACH Regulation, proposed by experts under the 7 th Framework Programme of the European Commission, coordinated by Professor Vicki Stone (ENRHES), and alternative estimation levels for poorly soluble particles by Pauluhn. The issue was also raised whether the method of determining maximum admissible concentrations in the work environment, currently used in Poland, is adequate for nanoobjects. Moreover, the introduction of nanoreference values, as proposed by RIVM, the definition of a new fraction for particles of 1 - 100 nm, taking into account the surface area and activity of the particles, and an adequate estimation of uncertainty factors seem to be worth considering. Other important, if not key issues are the appropriate measurement (numerical concentration, surface concentration, particle size distribution), as well as the methodology and equipment accessibility to all employers responsible for a reliable risk assessment of exposure to nanoparticles in the work environment.

40|$|Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) {{are used}} as an {{important}} regulatory instrument to protect workers’ health from adverse effects of chemical exposures. The main objective of this thesis is to study risk assessment practices {{in the setting of}} OEL in order to produce knowledge that will help improve the consistency and transparency of OELs. For the purpose of paper I a database of OELs for a total of 1341 substances was compiled. Of these, only 25 substances have OELs from all 18 included organisations while more than one third of the substances are only regulated by one organisation alone. The average level of OELs differs substantially between organisations; the US OSHA exposure limits are (on average) nearly 40 % higher than those of Poland. In paper II six EU member states’ OELs are compared to the European Commission’s OELs. Also within Europe there is a large difference concerning the average level of OELs (35 %). The average level of lists tends to decrease over time, although there are exceptions to this. There are also indications that the exposure limits of EU member states are converging towards the European Commission’s OELs. The work presented in paper III identifies steps in the risk assessment that could account for the large differences in OELs for 14 different substances. Differences in the identification of the critical effect could explain the different level of the OELs for half of the substances. But the age of the data review could not account for all the differences in data selection, only one fifth of the documents referred to all available key studies. Also the evaluation of the key studies varied significantly. The aim of paper IV was to investigate how the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) of the European Commission uses assessment factors when proposing health-based indicative OELs. For only one third of the investigated OELs were explicit assessment factors given. On average the safety margin of the recommendations was 2. 1 higher when an explicit assessment factor had been used. It is recommended that the SCOEL develop and adhere to a more articulate framework on the use of assessment factors. Paper V focuses on the <b>Derived</b> <b>No-Effect</b> <b>Levels</b> (DNELs) which are to be calculated under the new European Union REACH legislation. It is a comparison of the safety margins of 88 SCOEL recommendations with those of the corresponding worker-DNELs, derived according to the default approach as described in the REACH guidance document.

40|$|A {{literature}} study {{was performed to}} evaluate dose-response relationships and <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> for sensitization and elicitation in skin- and respiratory allergy. With respect to the skin, dose-response relationships and <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> were found for both intradermal and topical induction, {{as well as for}} intradermal and topical elicitation of allergenic responses in epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies. Skin damage or irritation may result in a significant reduction of the <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> for a specific compound. With respect to the respiratory tract, dose-response relationships and <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> for induction were found in several human as well as animal studies. Although dose-response relationships for elicitation were found in some epidemiological studies, concentration-response relationships were present only in a limited number of animal studies. Reported results suggest that especially relatively high peak concentrations can induce sensitization, and that prevention of such concentrations will prevent workers from developing respiratory allergy. Moreover, induction of skin sensitization may result in subsequent heightened respiratory responsiveness following inhalation exposure. The threshold concentration for the elicitation of allergic airway reactions in sensitized subjects is generally lower than the threshold to induce sensitization. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} the low threshold levels for elicitation for recommendation of health-based occupational exposure limits, and to avoid high peak concentrations. Notwithstanding the observation of dose-response relationships and <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels,</b> due to a number of uncertainties, no definite conclusions can be drawn about absolute threshold values for allergens with respect to sensitization of and elicitation reactions in the skin and respiratory tract. Most predictive tests are generally meant to detect the potential of a chemical to induce skin and/or respiratory allergy at relatively high doses. Consequently, these tests do not provide information of dose-response relationships at lower doses such as found in, for example, occupational situations. In addition, the observed dose-response relationships and threshold values have been obtained by a wide variety of test methods using different techniques, such as intradermal exposure versus topical or inhalation exposure at the workplace, or using different endpoints, which all appear important for the outcome of the test. Therefore, especially with regard to respiratory allergy, standardized and validated dose-response test methods are urgently required in order to be able to recommend safe exposure levels for allergens at the workplace.

The model predicts that exposure of volunteers to cyclohexane at levels of 4100 mg/m 3 (̃ 1200 ppm) will result in brain levels {{similar to those in}} rats exposed to 8000 mg/m 3 (the <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> for acute central nervous system effects). There are no acute central nervous system effects in humans exposed to 860 mg/m 3, consistent with model predictions that current occupational exposure levels for cyclohexane protect against acute central nervous system effects. © The Author(s) 2009...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the second {{version of the}} PC-program 'European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances', EUSES 2. 0. It completely replaces the EUSES 1. 0 program and documentation. EUSES 2. 0 {{is designed to be}} a decision-support system for the evaluation of the risks of substances to man and the environment. The system is fully based on the EU Technical Guidance Documents for the risk assessment of new and existing substances and biocides. The documentation and program can be obtained from the European Chemicals Bureau, Ispra, Italy. EUSES {{is the result of a}} co-ordinated effort of EU Member States, the European Commission and the Europe-an Chemical Industry. This risk assessment is transparent and easy to perform: EUSES is well documented and available as a user-friendly computer program. Risks to man pertain to consumers, workers and man exposed through the environment. Protection goals in the environment include sewage treatment plant populations of micro-organisms, aquatic, terrestrial and sediment ecosystems and populations of predators. This assessment includes the marine environment. The risk assessment is carried out in a stepwise procedure starting with data input and estimation and further involving the estimation of emissions, the prediction of environmental distribution, the calculation of human and environmental exposure, the derivation of <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> and the risk characterisation. Virtually all default settings can be changed and all estimated parameter values and intermediate results can be overwritten by measured data. The exposure assessment in EUSES covers the whole life cycle of substances as well as their fate in all environmental compartments at three spatial scales: the personal scale for consumers and workers, the local scale for man and ecosystems near point sources and the regional scale for man and ecosystems exposed as a result of all releases in a larger region. Where appropriate, in the effects module <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> are <b>derived</b> for all ecosystems and populations considered. The human effects assessment covers all relevant endpoints for both threshold and non-threshold substances. The end-point of EUSES is a quantitative comparison per substance of the results of the effects and the exposure assessment. The resulting risk characterisation ratios (RCRs) can be regarded as indicators for the likelihood of adverse effects occurring...|$|R
40|$|Health risk {{analysis}} needs to apply newer {{developments in the}} understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the carcinogenic process which has allowed for the classification of chemical carcinogens into those that damage genetic material directly (genotoxic carcinogens) and those that operate by indirect or epigenetic mechanisms. We propose a systematic decision point approach for detecting and evaluating substances for carcinogenic risk. This approach recognizes that genotoxic and epigenetic agents operate by different mechanisms and distinguishes between these two categories of carcinogens primarily on the basis of results in a battery of short-term tests that includes systems which reliably detect genotoxic carcinogens and others which may respond to epigenetic agents. Genotoxic carcinogens at very low dosages may have practical, effective threshold <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels,</b> but, nevertheless, because of their mechanism of action they are regarded as a qualitative hazard. The action of epigenetic agents of the promoter class is highly dose-dependent and reversible, and thus, a distinctively different health {{risk analysis}} is required for these agents to take account of their quantitatively lesser hazard...|$|R
40|$|The project "Comparative Assessment and Management of Radiological and Non-Radiological Risks Associated with Energy Systems" aims {{to develop}} a method for the {{comparison}} of environmental and human health impacts of electricity generating systems. Two energy systems serve as cases: the coal fuel cycle in Germany and the nuclear fuel cycle in France; they are compared {{on the basis of}} a Multi Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA). This report presents a set of indicators to describe the environmental impacts. The indicators are described in more detail for a limited number of environmental concerns, i. e. climate change, depletion of natural resources, acidification and eutrophication, contamination with radionuclides and with heavy metals; they are illustrated with sample calculations. The examples show that it is possible to define environmental indicators based on <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> which can be easily calculated and intercompared. However, problems arise in the comparison of the pressure indicators, on the one hand, and chemical-state indicators on the other. This comparison should be executed in the MAUA, where the different indicators are weighted...|$|R
40|$|Species {{sensitivity}} distributions (SSDs) {{are used}} in ecological risk assessment to derive maximum acceptable concentrations of toxicants in the environment from a limited set of ecotoxicity data obtained in the laboratory. Such distributions usually employ continuous bell-shaped functions such as the normal and the logistic distribution, which have the disadvantage that an arbitrary cut-off value must be chosen (usually the 5 -percentile) to designate the concentration below which the fraction of species exposed above their <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> is considered acceptably small. In this paper the possibility is explored of introducing a true no-effect principle in the SSD framework by considering models with a finite lower threshold. Four of these distributions are elaborated, the uniform, triangular, exponential and Weibull distributions. The mathematical representations of these functions were re-parameterized allowing direct estimation of the threshold parameter by nonlinear regression. By way of example, a data set comprising chronic ecotoxicity of zinc to 21 different aquatic organisms was used. The exponential distribution did not describe the data well. The other distributions provided estimates for H...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree clones of E. coli, one {{of which}} was {{harbouring}} a tetracycline resistance plasmid were inoculated together into the stomach of axenic mice. Without antibiotic selective pressure, the R-Plasmid bearing strain became dominant in the faeces of mice, while the R-plasmid free strain was eliminated. When the R-plasmid bearing strain was given to mice 4 days after the inoculation with the R-plasmid free strain, it was repressed and remained at the stable level of 10 (4. 5) organisms per g of faeces. But a rapid spread of the R-plasmid was observed, tetracycline resistant bacteria become dominant within one day, and replace the tetracycline sensitive E. coli. The tetracycline resistance plasmid did not disadvantage the mediating strain in the gut, {{even in the absence of}} antibiotic pressure. In contrast Lebek and Egger (1983), studying the same strains in vitro, found that in a chemostat the plasmid bearing strain was overgrown by the plasmid free strain. These results strongly suggest that in vitro interactions between E. coli strains cannot be directly extrapolated to in vivo conditions. For the determination of the <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> of antibiotic residue on the selection of R-factor in the gut, studies should be made in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Validation of {{alternative}} assays requires {{comparison of the}} responses to toxicants in the alternative assay with in vivo responses. Chemicals have been classified as "positive" or "negative" in vivo, {{despite the fact that}} developmental toxicity is conditional on magnitude of exposure. We developed a list of positive and negative developmental exposures, with exposure defined by toxicokinetic data, specifically maternal plasma Cmax. We selected a series of 20 chemicals that caused developmental toxicity and for which there were appropriate toxicokinetic data. Where possible, we used the same chemical for both positive and negative exposures, the positive being the Cmax at a dose level that produced significant teratogenicity or embryolethality, the negative being the Cmax at a dose level not causing developmental toxicity. It was not possible to find toxicokinetic data at the <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> for all positive compounds, and the negative exposure list contains Cmax values for some compounds that do not have developmental toxicity up to the highest dose level tested. This exposure-based reference list represents a fundamentally different approach to the evaluation {{of alternative}} tests and is proposed as a step toward application of alternative tests in quantitative risk assessment...|$|R
