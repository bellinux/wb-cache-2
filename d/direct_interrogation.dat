40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that anagrams are solved {{by means of}} an interrogation of the lexicon on the basis of an orthographically regular subsequence of the letters given. This study was concerned with the effect upon the solution process of providing the semantic category that contained the solution. In this situation, the instance dominance of the solution in the specified category affected the solution time for anagrams drawn from small categories, but the number of letters in the anagrams did not. For anagrams drawn from large categories, the reverse was true. Moreover, cuing with the appropriate taxonomic category produced a significant reduction in solution time in the case of items from small categories, but not in the case of items from large categories. It is concluded that subjects employ a semantically <b>directed</b> <b>interrogation</b> of the lexicon when they are cued with a small category, but a structurally <b>directed</b> <b>interrogation</b> of the lexicon otherwise...|$|R

40|$|In many neurons, {{subthreshold}} depolarization in the soma can transiently increase action-potential (AP) -evoked neurotransmission via analog-to-digital facilitation. The mechanisms underlying {{this form}} of short-term synaptic plasticity are unclear, in part, due to the relative inaccessibility of the axon to <b>direct</b> physiological <b>interrogation.</b> Using voltage imaging and patch-clamp recording from presynaptic boutons of cerebellar stellate interneurons, we observed that depolarizing somatic potentials readily spread into the axon, resulting in AP broadening, increased spike-evoked Ca 2 + entry, and enhanced neurotransmission strength. Kv 3 channels, which drive AP repolarization, rapidly inactivated upon incorporation of Kv 3. 4 subunits. This leads to fast susceptibility to depolarization-induced spike broadening and analog facilitation independent of Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinase C signaling. The spread of depolarization into the axon was attenuated by hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih currents) in the maturing cerebellum, precluding analog facilitation. These results suggest that analog-to-digital facilitation is tempered by development or experience in stellate cells...|$|R

Deciphering the prevalence and functional impact of this post-transcriptional control layer requires technologies for disrupting RREs without perturbing cellular homeostasis.

We use GenERA to survey the entire regulatory landscape of a 3 ’UTR, and apply it in a multiplex fashion to analyse combinatorial interactions between sets of miRNA response elements (MREs), providing strong evidence for cooperative activity. We also employ this technology to probe the functionality of an entire MRE network under cellular homeostasis, and show that high-resolution analysis of the GenERA dataset {{can be used to}} extract functional features of MREs.

However, histones themselves can also be dynamic, which potentially affects the stability of histone modifications. To determine the molecular mechanisms of histone turnover, we developed a parallel screening method for epigenetic regulators by analyzing chromatin states on DNA barcodes. Histone turnover was quantified by employing a genetic pulse-chase technique called RITE, which was combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing. In this screen, the NuB 4 /HAT-B complex, containing the conserved type B histone acetyltransferase Hat 1, was found to promote histone turnover. Unexpectedly, the three members of this complex could be functionally separated from each other as well as from the known interacting factor and histone chaperone Asf 1.

Critics pointed out that the APA declined to advise its members not to participate in such interrogations. One group of psychologists in particular, Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, has been very harsh in its criticism of the APA stance on its refusal to categorically prohibit members from participating in any phase of military interrogations.

Here, we describe a genetically encoded mTORC 1 activity reporter (TORCAR) that exhibits a change in FRET in response to phosphorylation by mTORC 1. Co-imaging mTORC 1 activity and calcium dynamics revealed that a growth-factor-induced calcium transient contributes to mTORC 1 activity. Dynamic activity maps generated {{with the use of}} subcellularly targeted TORCAR uncovered mTORC 1 activity not only in cytosol and at the lysosome but also in the nucleus and at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, a wide distribution of activities was observed upon growth factor stimulation, whereas leucine ester, an amino acid surrogate, induces more compartmentalized activities at the lysosome and in the nucleus.

Here, we present the biochemical characterization of several MspJI homologs, including FspEI, LpnPI, AspBHI, RlaI, and SgrTI. All of the enzymes specifically recognize cytosine C 5 modification (methylation or hydroxymethylation) in DNA and cleave at a constant distance (N 12 /N 16) away from the modified cytosine. Each displays its own sequence context preference, favoring different nucleotides flanking the modified cytosine. By cleaving {{on both sides of}} fully modified CpG sites, they allow the extraction of 32 -base long fragments around the modified sites from the genomic DNA. These enzymes provide powerful tools for <b>direct</b> <b>interrogation</b> of the epigenome. For example, we show that RlaI, an enzyme that prefers mCWG but not mCpG sites, generates digestion patterns that differ between plant and mammalian genomic DNA, highlighting the difference between their epigenomic patterns.

40|$|A {{new method}} to measure {{growth rates of}} {{individual}} photoautotrophic cells by combining stable isotope probing (SIP) and single-cell resonance Raman microspectrometry is introduced. This report explores optimal experimental design and the theoretical underpinnings for quantitative responses of Raman spectra to cellular isotopic composition. Resonance Raman spectra of isogenic cultures of the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp., grown in 13 C-bicarbonate revealed linear covariance between wavenumber (cm− 1) shifts in dominant carotenoid Raman peaks and {{a broad range of}} cellular 13 C fractional isotopic abundance. Single-cell growth rates were calculated from spectra-derived isotopic content and empirical relationships. Growth rates among any 25 cells in a sample varied considerably; mean coefficient of variation, CV, was 29 ± 3 % (σ/x¯), of which only ~ 2 % was propagated analytical error. Instantaneous population growth rates measured independently by in vivo fluorescence also varied daily (CV ≈ 53 %) and were statistically indistinguishable from single-cell growth rates at all but the lowest levels of cell labeling. SCRR censuses of mixtures prepared from Synechococcus sp. and T. pseudonana (a diatom) populations with varying 13 C-content and growth rates closely approximated predicted spectral responses and fractional labeling of cells added to the sample. This approach enables <b>direct</b> microspectrometric <b>interrogation</b> of isotopically- and phylogenetically-labeled cells and detects as little as 3 % changes in cellular fractional labeling.
