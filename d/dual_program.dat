In other words, we would like the sum of all right hand side of the constraints to be the maximal under the condition that for each primal variable the sum of its coefficients do not exceed its coefficient in the linear function. For example, x1 appears in n+1 constraints. If we sum its constraints' coefficients we get a1,1y1+a1,2y2+...+a1,nyn+f1s1. This sum must be at most c1. As a result, we get: ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on {{decision}} makers′ goal-seeking {{and compromise}} behavior, this paper proposes a constructive approach to duality of a fuzzy multiple criteria and multiple constraint level (MC 2) linear programming problem. For a given MC 2 problem, both its fuzzy primal and <b>dual</b> <b>programs</b> {{are defined as}} the problems with fuzzy optimal objectives. We first use the MC 2 -simplex method to locate sets of potential solutions of maximum and minimum MC 2 problems for primal and <b>dual</b> <b>programs,</b> respectively. Then, we construct separate membership functions for primal and <b>dual</b> <b>programs.</b> For each program, a set of fuzzy potential solutions is determined {{in terms of the}} membership function and "primal" potential bases with certain ranges of decision parameters. Finally, using the primal and dual membership functions, we construct several fuzzy weak duality functions for any pair of primal and dual fuzzy potential solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Given the {{production}} technology of a multiproduct firm, economists usually try to represent this technology by functions, namely the cost function, the revenue function and the {{input and output}} distance functions. In doing so the analysis directs the attention to the (dual) matching of quantities and prices. Here, the duality scheme is based on Mahler’s inequality and stresses dual aspects of associated functions, whereas the underlying optimization problems are not <b>dual</b> <b>programs.</b> Nevertheless, the discussion of shadow pricing reveals the similarities which exist with respect to some appropriately chosen <b>dual</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{increase}} college readiness among high school graduates to promote college success and degree attainment (Blume 2 ̆ 6 Zumeta, 2013; McMahon, 2009; Reindl, 2007). Sixty percent of first semester college students are not college ready and prepared to succeed in college (National Center for Public Policy on Higher Education, 2010). <b>Dual</b> enrollment <b>programs</b> are a noted pathway {{to increase}} college readiness among high school students (Hoffman, 2003; Pretlow 2 ̆ 6 Wathington, 2014). Forty-seven states have dual enrollment policies. New York has no statewide policy and <b>dual</b> enrollment <b>programs</b> vary among public high schools throughout the state. This descriptive study examined <b>dual</b> enrollment <b>programs</b> in public high schools in New York.
