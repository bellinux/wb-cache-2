50|$|The {{first to}} fully {{automate}} publishing. By working with Lotus Software, CNNfn {{was the first}} to use a database back-end system to automate the work flow of a publishing system. At that time, even the Wall Street Journal, another startup, used web masters to hand convert articles from the editors into HTML and to get them approved by hand through e-mail or visual confirmation from a manager. The web master would then post the story onto the website and edit the referring page to add a link to the new document. CNNfn worked with Lotus's Domino product to fully automate the <b>draft,</b> <b>approval,</b> and publishing of its articles. The website was completely automated in re-writing its static home page with the latest stories. As an industry first, this method was published in a few major magazines and studies by others. Within months after its initial deployment, CNN revamped its own website's publishing methods and reduced its webmasters from 15 to 3.|$|E

40|$|As {{the first}} stage in the {{rulemaking}} process, MSHA prepared requirements for the approval and use of permissible explosives and blasting items in underground coal mines. These draft requirements known as "preproposals " were announced in the Federal Register in mid- 1984. The draft requirements {{on the use of}} explosives were written as a revision to Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 75, Subpart:N. The draft requirements for approval of permissible explosives including sheathed explosives for unconfined applications, approval of water stemming bags, approval of detonators and approval of blasting machines were prepared as Parts 15, 16, 17 and 25 respectively. During the development and preparation of the preproposals, it was determined that field research on delay blasting of coal would be needed before the <b>draft</b> <b>approval</b> and use requirements could be finalized. In order to conduct the field research, an experimental site was acquired by the Bureau of Mines. The Bureau of Mines under a contract, obtained a surface coal mine site in Ohio to conduct field research on the delay blasting of coal. The major objective of the research program was to study total elapsed delay time for blasting bituminous coal and determine if it could be safely expanded beyond the present 500 millisecond limitations without igniting a methane or methane/ coal dust atmosphere. The preliminary results from the work completed to date indicate that the increase of total delay from 500 to 1000 milliseconds has no detectable effect on safety relative to incendivity as long as permissible practices are observed in all other aspects. Further testing and assessment of the data are needed to validate the observations and conclusions reported in this paper and to establish a firm basis for regulatory changes. The research program discussed in this paper is continuing...|$|E

The revisions explicitly recognize the central, powerful, and multidimensional role of the prosecutor and attempt to respond accurately and realistically to the needs and demands of that role. As the <b>drafting</b> and <b>approval</b> process continues, certain specific areas need greater clarification and thus should be discussed and contextualized in accompanying commentary.

Aside from some rudimentary quantitative analysis, a critical discourse analysis method is utilised to compare and contrast the discursive practices used in three of Australia s leading daily newspapers (The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age) with three Middle Eastern English-language papers (The Daily Star, Anadolu Agency and the Jordan Times). The paper finds that the Australian print media continues the neo-Orientalist tradition of media coverage of Middle Eastern democracy, while the Middle Eastern press eschews these discourses in favour of a more open, varied debate on Iraq s constitution {{and the future of}} democracy across the region. <br /...|$|R

The <b>draft</b> type <b>approval</b> specification document [1] which details the lower limit of detection (LLD) for potential RSDD’s gives a LLD of 1 x 10 - 7 M for amfetamine sulfate.
