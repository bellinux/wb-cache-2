Eckert argues that Kyungbang relied on Japan for its raw materials, machinery, and technical expertise. Furthermore, Eckert argues that Kyungbang's support of the Japanese ideology of Naisen Ittai, which stressed the unity of Japanese and Korean peoples, reveals that the Korean bourgeois had a weak commitment to Korean nationalism.|$|E

40|$|The Latvian Organic Agriculture Association (LBLA) marked its ten year {{anniversary this}} year, {{one year after}} joining the European Union (EU). In these ten years, the number of {{certified}} or transition period organic farms has grown from 38 to almost 3000, with two thirds of that growth occurring since EU accession.

This paper analyzes the effects of EU accession from the farmers' perspective, and reveals that the implementation of EU regulations in the Latvian post-socialist context often has unintended consequences due to the complex interaction of EU and Latvian administrative processes, differences in farmers' experiences and expectations, and the dilapidated state of existing rural infrastructure. These findings raise crucial questions about how current EU policies and support structures will assist or hinder farmers in new member states in <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> in European organic agriculture and contributing to sustainable rural development...|$|E

B. subtilis are also beneficial to plants in that they promote plant growth through phytohormones production, sequestration of nutrients, stimulation of systemic induced resistance in plants and suppression of plant pathogen activities [26],[29]-[31]. Antimicrobial metabolites from B. subtilis have been employed in biocontrol and plant protection by exploiting their antibiosis activity on phytopathogens [32]. These compounds also stimulate the plant’s defense systems to pathogens by inducing systemic resistance in bean, Phaseolus vulgarus, and tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, [33],[34]. Hence, B. subtilis can increase plant ecological fitness through sustained colonization of the rhizosphere [35].

Additionally, the state-owned Afriqiyah Airlines had been <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> hub in Tripoli before the 2011 war, but this development has subsequently been stalled. Against this background, we analyse the prospects of an air transport hub operation in Libya, focusing on traffic between Africa and Europe, from a bird’s-eye economic–geographic view. First, a literature review is undertaken to identify general success factors for air transport hubs. Second, a weighted average distance penalty (WADP) indicator is developed and applied to Tripoli as a potential hub location. This indicator considers all 4755 O&Ds between Europe and Africa with more than 100 passengers in 2012. For sensitivity reasons, alternative WADPs are estimated for the 3209 traffic flows not including North Africa and for (forecasted) future air traffic demand in 2020. The results for Tripoli International Airport are benchmarked against competing hub locations, such as Algiers, Cairo, and the major European airports.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} {{parasitic}} nematode Trichinella spiralis is initiated when the L 1 larva invades host intestinal epithelial cells. Monoclonal antibodies specific for glycans on the larval surface and secreted glycoproteins protect the intestine against infection. Protective antibodies recognize tyvelose which caps the target glycan. In this study, we used an in vitro model of invasion to further examine the mechanism(s) by which tyvelose-specific antibodies protect epithelial cells against T. spiralis. Using cell lines that vary in susceptibility to invasion, we confirmed and clarified {{the results of}} our in vivo studies by documenting three modes of interference: exclusion of larvae from cells, encumbrance of larvae as they migrated within epithelial monolayers, and inhibition of parasite development. Excluded larvae bear cephalic caps (C. S. McVay et al., Infect. Immun. 66 : 1941 – 1945, 1998) of immune complexes that may physically block invasion or may interfere with sensory reception. Monovalent Fab fragments prepared from a tyvelose-specific antibody also excluded larvae from cells, demonstrating that antibody binding can inhibit the parasite in the absence of antigen aggregation and cap formation. In contrast, encumbered larvae caused extensive damage to the monolayer yet were not successful in <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche,</b> as reflected by their failure to molt. These results show that antibodies to tyvelose exhibit multiple modes of inhibitory activity, further implicating tyvelose-bearing glycoproteins as mediators of invasion and niche establishment by T. spiralis...|$|E

In order to do so, the authors explored how the Swales’ model is applied in writing a research article introduction. The exploration was approached through a library study on the Swales model application. Some previous studies applying Swales Model were gathered and categorized into three categories − application of Swales model on different types of genre besides the research article introduction, different discipline or field and the last is the application of Swales’ on the research article introduction across languages. Another three articles written by professional writers were also collected as samples of introductions that have successfully presented three obligatory moves – establishing a territory (Move 1), <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> (Move 2) and occupying the niche or {{presenting the present work}} (Move 3) − proposed by Swales’ model. Those introductions were segmented into those three moves and analyzed based on a communication purpose in every step derived from each move. In order to add more comprehension about the model, an analysis was also conducted on introductions for seven articles in the English Education Journal (EEJ) published by the Graduate Program in English Language Education at Syiah Kuala University. The purpose of the analysis was to show the differences in structure of introductions organized without following the CARS Swales model. Conclusions are that the CARS Swales model is relevant for the teaching of introductions for research writing and it can be a guideline to teach students the moves and steps of this model for communication purposes...|$|E

30|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{population}} in the world are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), If untreated, one in ten latent infection will progress into active tuberculosis (TB) disease with about 50 % mortality rate. According to the WHO report, an estimated 8.6 million people developed TB, and 1.3 million died from the disease (including 320, 000 deaths among HIV-positive TB patients) in 2012. Furthermore, the global estimate of the burden of MDR-TB was 300, 000 cases among notified TB patients in 2012. India and China were the two countries estimated to have the largest numbers of MDR-TB patients (both over 50, 000) (Bogdan, 2000; Gonzalez-Navajas et al., 2012; WHO, 2013). As an intracellular pathogen, Mtb lives in macrophages, which act as the first line of immune defense for Mtb by clearing the pathogen. In the progress of cellular immunity against Mtb, macrophages also function as antigen presenting cells, in which the antigens of Mtb are degraded into immunogenic polypeptides and presented to T cell by major histocompatibility complex to trigger adaptive immunity. In turn, through long battles with host, Mtb has developed a plethora of strategies to counteract the bactericidal activities of the host immunity, thereby successfully <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> for long-term survival within macrophages (Jayachandran et al., 2013). The battles between Mtb and macrophages have been constant since ancient times and become more complicated with the appearance of drug-resistant Mtb, especially the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively-drug resistant (XDR) Mtb (Guirado et al., 2013; Warner and Mizrahi, 2013). In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the interactions between Mtb and macrophages, focusing on cellular fates of the infected macrophages and the regulatory molecules and cellular pathways involved in those processes.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} part of the authors’ {{bachelor}} degree in International Marketing and analyzes the Canadian vitamins and dietary supplements (VDS) industry. Based on this analysis, the authors will be proposing how Vigour can enter the market. Vigour Health was founded in 2006 by Omar Paulsen Bekheet and John Ivar Andre and the goal was to introduce a new lifestyle concept that should be inventive in its approach. Vigour utilizes raw materials from the northern parts of Norway, and produces prescription-free, unique dietary supplements from perhaps the cleanest environment in the world. The company wants to export its Arctic Seaweed Complex series (ASC) to Canada, which has the following products in its portfolio: Pure:DETOX, Daily:PROTECTION and Figure:BALANCE. However, Vigour is currently in the process of launching their products in Norway and has therefore a rather limited budget to support their market entry in Canada. The first section of the report describes the research problem, research objectives and methodology. It further outlines more about Vigour and the company’s strengths and weaknesses, before it describes the Canadian VDS industry with an emphasis on distribution channels. Based on the findings, the authors have identified different courses of action and make a recommendation {{at the end of the}} report. Methodology The report is based on both primary and secondary data. Secondary sources that were used consist of online articles, books, newspapers and reports. Due to a highly competitive industry and the number of the existing distribution channels, primary research was also conducted in order to outline the process behind getting new products into a retailer’s products portfolio. This was completed through interviews by phone and in person with different members of the industry. A focus group was also conducted to discover people’s opinions regarding consumer behaviour related to VDS, using Norway as a country of origin and market trends. Main findings from the analysis Total sales of VDS in Canada were estimated at $ 861 million in 2006, which represented a moderate growth compared with 2005. In recent years, many Canadians have become more health conscious and are changing their lifestyles in regards to exercise and nutrition. Canadians are attempting to stay healthy by adding vitamins and herbal remedies to their routines and 30 % of Canadians take VDS products on a daily basis. 50 % of the population in British Columbia (B. C.) use VDS products regularly and the province is considered to be the most health conscious in Canada. In Canada, vitamins and dietary supplements are sold through different retail channels, including supermarket chains, drugstores, speciality stores and online. After investigating a broad range of distribution channels, the most suitable are outlined in the report. These consist of the wholesalers/drugstores London Drugs and Katz Group; food/drugstores Capers and Pharmamart; speciality stores Nutrition House, GNC and Unique Nutrition; and two online retailers: Cureself and Nature’s Essence Health Products Inc. The Canadian VDS industry is a difficult business to operate in and is recognized by the industry’s competitive environment along with retailer’s high bargaining power. The main findings from the analysis have confirmed this claim and the choice of distribution channels seems to be the main issue when entering the Canadian market. By choosing traditional retail, there are many additional costs and Vigour would be left with little or no control over their products. Furthermore, big competitors such as Jamison and Greens occupy large sections of the shelves in these stores and it is difficult for a little company to stick out. Hence the importance of differentiation and to <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> strategy will be crucial in order to succeed in Canada. Recommendation After analyzing the Canadian VDS industry and making the discovery that the choice of a distribution channel is critical, the authors have outlined three different courses of action in which to enter the market. The first option executes mass retail by entering through London Drugs and Katz Group, which will expose Vigour’s products to a big customer base, but will acquire financial investments and leave the company with no control. The second alternative, premium retail, is carried out by offering Vigour’s products at Capers and through two unconventional retailers; Lululemon and Helly Hansen. This strategy would be excellent in terms of reaching the target market and will give Vigour a more exclusive image. The last option consists of opening a fully owned store at one of Vancouver’s busiest shopping streets along with offering the products online. The store will, in addition to retail Vigour’s products, operate as an information centre and promotion tool in order to create buzz about the brand and positive word of mouth. To execute this strategy, Vigour should line up with a partner. Based on their exclusive image, Voss Water is recommended. By evaluating these ways of entering the Canadian market, the authors believe an exclusive retail and online store is the most profitable option. This recommendation is not only based on financial calculations, but also on the fact that this strategy will give Vigour full control over distribution. Furthermore, by executing this niche strategy, Vigour will be able to build an exclusive brand and operate as an “all embracing lifestyle company”...|$|E
40|$|As China’s {{economy has}} grown and {{personal}} income has risen {{over the past}} decade, spending on landscaping and public works projects has increased dramatically, and with it China’s demand for treated softwood lumber. New luxury residential developments commonly include traditional Chinese landscape design, which includes man-made lakes and waterways traversed by footbridges and flanked by wooden fences, gazebos, and pavilions with decks. Government projects to revitalize shopping areas and tourist destinations has boosted demand for high-quality US treated southern yellow pine (SYP) lumber used to build walkways, bridges, stages, and landscaping elements. Treated softwood lumber {{is a relatively new}} product in China, yet imports have increased steadily over the past several years. However, as demand for treated softwood lumber has increased, the number of domestic wood treaters has also increased. These new Chinese lumber treaters pose a competitive threat because many produce poor quality treated lumber which threatens to undermine the good reputation that US treated SYP has established. This research is intended to provide US suppliers with a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market and strategic marketing recommendations. This report is based on information collected through interviews with treating plant managers, softwood lumber distributors, and other industry experts. Additional information was collected from surveys completed by Chinese architects, distributors, and other construction professionals. The report consists of four parts: 1) an overview of the China’s wood preserving industry, 2) a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market, 3) results of surveys about user perceptions and attitudes about various treated softwood lumber species used in China, and 4) strategic implications for US manufacturers, exporters and industry associations. Key findings include the following: 1) China’s treated softwood lumber market is extremely competitive and price dependent. The majority of the treated lumber used in China is supplied by local treaters offering low prices. Russian pine treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) {{is by far the most}} widely used treated softwood lumber species in China, due to its low price. However, imported and Chinese treated US SYP is quickly <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>niche</b> in high-quality market segments and many Chinese treaters report that they would buy as much untreated US SYP as they have access to. The majority of treated SYP from the US is used in government-funded projects where interest in quality and durability is more important than low price. 2) Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) is the most widely used treating chemical used by Chinese treaters. A growing number of Chinese treaters have started to use Alkaline Copper Quatenary (ACQ) and several are developing their own environmentally responsible treating chemicals. Since China has no regulations governing the preservative treated lumber industry, most Chinese treaters develop their own chemicals or dilute purchased preservatives to reduce costs, and the quality and durability of lumber treated with these chemicals is reportedly poor. As China’s government enacts more environmental standards and as more Chinese manufacturers follow international environmental standards as a means of accessing international markets, interest in environmentally-friendly treating chemicals should increase. Survey responses indicate that Chinese construction professionals rate the importance of environmentally-friendly treating chemicals fourth highest in a list of ten quality and service attributes associated with preservative treated softwood lumber. With no regulatory body however, the majority of Chinese treaters will likely use substandard preservative treating chemicals and treating procedures to keep product costs low. 3) According to survey results, US treated SYP has established a reputation as a high-quality, durable and environmentally-friendly building material. As stated above, since China has no standards governing proper treating methods and chemicals, and no testing body to ensure the quality and durability of domestic treated lumber, US industry representatives are concerned that domestically treated softwood lumber may erode the reputation of US treated SYP. 4) While survey respondents rated softwood species from the western US highly, Chinese treaters have negative perceptions about the species. Primary concerns were that Douglas-fir lumber does not absorb preservative treating chemicals completely and the ends require re-treating if the lumber is sawn after initial treating. Conversely, treaters were resistant to using Hem-fir because it absorbs preservative treating chemicals too readily, which increases the price of treating. 5) According to interviews with Chinese lumber treaters and softwood lumber distributors, US exporters face several barriers to expanding their market share in China. The most significant of these obstacles is that most consumers do not understand the differences in performance and durability between imported US treated softwood lumber and less expensive domestically treated lumber. Second, US suppliers continue to face obstacles associated with not providing lumber in metric sizes. Finally, Chinese distributors report that not having ready access to US lumber prices hampers their ability to quote prices as readily as suppliers of domestic treated lumber. 6) Environmental regulations in China are few and enforcement is inconsistent. However, the Chinese government is reportedly investigating the feasibility of reducing environmental pollution by imposing legislative and economic measures on “dirty” industries. Industry experts anticipate that new environmental regulations applied to the Chinese wood treating industry may improve the competitiveness of US preservative treated lumber compared to locally treated lumber. 7) China’s distribution system for softwood lumber is regionally fragmented with hundreds of thousands of distributors, trading markets, and sales outlets across the country. This regional fragmentation makes it important for US suppliers to work with distributors in several regions of China or with a distributor who has a network of regional representatives. Chinese distributors who have become recognized as experts with a basic understanding of wood frame design and softwood lumber performance characteristics have gained a competitive edge over their less knowledgeable competitors. 8) As manufacturers and distributors work to differentiate themselves from their competition, survey respondents report an interest in naturally decay resistant and lesser used species such as Alaska yellow cedar, Sitka spruce and western red cedar from the western US and Canada. The US softwood lumber industry has been successful in developing the Chinese market for preservative treated softwood lumber. To a large degree, this success has been based on educational programs that have raised construction professional’s awareness of the superior performance and durability of softwood lumber that has been properly treated to international wood treating standards. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that there is a brand awareness of US preservative treated southern yellow pine as the “gold standard” of treated softwood lumber products in the Chinese market. Like any successful branding effort, the rapid development of the preservative treated softwood lumber market has spawned low-cost domestically treated products with inferior performance and poor durability. Often, domestically treated SYP is marketed as US-treated SYP. In other cases, pine from South America is marketed as US SYP. In a price sensitive market like China, where markets tend to move towards a commodity focus, it is hardly surprising that these domestically treated, low-priced products have gained a surprising degree of market success. The success of these inferior treated lumber products threatens to undermine the entire market for treated softwood lumber if consumers associate the poor performance and low durability of this domestically produced inferior treated lumber with all treated softwood lumber. To the extent that US preservative lumber manufacturers and exporters allow the commoditization of treated softwood lumber, they stand the risk of having US treated lumber be subject to consumer perceptions based on the poor quality of domestic Chinese treated lumber. From a marketing perspective, it becomes important that the US industry adopt a branding strategy that allows consumers and end-users to differentiate high quality US treated lumber from low quality domestically treated lumber. Thus, it is imperative that the US treated lumber industry work with industry associations and their Chinese distributors to implement a promotion and education strategy to differentiate US preservative treated lumber from competing products. Fundamentally, this marketing strategy would help prevent the commoditization of US treated lumber in the Chinese market and ensure that the poor performance of domestically treated lumber in China does not adversely affect the reputation or demand for US treated lumber. Failure to do this would seriously jeopardize the market for US treated lumber in China...|$|E
