40|$|We {{analyze the}} organic and {{non-organic}} production choices of two firms by considering customers’ trust in organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> In {{the context of}} customers’ possible willingness {{to pay a premium}} price and their mistrust in organic <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> two firms first make choices on offering organic and non-organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> If offering organic products, a firm can further invest in the credence system to increase customers’ trust in their organic products. At the final stage, two firms determine prices. We provide serval insights. First, we characterize the market conditions in which only one firm, both firms or neither firm will choose to offer organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> We find that the higher the production costs or credence investment costs for organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> are, the more likely firms are to choose to produce non-organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Second, if it is expensive enough to invest in organic credence, offering organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> may still be uncompetitive, even if organic production cost appears to have no disadvantage compared to non-organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Third, we highlight how the prices of organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> in equilibrium are affected by market parameters. We show that when only one firm offers organic <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> this firm tends to offer a relatively low price if organic credence investment is expensive. Fourth, we highlight how one firm’s credence investment decision in equilibrium can be affected by the product type choice of the other firm. We find that the investment in organic credence is lower when both firms offer organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> compared with the case when only one firm offers organic <b>food</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to determine the perception of and attitude toward probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> among college students. This study used a self-reported survey questionnaire with a random recruited sample of 304 of students from upper- and lower-division classes at CSUN. Data were collected in November 2011 and analyzed with t-test, chi-square, and correlation. The results of this study indicated no significant differences between men and women on (1) how often they consume and (2) how much they know about probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, there were no significant differences between men and women on how they defined probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Almost half of the participants could not answer the question, ???How would you define probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products????</b> The results also indicated that as participants age, they are significantly more likely to consume probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> (r=. 21, p<. 01) and hear about probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> (r=. 17, p<. 01). However, no significant correlation was found between income and consumption of or hearing about probiotic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> In conclusion, the results indicated a lack of knowledge about probiotic functional <b>food</b> <b>products</b> among the general public, even among educated consumers such as college students. Therefore, it is necessary to make more of an effort to educate the public about probiotic functional food products; there should be more studies to not only educate the public but also further investigate the benefits of these products...|$|R
