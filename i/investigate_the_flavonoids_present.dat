Oxidative stress {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown a relationship between a diet rich in flavonoid and a reduced incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Piper sarmentosum (PS) is a plant with high flavonoid content and it possesses antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic activities. Therefore this study aimed to <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in aqueous extract of PS (AEPS) and its cytoprotective effects in oxidative stress-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). AEPS contained high total phenolic content (91. 02 ± 0. 02 mg QE/g DM) and total flavonoid content (48. 57 ± 0. 03 mg GAE/g DM). Screening using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique showed the presence of rutin and vitexin as the main flavonoids in AEPS. HUVEC were exposed to 180 μM H 2 O 2 and treated with various concentrations of rutin or vitexin (10 to 400 μM) for 24 hours. Both rutin and vitexin at the concentration of 150 - 400 μM significantly increased the viability of H 2 O 2 -induced HUVEC as denoted by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Therefore rutin and vitexin as the main flavonoids present in PS may be involved in the protective effects of PS against oxidative stress...|$|E

40|$|The concept {{presented}} in this paper is the utilisation of <b>the</b> natural <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in cotton as anchors to attach other phenolic compounds to the fiber surface. Laccase can catalyze <b>the</b> oxidation of <b>flavonoids</b> in solution producing quinones that can be further polymerised and grafted onto surface of the cotton providing yellow to brown colouration, depending on <b>the</b> external <b>flavonoids</b> used and on the reaction conditions. Factors such as temperature, time of reaction, pretreatment of cotton, mechanical agitation and the role of an organic solvent were studied in order to improve this laccase colouration reaction. After dyeing, colour measurements and fastness tests (washing, friction and weathering fastness) were performed. A strong mechanical agitation, an increased reaction temperature (from 30 to 50 °C), and the addition of an organic solvent improved dyeing. <b>The</b> natural <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> on cotton were found {{to play an important role}} on the grafting reaction, improving dyeing and colour fastness.

There {{are two types of}} unsweetened cocoa powder: natural cocoa (like the sort produced by the Broma process), and Dutch-process cocoa. Both are made by pulverizing partially defatted chocolate liquor and removing nearly all the cocoa butter; Dutch-process cocoa is additionally processed with alkali to neutralize its natural acidity. Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic with a strong chocolate flavor. Natural cocoa is commonly used in recipes that also use baking soda; as baking soda is an alkali, combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking. Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste, with a deeper and warmer colour than natural cocoa. Dutch-process cocoa is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids.

The green synthesised nanoparticles size was found to be approximate to 37 nm. The BET analysis result shows that the surface area of the synthesised AgNPs was found to be 33. 72 m(2) g(- 1). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AgNPs for acne causative agent P. awes and dandruff causative agent M. furfur was found to be at 3. 1 and 25 mu g mL(- 1), respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value of the AgNPs for MCF- 7 cells was calculated as 30. 5 mu g mL(- 1) and complete inhibition was observed at a concentration of 100 mu g mL(- 1). Finally, our results proved that green synthesised AgNPs using C sativum have great potential in biomedical applications such as anti-acne, anti-dandruff and anti-breast cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Artemisia annua is {{currently}} the only commercial source of the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin. Since artemisinin was discovered as the active component of A. annua in early 1970 s, hundreds of papers {{have focused on the}} anti-parasitic effects of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogs dihydroartemisinin, artemether, arteether, and artesunate. Artemisinin per se has not been used in mainstream clinical practice due to its poor bioavailability when compared to its analogs. In the past decade, the work with artemisinin-based compounds has expanded to their anti-cancer properties. Although artemisinin is a major bioactive component present in the traditional Chinese herbal preparations (tea), leaf <b>flavonoids,</b> also <b>present</b> in <b>the</b> tea, have shown a variety of biological activities and may synergize the effects of artemisinin against malaria and cancer. However, only a few studies have focused on the potential synergistic effects between <b>flavonoids</b> and artemisinin. <b>The</b> resurgent idea that multi-component drug therapy might be better than monotherapy is illustrated by the recent resolution of the World Health Organization to support artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), instead of the previously used monotherapy with artemisinins. In this critical review we will discuss the possibility that artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogs might become more effective to treat parasitic diseases (such as malaria) and cancer if simultaneously delivered with <b>flavonoids.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in A. annua leaves have been linked to suppression of CYP 450 enzymes responsible for altering the absorption and metabolism of artemisinin in the body, but also have been linked to a beneficial immunomodulatory activity in subjects afflicted with parasitic and chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>flavonoid</b> rich {{fraction}} of Monodora tenuifolia seed on the haematology, histopathology and liver profile of Wistar albino rats. Methods: Toxicity study was <b>investigated</b> on <b>the</b> <b>flavonoid</b> rich fraction of Monodora tenuifolia in rats administered different concentrations orally for 28 d using standard laboratory procedures. Results: The LD 50 of <b>the</b> <b>flavonoid</b> rich fraction {{was found to}} be above 5000 mg/kg body weight in mice observed for 48 h. After the Day 14, biochemical markers of liver injury such as serum alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased significantly (P 0. 05). There was non-significant (P> 0. 05) effect observed across the groups in the levels of serum total protein, albumin, globulin, urea and creatinine. The result of histological examination showed various degrees of peribiliary hepatitis after the Day 14 which fizzled out after the Day 28. Conclusions: The result therefore suggests that the seed extract is potentially safe...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Brazilian Health Ministry and the World Health Organization have {{supported}} research into new technologies that {{may contribute to}} the surveillance, new treatments, and control of visceral leishmaniasis within the country. In light of this, the aim {{of this study was to}} isolate compounds from plants of the Caatinga biome, and to investigate their toxicity against promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania infantum chagasi, the main responsible parasite for South American visceral leishmaniasis, and evaluate their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE). A screen assay using luciferase-expressing promastigote form and an in situ ELISA assay were used to measure the viability of promastigote and amastigote forms, respectively, after exposure to these substances. The MTT colorimetric assay was performed to determine the toxicity of these compounds in murine monocytic RAW 264. 7 cell line. All compounds were tested in vitro for their anti-cholinesterase properties. A coumarin, scoparone, was isolated from Platymiscium floribundum stems, and <b>the</b> <b>flavonoids</b> rutin and quercetin were isolated from Dimorphandra gardneriana beans. These compounds were purified using silica gel column chromatography, eluted with organic solvents in mixtures of increasing polarity, and identified by spectral analysis. In the leishmanicidal assays, the compounds showed dose-dependent efficacy against the extracellular promastigote forms, with an EC 50 for scoporone of 21. 4 µg/mL, quercetin and rutin 26 and 30. 3 µg/mL, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>flavonoids</b> <b>presented</b> comparable results to the positive control drug, amphotericin B, against the amastigote forms with EC 50 for quercetin and rutin of 10. 6 and 43. 3 µg/mL, respectively. All compounds inhibited AChE with inhibition zones varying from 0. 8 to 0. 6, indicating a possible mechanism of action for leishmacicidal activity...|$|R
40|$|Apigenin {{is one of}} <b>the</b> plant <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in {{fruits and}} vegetables, acting as an {{important}} nutraceutical component. It is recognized as a potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory molecule. In the present study, the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of apigenin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) factors in human lung A 549 cells was <b>investigated.</b> <b>The</b> antiâinflammatory activity of apigenin on LPS-induced inflammation was determined by analyzing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), and different AP- 1 factors. Apigenin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX- 2, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 Î², IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-Î±), and AP- 1 proteins (c-Jun, c-Fos, and JunB) including nitric oxide production. Study confirms the anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory mediators and AP- 1 factors involved in the inflammation and its importance {{in the treatment of}} lung inflammatory diseases.

40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevancePiper umbellatum L., Piperaceae, is a shrub {{that grows}} up to 3 m high. It is {{commonly}} known as “capeba” or “pariparoba” in Brazil. Tea prepared using the leaves of this plant is employed in the treatment of infections and inflammatory processes in different countries. Approximately 50 compounds, notably from <b>the</b> <b>flavonoid,</b> alkaloid, terpene, and sterol classes, have been isolated from the leaves of Piper umbellatum. To evaluate the acute toxicity, antibacterial activity, and mode of action of the hydroethanolic extract of Piper umbellatum leaves (HEPu). Materials and methodsAcute toxicity of HEPu against CHO-K 1 cells was evaluated using a cytotoxicity assay with Alamar Blue and that against mice was assessed by the Hippocratic test. Antibacterial activity of HEPu was tested using the broth microdilution method using a panel of clinically relevant bacteria, and the effects of HEPu on the bacterial membrane were analyzed in detail. A preliminary phytochemical analysis based on coloration/precipitation was performed according to procedure described in the literature. Secondary metabolites detected were analyzed and confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), spectrophotometry, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ResultsPiper umbellatum {{did not appear to be}} toxic in the in vitro (IC 50 > 200 µg/mL) cytotoxicity test. When administered in vivo at doses up to 2000 mg/kg p. o., HEPu did not cause any signs or symptoms of toxicity in mice. It demonstrated a good spectrum of antibacterial activity and its mode of action appeared to be associated with changes in the permeability of bacterial membranes; it led to increased entry of hydrophobic antibiotics, efflux of K+, and nucleotide leakage. Preliminary phytochemical analysis revealed <b>the</b> presence of <b>flavonoids,</b> alkaloids, terpenes, and sterols in the extract. Spectrophotometric and HPLC analysis revealed the presence of <b>the</b> <b>flavonoids</b> rutin and quercetin. ConclusionIn summary, HEPu has antibacterial activity and low acute toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Its mode of action appears to be associated with changes in the permeability of the bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, which can at least be partly attributed to <b>the</b> <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in <b>the</b> extract...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Considering pegaga {{medicinal}} {{properties and}} over-exploitation, {{the requirement for}} a tissue culture technique as an alternative production system was crucial. Approach: Investigation of cell suspension culture response to different plant growth regulators (PRGs) for flavonoid production from elite cell line was carried out. Callus cultures were initiated from the leaf explants of Centella asiatica on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing B 5 vitamins and 30 g L− 1 sucrose supplemented with different concentrations (0. 5 - 2. 5 mg L− 1) of 2, 4 -D, NAA, Dicamba, Picloram and IBA supplied singly and in combination with different concentrations (0. 5 - 1. 5 mg L− 1) of kinetin, BAP and TDZ. Results: Callus induction was observed for all the PGRs tested. The highest callus induction frequency (86. 67 %) was observed in MS medium containing 2. 0 mg L− 1 2, 4 -D while the combination of 2. 0 mg L− 1 2, 4 -D and 1 mg L− 1 kinetin in MS medium gave the highest biomass yield (0. 27 g dry weight culture− 1). This combination was also found to be best for callus proliferation for all <b>the</b> accessions <b>investigated.</b> Among <b>the</b> four accessions tested, UPM 03 {{was found to have}} the highest biomass yield (0. 041 g DW culture− 1) and hydrolysed flavonoid content (10. 75 mg g− 1 DW) after the 12 th day of culture. <b>The</b> <b>flavonoids</b> <b>present</b> in <b>the</b> four accessions were quercetin, kaempherol, luteolin and rutin based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
