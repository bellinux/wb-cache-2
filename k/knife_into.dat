25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E
25|$|The {{worship of}} Mithras was {{widespread}} {{in much of}} the Roman Empire from the mid-2nd century CE. The Mithra cult in the Roman Empire was a syncretism of different religious motifs, centered on the god Mithras who emerges from a rock. Its closest similarities to Christianity are the story of the slaying of the bull by Mithras; a bull is captured and killed by Mithras when he plunges a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> it and from the dead bull grain and plants are produced, that symbolize life. Mithras was a solar deity, closely associated with the Roman Sol Invictus.|$|E

25|$|Four years later, having {{survived the}} attack, the Bride {{goes to the}} home of Vernita Green, {{planning}} to kill her.

25|$|Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, {{then became}} {{the leader of}} the Catholic League. League presses began {{printing}} anti-royalist tracts under a variety of pseudonyms, while the Sorbonne proclaimed that it was just and necessary to depose Henry III. In July 1589, in the royal camp at Saint-Cloud, a monk named Jacques Clément gained an audience with the King and drove a long <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> his spleen. Clément was executed on the spot, taking with him the information of who, if anyone, had hired him. On his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic Law, he named Henry as his heir.|$|E

500|$|Joe Clark succeeded Stanfield {{as party}} leader in 1976, but as Clark had {{supported}} the leadership review, Diefenbaker held a grudge against him. Diefenbaker had supported Claude Wagner for leader, but when Clark won, stated that Clark would make [...] "a remarkable {{leader of this}} party". However, Diefenbaker repeatedly criticized his party leader, {{to such an extent}} that Stanfield publicly asked Diefenbaker [...] "to stop sticking a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> Mr. Clark"—a request Diefenbaker did not agree to. According to columnist Charles Lynch, Diefenbaker regarded Clark as an upstart and a pipsqueak.|$|E

[...] Then she is transformed into one of the daughters of the air, ethereal beings who strive to earn an immortal soul by doing good deeds in the world of men.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} {{screeching}} violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled [...] "The Murder". Hitchcock {{originally intended to}} have no music for the sequence (and all motel scenes), but Herrmann insisted he try his composition. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene, and nearly doubled Herrmann's salary. The blood in the scene is reputed to have been Bosco chocolate syrup, which shows up better on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> a casaba melon.|$|E

5000|$|He was, for many, {{at least}} as well known for his {{eccentric}} lifestyle as for his art. He wore a distinctive homburg hat and carried two pistols which he called [...] "Kitty" [...] and [...] "Kitty's brother", because {{he was fond of}} shooting the tails off cats. He also had a wooden leg and would sometimes stick <b>knives</b> <b>into</b> it, through his trousers, to shock people nearby.|$|R

500|$|Much of the episode's plot {{revolves}} around a practical joke with a fake cake that Jim {{has set up}} {{in an attempt to}} fool Pat. Moving the cake reveals the head of the person hiding under the table, but, in the mean time, the hidden character can hear conversations taking place nearby, unbeknownst to those who are not in on the joke. The episode plays on viewers' guesses as to what has led to the arrival—seen {{at the opening of the}} episode—of a paramedic. In particular, the person under the table is at risk of injury if candles burn down or someone puts a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> the [...] "cake".|$|E
500|$|Emanuel {{is known}} for his [...] "take-no-prisoners style" [...] that has earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Rahmbo." [...] Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who [...] "betrayed" [...] them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> the table and began rattling off names while shouting [...] "Dead! Dead! Dead!". Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair [...] "Don't fuck this up!" [...] while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has [...] "mellowed out". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.|$|E

Two decades later, in 1882, the Run flooded, killing at least ten people. A covered bridge that once crossed Pogue's Run was eventually destroyed.|$|R
60|$|Of all the ingenious {{and cruel}} satires {{that from the}} {{beginning}} till now have been stuck like <b>knives</b> <b>into</b> womankind, surely {{there is not one}} so lacerating to them, and to us who love them, as the trite old fact, that the most wretched of men can, in the twinkling of an eye, find a wife ready to be more wretched still {{for the sake of his}} company.|$|R
500|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of word-based scenarios {{presented to the}} player through the narration of the main character, Serge. As the narrative progresses, the game presents a list of possible actions and the player must choose his or her course. Depending on the choices made, the player may enter a new area, be presented with a new situation or character, or have to choose again if the previous selection was incorrect. In combat with enemies, the player must select from options such as [...] "Fight", [...] "Magic", [...] "Run", and often more complex situational commands like [...] "Run my <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> the goblin's chest!" [...] or [...] "Quickly slash at its hand!". Some decisions must be made before an invisible timer runs out; in combat, hesitation results in injury or death. Serge's health is tracked by an invisible point count, restored by various events (such as finding a potion). The game also tracks Kid's affection for Serge, influenced by battles and scripted events. Her feelings determine whether Serge survives the story's climactic fight.|$|E
500|$|Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie {{talks about}} Pat's [...] "frozen willies"—novelty ice cubes—as a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about {{becoming}} her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that [...] "he knows". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela {{is still under}} the table, but Angela enters from the kitchen, and reveals that she left to buy a real cake—the story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie {{wants to talk to}} her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, is electrocuted, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down the stairs with bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, an irregularly shaped {{portion of}} {{sidewalk}} (which {{had previously been}} home to a tree) was called the [...] "sacred potato," [...] and {{was the focus of}} a number of rituals and superstitions: one should never step on it if one had a test that same day; sticking a <b>knife</b> <b>into</b> a potato on the spot at midnight warded off a failing grade. Stepping on the sacred potato had been rumored to cause one to either fail their next test or become pregnant. Around 2002, campus facilities replaced the sidewalk, sparking student complaints.|$|E
