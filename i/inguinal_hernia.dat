30|$|Anatomically, {{there is}} a closed {{relation}} between the spermatic cord structures and <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias.</b> <b>Inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> can carry the risk of ischemia of the testis by an intermittent mechanical compression (pressure) on the testicular vessels (Fitzgibbons 2007; Turgut et al. 2007). In some report, color doppler ultrasonography showed that preoperatively {{there was a significant}} elevation in the sonographic resistive index (RI) in the affected (hernia) side compared with the normal side (Beddy et al. 2006). On the other hand, Munoz Sanchez concluded that the uncomplicated <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> do not cause any significant alterations in the arterial circulation of the testicle (Abramson et al. 1978; Muñoz Sánchez et al. 2005).|$|R

25|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernia,</b> the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause.

25|$|In short, {{the descent}} of the testes {{consists}} of {{the opening of a}} connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> {{have been}} treated {{traditionally}} with open methods of herniorrhaphy or hernioplasty.

All patients> 18 years of age presenting with <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> were given the choice of laparoscopic repair or open repair.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{confirm the}} {{advantages}} of simultaneous repair of bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias,</b> indicate that it is feasible to perform the procedure under local anesthesia, and suggest that when an open tension-free technique is used, the results are superior to those of laparoscopic repair of bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias.</b> SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Between 1971 and 1995, simultaneous repair of bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> were performed in 2953 men. Initially, between 1971 and 1984, patients with indirect hernias underwent the traditional tissue approximation repair. Those with direct hernias had the same procedure, with the repair additionally buttressed by a sheet of Marlex mesh (Davol, Inc., Cronston, RI). Between 1984 and 1995, both direct and indirect hernias were repaired using the open tension-free hernioplasty procedure. METHOD: The 2953 patients underwent simultaneous repair of bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> under local anesthesia in a private practice setting in general hospitals. RESULTS: In those {{cases in which the}} "tension free" technique was used, patients experienced minimal to mild postoperative pain and had a short recovery period, with a recurrence rate of 0. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Uncomplicated bilateral <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> in adults are best treated simultaneously. It is feasible to perform the operation under local anesthesia, and when an open tension-free repair is used, postoperative pain and recovery periods are equally comparable with those of laparoscopic repair, although the complication and the recurrence rates are significantly less...|$|R
25|$|In October1862, at {{the height}} of his popularity, Creighton injured himself in a game when he {{suffered}} a ruptured abdominal hernia hitting a home run.

25|$|Femoral hernias occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They {{can be hard to}} distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose Sliding <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> {{represent}} {{a small proportion}} of <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> but become more common with advancing age. The most recent review is based on a series published over 50 years ago. There are, however, many case reports of unusual presentations in girls. Methods We performed a review of a prospectively kept electronic record of all operations performed at Logan Hospital since 2003 in order to document the clinical characteristics of sliding <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> in the twenty-Wrst century. Results Thirty-one males underwent predominantly anterior repair of a sliding hernia after a median of 9 months of symptoms (2. 9 % of all hernia repairs- 32 / 1, 092). Approximately two-thirds of hernias were left sided. There were Wve minor and two technical complications. Follow-up ranged from 3 weeks to 3 years. Two recurrences have been repaired.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{recurrence}} rates after nonprosthetic methods for the repair of <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias,</b> like McVay, Bassini or Shouldice techniques, are high (6 – 10 %). Since 20 years, we are convinced, in the GREPA-EHS group, about the advantages of the use of a prosthetic mesh in majority of patients for repairs of primary or recurrent <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias</b> and incisional hernias. We describe our typical technique for the cure of all <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernias.</b> We place a large supple mesh, by open inguinal route, posterior to the transversalis fascia and anterior to the peritoneum. We have made a double modification in the initial technique of Rives - the use of a very large unsplit prosthesis (15 × 17 cm) and the parietalization of the spermatic cord helped by a wide opening of the Fruchaud's orifice by diversion of the epigastric vessels. The positioning of the mesh is about the same as in the TEP technique but with the advantages of reduction in the vital laparoscopic risks and reinforcement of the wall by a short tension-free McVay technique...|$|R

2500|$|By far {{the most}} common hernias (up to 75% of all {{abdominal}} hernias) are the so-called inguinal hernias. Inguinal hernias are further divided into the more common indirect <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernia</b> (2/3, depicted here), in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance (the internal inguinal ring), and the direct <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernia</b> type (1/3), where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in {{the back wall of}} the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias are {{the most common type of}} hernia in both men and women. In some selected cases, they may require surgery. [...] There are special cases in which the hernia may contain both direct and indirect hernia simultaneously pantaloon hernia, or, though very rare, may contain simultaneous indirect hernias.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} the testes are {{identified}} preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. An incision is made over the inguinal canal. The testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues ("mobilized"), and brought into the scrotum. It is sutured to the scrotal tissue or enclosed in a [...] "subdartos pouch." [...] The associated passage back into the inguinal canal, an <b>inguinal</b> <b>hernia,</b> is closed to prevent re-ascent.|$|E

On exploration, the patient {{was found to be}} having a sliding hernia containing incarcerated ovary as contents on both sides. Peroperatively the contents were reduced, the sac was transfixed at its base and the redundant sac was excised. The repair of this form of hernias is more difficult because of adhesions between the contents and the wall of the sac and risk of damage during dissection. A description of this clinical presentation in the pre operative assessment and operative management are discussed in this report...|$|R
