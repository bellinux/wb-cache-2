The repairs to his back wheel took around 80 minutes, which meant that Charron assumed the race lead. de Knyff retired from the race at Glen, leaving two French cars and one Belgian car in the race.|$|E
50|$|In 873/4 the Danish Great Heathen Army overwintered at Repton, {{the only}} place in England where a winter encampment has been located, {{identified}} by a mass grave of some 250 individuals, covered by the <b>kerb</b> <b>stone</b> of its former cairn. The bones were disarticulated, long bones stacked together with skulls on top. Forensic study revealed that the individuals ranged in age from their late teens to about forty, four men to every woman. Five associated pennies fit well with the overwintering date of 873/4. The absence of injury marks suggest that the party had perhaps died from some kind of contagious disease.|$|E

For instance, during the conservation works at the Venus State Battery in 2002 a section of early granite <b>stone</b> <b>kerbing</b> and channeling was uncovered in Jardine Street {{at the entrance to}} the Battery. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a similar section of early granite <b>stone</b> <b>kerbing</b> and channeling was uncovered at the base of Towers Hill.|$|R

50|$|The great dolmen {{is located}} near the southwestern edge of the forest, south of Lancken, less than 500 metres from the Baltic Sea. The great dolmen lies in a roughly northeast-southwest oriented, {{trapezoidal}} hunebed about 35 metres long and 12.5 to 7.5 metres wide. Of the 54 <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> - including the four guardian stones - 41 have survived. The rectangular, roughly east-west oriented chamber at the wide end of the frame, with its western entrance and porch (Windfang) consists of seven supporting stones (orthostats), a half stone (Halbstein) {{the height of the}} uprights and five slabs, on which there are three large (on the chamber) and three small capstones. Only the central capstone of the chamber is missing. One of the four guardian stones at the southwest end, which had already been overturned in the past, has 40 cup marks, one of the <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> has three more. The site {{is a prime example of}} the porch dolmen (Großdolmen mit Windfang), typical of this region. A two-metre-long porch runs past the support-high half stone to the 4.0 metre long, 1.7 metre wide and 1.4 metre high chamber. The hall consists of red sandstone slabs, annealed flint and a clay floor.|$|R
50|$|Granite is {{reputed to}} have been quarried from the outcrop near Markfield in Leicestershire since Roman times. However, {{it was not until}} the 1860s that {{quarrying}} began on a commercial scale. In the late 1870s two Birmingham businessmen opened a quarry at Cliffe Hill to provide street setts and <b>kerb</b> <b>stones.</b> This quarry closed in 1887 but was revived in 1889 by Mr. J. Rupert Fitzmaurice the son of one of the original owners. Fitzmaurice equipped the quarry with then modern machinery and it quickly became a commercial success.|$|R
50|$|Little Meg (also {{known as}} the Maughanby circle) is a small circle of large <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> which {{probably}} surrounded a Bronze Age kerb cairn. It {{is close to the}} village of Langwathby to the north-east of Penrith in the English county of Cumbria and is 650 metres north-east of the more famous stone circle of Long Meg and Her Daughters. It forms part of a complex of stone circles and cairns around the Long Meg site that includes the circle at Glassonby, Old Parks, and other sites since lost.|$|R

50|$|Bus {{services}} {{have led to}} the implementation of various types of infrastructure now common in many urban and suburban settings. The most prevalent example is the ubiquitous bus stop. Large interchanges have required the building of bus stations. In roads and streets, infrastructure for buses has resulted in modifications to the kerb line such as protrusions and indentations, and even special <b>kerb</b> <b>stones.</b> Entire lanes or roads have been reserved for buses in bus lanes or busways. Bus fleets require large storage premises often located in urban areas, and may also make use of central works facilities.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the other}} {{structures}} at Ekornavallen is a probable stone cist. During its restoration a flint knife {{was found in}} the surface layer. The cairns at Ekornavallen probably date to the Bronze Age. The largest cairn has a diameter of more than 20 metres, is 2 metres high, and is surrounded by large <b>kerb</b> <b>stones.</b> The individual standing stones ("bautastones"), mark the Iron Age graves at Ekornavallen, and they are placed in an almost straight line from the north to south. The stone circles are of a type common in Sweden which were typically built in the five hundred years up to 500 AD. Their function is uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|Fire and {{in later}} times {{explosives}} were sometimes employed {{to break the}} stone into pieces of a suitable size for use in construction. Sarsen is not an ideal building material, however. William Stukeley wrote that sarsen is [...] "always moist and dewy in winter which proves damp and unwholesome, and rots the furniture". In the case of Avebury, the investors who backed a scheme to recycle the stone were bankrupted when the houses they built proved to be unsaleable and also prone to burning down. However, despite these problems, sarsen remained highly prized for its durability, being a favoured material for steps and <b>kerb</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Glassonby stone circle (actually a kerbed cairn) [...] is at OS {{reference}} NY57293934 {{on private}} land. An oval cairn {{is surrounded by}} a ring of <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> (30 stones in all, although some have been taken away and others added from field clearance over the years). Two of the stones had markings in the form of concentric rings or spirals and semi-ovoids. The stones were not set in sockets, but were supported by the cairn material. A cist was found inside the circle, which had been robbed, as well a transparent blue glass, probably a later votive offering. Outside the circle, burnt bones and an inverted collared urn were found. The bones were the remains of a man; a second cremation, without an urn, was possibly that of a woman. There are ditch marks that suggest there was a ring ditch, the terminus of a cursus. This, and the markings suggest a link to the Long Meg complex to the south-west, and to the Old Parks circle to the north-east.|$|R

50|$|Today, the cairn {{is about}} 21 m in {{diameter}} and 2.5 m high in the center. It was first excavated by Hugh Hencken of Harvard University in 1934 and has since then {{been the subject of}} repeated investigations. Hencken originally thought that the cairn was constructed in two phases over a relatively short time in the early Bronze Age (2000 to 1500 BC). It is now consensus, however, that the cairn was in fact built over a period of c. 1,800 years in three separate phases. Phase I is a polygonal stone cist made from slabs of limestone, dated to around 3500 BC (Neolithic), containing the remains of three adults and one child plus several objects. It was likely covered by a low cairn of stones with a surrounding circle of stones 10 m in diameter. Phase II took place over 1,000 years later. At that time three more burial cists were inserted into the cairn, which had previously likely collapsed partially outwards over the <b>kerb</b> <b>stones.</b> This phase, around 2000 BC, included the burial of eight people, which may have taken place {{over an extended period of}} time. The third and final phase of construction occurred over a relatively short time at some point between 1600 and 1400 BC. The original cairn was covered with a new, larger cairn surrounded with a new circle of <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> roughly 14 m in diameter. Three additional cists were inserted at that time, containing three more burials. The remains of a fourth person were found placed directly on the limestone surface of the plateau, covered with slabs and then enclosed within the expanding cairn. Thus the cairn saw burials of just 16 people over a 1,800-year period. Like at Poulnabrone dolmen, only very special people were apparently buried at this site.|$|R

5000|$|At Balnuaran of Clava itself {{there is}} a group of three Bronze Age cairns which lie close {{together}} in a line running north east to south west. The tombs at either end are of the passage grave sub-type. The central cairn is of the ring cairn sub-type, and uniquely has stone paths or causeways forming [...] "rays" [...] radiating out from the platform round the kerbs to three of the standing stones. The cairns incorporate cup and ring mark stones, carved before they were built into the structures. The <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> are graded in size and selected for colour, so that the stones are larger and redder to the south west, and smaller and whiter to the north east. All these elements seem to have been constructed as one operation and indicate a complex design rather than ad hoc additions.|$|R

But the sky against which this flag flies is not the expanse that blazes over the Golan Heights or Galilee. This is Belfast. And the community that hoisted it up was not an Israeli community living in Northern Ireland, either. Instead, it’s an emblem among all the other cultural signs that crowd this small space. This flag is in The Village, a loyalist enclave in north Belfast where Union Jacks are in plentiful supply, murals of William of Orange decorate gable walls, and the <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> are painted red, white and blue. Nothing seems further removed from Protestant Unionism and fiercely held Northern Irish links with Britain than the symbol of Israeli culture, but this isn’t an isolated display. In certain areas across Belfast, the most potent declaration of Israeli nationalism is flying high, but so out of its original context that its significance has taken on a completely different meaning.

50|$|There is a Bronze Age burial cairn at {{the summit}} of Fan Foel, and it was {{excavated}} in 2002-4 with the results published in 2014 in Archaeologia Cambrensis. The round barrow was about 16 metres (about 52 feet) wide and was badly eroded with stones from the structure removed to build a central cairn by passing walkers. Excavation of the barrow showed that it contained two separate burials, the central one in a stone cist contained the burnt bones of an adult woman and two children carbon dated to about 2000 BC. The ground surface beneath the barrow was carbon dated to about 2300 BC. The cist also contained a broken pottery food vessel decorated {{in the style of}} the Beaker people as well as a chert knife. The second burial was somewhat later and contained a broken collared urn with a rare belt hook, indicating a wealthy person. The remains of meadowsweet flowers were found in the primary cist, and may represent a wreath left with the burnt bones. The large capstone which covers the cist has been left in place in the current state of the barrow (as of October 2015). The outer <b>kerb</b> <b>stones</b> are still exposed, and show how the barrow was built. There is great similarity to the early Bronze Age barrows on the summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du, which are also exposed to show the internal cists and outer kerbstones.|$|R
