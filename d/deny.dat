5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation <b>Deny</b> Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. <b>Deny</b> Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under <b>Deny</b> Flight also {{played an important role in}} shaping the rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} of <b>Deny</b> Flight spanned {{more than two}} years of the Bosnian War and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict. The no-fly zone {{operations of}} <b>Deny</b> Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during <b>Deny</b> Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.|$|E
5|$|Until 20 September 1995, when Operation Deliberate Force ended, {{the role}} played by <b>Deny</b> Flight was minimal. After the {{suspension}} of Operation Deliberate Force; however, several further operations were carried out under <b>Deny</b> Flight. On 4 October 1995, <b>Deny</b> Flight aircraft fired HARM missiles after being targeted by surface-to-air missiles. On 8 October 1995, the UN requested close air support near Tuzla. Due to bad weather conditions, NATO aircraft were unable to locate their targets, but on 9 October, in the final combat engagement of <b>Deny</b> Flight, NATO aircraft returned and destroyed a Serb command and control bunker.|$|E

This bombing superseded Operation <b>Deny</b> Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but <b>Deny</b> Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} specification for ballistic nylon was an 18 ounce nylon fabric {{made from}} 1050 <b>denier</b> high tenacity nylon yarn in a 2×2 basketweave. Today {{the term is}} often used to refer to any nylon fabric that is made with a [...] "ballistic weave", typically a 2×2 or 2×3 basketweave. It can be woven from nylon yarns of various <b>denier</b> such as 840 <b>denier</b> and 1680 <b>denier.</b> <b>Denier</b> refers to the weight, not the strength, of the fabric. Laboratory tests have been run and the double weave 1050 <b>denier</b> fabric is the strongest and most durable fabric for its <b>denier</b> weight level. The 1680 <b>denier</b> is a good alternative that has a similar strength but lighter weight than the 1050 as it resists abrasion and tearing. Ballistic nylon is hard to dye, so it is often found in black or similar dark colors.|$|R

5|$|Fellows {{is among}} the {{earliest}} cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties, including treaties between the United States and Native American tribes, as binding law.
