2500|$|The pro-Western Iraqi {{government}} of Faisal II and Nuri al-Said prosecuted the alleged Jewish perpetrators in court, {{in a trial}} which began in October 1951. Two confirmed activists in the Zionist underground, Shalom Salah Shalom, a 19-year-old weapons expert, and Yosef Ibrahim Basri, a lawyer active in collecting intelligence material, were executed after being convicted of the bombings. Whilst their involvement in the underground movement and holdings of weapons caches were not disputed, both denied involvement in the bombings. Salah's testimony under torture indirectly allowed the Iraqi police to find large weapons caches of the Zionist underground in three synagogues (Mas'uda Shemtov, Hakham Haskal and Meir Tuweik) and in private homes, including 436 hand-grenades, 33 machine-guns, 97 machine-gun cartridges, 186 pistols. Shlomo Hillel, also once {{a member of the}} Iraqi Zionist underground, noted that the last words of the executed defendants were [...] "Long live the State of Israel". The British Foreign Office noted in a <b>file</b> <b>note</b> [...] "Trial of Jews at Baghdad, 20 December 1951" [...] that they had “no reason to suppose that the trials were conducted in anything but a normal manner.” ...|$|E

ASIC appeared before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 16 March 2015, where it stated that the Court dealt ith the issue of the misleading <b>file</b> <b>notes.</b> On 19 June 2015, the Supreme Court of Victoria found in the FOS's favour but it did not address the discrepancies in materials. The Court stated in its judgment that it did not examine any issues beyond the actual decision of the FOS itself, thus it did not examine any materials (including the <b>file</b> <b>notes</b> and the recordings), nor did it dealt with any allegations of misconduct. The FOS released a media statement attempting to dismiss the allegations and rely on the ruling by the court. The statement did not address allegations in the submission about misleading <b>file</b> <b>notes</b> presented in the discovery phase of a trial. Following media coverage of this case there were calls by a number of Australian Senators, including Senator Nick Xenophon, for the FOS to be disbanded and replaced with a government funded body.|$|R

5000|$|During the Nazi era, Karl Kimmich {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in the so-called [...] "Arianisation" [...] of Jewish firms carried out by Deutsche Bank. On July 25, 1938, he mentioned in a <b>file</b> <b>note</b> that 260 out of 700 Jewish firms listed by the bank´s headquarters had been Arianized. In the same paper, he moaned that it often lasted two months until all officials had given their OK to the expropriation of a Jewish company. Anyway, by November 1938, - shortly before the Night of Broken Glass - he could report to official ranks that his company had arranged so far 330 [...] "arianisations" [...] that were mostly concluded. He also had close personal bindings to high Nazi officials, as his younger brother Max Wilhelm was brother-in-law to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. However, he was never sentenced for his actions during this time: originally, the Americans had planned to bring to trial {{all members of the}} executive board of Deutsche Bank, but later dismissed this plan because they thought nothing would come out of it. Karl Kimmich died on September 10, 1945 - shortly before his 65th birthday - in Berlin. The reasons of his death - illness or suicide - are quite uncertain.|$|E
