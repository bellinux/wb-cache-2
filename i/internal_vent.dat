40|$|Abstract—A {{dual mode}} digital hearing aid chip with {{real-time}} autonomous gain verifications {{algorithm is proposed}} and implemented. Four proposed gain models due to the different internal sound paths are analyzed to verify its usefulness. By adopting this algorithm, a real-ear aided gain and a real-ear occluded gain which considers <b>internal</b> <b>vent</b> effect and leakage path effect are compared with conventional models. To evaluate this algorithm the implemented chip adopts two different modes; a hearing aid mode and a gain verification mode for a hearing aid operation and internal gain verification, respectively. The minimum and maximum convergence time of the presented algorithm covers 0. 05 s at a 1 kHz input signal and 1. 6 s at a 7. 5 kHz input signal, respectively. The implemented chip dissipates less than 130 µW at a supply voltage of 0. 9 V and occupies a 5. 4 mm 2 core are at a 0. 18 µm CMOS technology. I...|$|E

40|$|Sufficient heat {{dissipation}} {{is crucial to}} the effective operation of friction based braking systems. Such cooling is generally provided by ensuring a sufficient supply of cooling air to the heated components, hence the aerodynamics in the region of the brake components is extremely important. The objective of the research was to develop an understanding of how aerodynamics could be used to improve the cooling of automotive disc brakes. Two separate sets of wind tunnel experiments were developed. Tests were performed on a vented disc (rotor) to measure the internal flow through the vents on a rotating vented disc under various conditions, including an isolated disc in still air, the disc in still air with the wheel on, the disc in moving air with the wheel on, and an on-road simulation using a &frac 14; car. On vehicle tests were also performed in a wind tunnel using a purpose built brake test rig. These tests measured the thermal performance of different brake discs under various operating parameters; including constant load braking, and cooling from high temperature under various speeds, wheels and disc types. It was found that airflow through vented rotors was significantly reduced during simulated on-road driving, compared to when measured in isolation, but not particularly affected by the vehicles speed. In the situations tested, vented discs offered a 40 +% improvement in cooling over an equivalent sized solid rotors. However the research indicates that the greatest benefit of vented rotors over solid will be in vehicles where air entering the wheel cavity is limited, such as low drag vehicles. It was also found that the most significant improvements in brake thermal performance could be achieved by maximising the airflow into the region of the brake components; including increasing the open area of the wheel, and increasing the vehicle velocity. Other improvements can be achieved by using a wheel material with good conductive capability, and increasing the mass of the disc. Evidence of vortex shedding was also discovered in the airflow at the exit of an <b>internal</b> <b>vented</b> rotor, any reduction in this flow disturbance should lead to increased airflow with associated improvements in thermal performance...|$|R

40|$|Current {{autonomous}} parafoil and payload {{aircraft are}} controlled by deflection of the canopy trailing edge. Asymmetric trailing edge deflection results in a turn, symmetric deflection results in a change in speed with little change in glide slope.

This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. 1. 2 Determinations of Compliance and Violation Determinations of certain modes of compliance with and violation of certification specifications is outlined in § 9. 1. 3 Modifications Modification of this procedure may be necessary for vapors and fluids other than the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. Any modification of this method shall be subject to approval by the ARB Executive Officer. 2 PRINCIPLE AND SUMMARY OF TEST PROCEDURE Upon completion of loading operations at the bulk gasoline distribution facility, the gasoline cargo tank is pressurized, with nitrogen, to 18 inches water column.

Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry.

A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|R

In space applications, the low thrust nozzles are used as a propulsion device to control the vehicle attitude, or to maneuver the vehicle flight trajectory. When the spacecraft is deployed in the orbit or cruising in a planetary mission, the vacuum plume is created behind the nozzle exit (so called backflow region), by the exhausting gas of the propulsion system or by <b>venting</b> <b>internal</b> gas to the extremely low density ambient. The low density vacuum plume flow regions cover the continuum, transitional and free molecular flow regimes, which were characterized by the Knudsen number K(sub n), K(sub n) = lambda(sub m) /L where lambda(sub m) is the mean free path of the gas molecules and L is the characteristic length of the flow field. The transitional regime is defined by 0. 01 is {{less than or equal to}} K(sub n) is less than or equal to 10.

40|$|Utilizing {{geometry}} based static {{phase separation}} {{exhibited in the}} radial vaned capillary drying tray, a system was conceived to recover water from brine. This technology has been named the Capillary BRIC; abbreviated CapiBRIC. The CapiBRIC utilizes a capillary drying tray within a drying chamber. Water is recovered from clean water vapor evaporating from the free surface leaving waste brine solids behind. A novel approach of optimizing the containment geometry to support passive capillary flow and static phase separation provides {{the opportunity for a}} low power system that is not as susceptible to fouling as membranes or other technologies employing physical barriers across the free brine surface to achieve phase separation in microgravity. Having been optimized for operation in microgravity, full-scale testing of the CapiBRIC as designed cannot be performed on the ground as the force of gravity would dominate over the capillary forces. However, subscale units relevant to full-scale design were used to characterize fill rates, containment stability, and interaction with a variable volume reservoir in the PSU Dryden Drop Tower (DDT) facility. PSU also using tested units scaled such that capillary forces dominated in a 1 -g environment to characterize evaporation from a free-surface in 1 -g upward, sideways and downward orientations.

Nas raízes intactas praticamente houve apenas absorção de água através das paredes e membranas celulares. Nos segmentos a infiltração de água através dos volumes intercelulares foi dominante.

The observed pressure reduction was smaller than the one observed in the constant pressure manometry procedure where the roots were sealed with epoxy resin, which precluded any water infiltration and changes of root volume. Partially submerged intact roots and segments were less subject to intercellular water infiltration than the completely submerged ones.

40|$|Background Extreme environments {{prompt the}} {{evolution}} of characteristic adaptations. Yet questions remain about whether radiations in extreme environments originate from a single lineage that masters a key adaptive pathway, or if the same features can arise in parallel through convergence. Species endemic to deep-sea hydrothermal vents must accommodate high temperature and low pH. The most successful vent species share a constrained pathway to successful energy exploitation: hosting symbionts. The vent-endemic gastropod genus Gigantopelta, from the Southern and Indian Oceans, shares unusual features with a co-occurring peltospirid, the ‘scaly-foot gastropod’ Chrysomallon squamiferum. Both are unusually large for the clade and share other adaptive features such as a prominent enlarged trophosome-like oesophageal gland, not found in any other vent molluscs. Results Transmission electron microscopy confirmed endosymbiont bacteria in the oesophageal gland of Gigantopelta, as also seen in Chrysomallon. They are the only known members of their phylum in <b>vent</b> ecosystems hosting <b>internal</b> endosymbionts; other <b>vent</b> molluscs host endosymbionts in or on their gills, or in the mantle cavity. A five-gene phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated that Gigantopelta and Chrysomallon are not phylogenetically sister-taxa, despite their superficial similarity. Both genera have specialist adaptations to accommodate internalised endosymbionts, but with anatomical differences that indicate separate evolutionary origins. Hosting endosymbionts in an internal organ within the host means that all resources required by the bacteria must be supplied by the animal, rather than directly by the vent fluid. Unlike Chrysomallon, which has an enlarged oesophageal gland throughout post-settlement life, the oesophageal gland in Gigantopelta is proportionally much smaller in juveniles and the animals likely undergo a trophic shift during ontogeny. The circulatory system is hypertrophied in both but the overall size is smaller in Gigantopelta. In contrast with Chrysomallon, Gigantopelta possesses true ganglia and is gonochoristic. Conclusions Key anatomical differences between Gigantopelta and Chrysomallon demonstrate these two genera acquired a similar way of life through independent and convergent adaptive pathways. What {{appear to be the}} holobiont’s adaptations to an extreme environment, are driven by optimising bacteria’s access to vent nutrients. By comparing Gigantopelta and Chrysomallon, we show that metazoans are capable of rapidly and repeatedly evolving equivalent anatomical adaptations and close-knit relationships with chemoautotrophic bacteria, achieving the same end-product through parallel evolutionary trajectories. ...|$|R
