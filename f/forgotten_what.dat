5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its text for improvement of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E

The rev. gentleman’s name appears in the roll of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament for 1872, so that here we get another peep into the interior economy of those notorious “Woodard Schools”, of which Lancing College is the headquarters.|$|E

The tails are long and curved over the back while the ears and muzzle may be pointed, square or rounded. The legs are short and in one case from Hatiheu Valley the paws were pointed in the wrong direction...The early post-contact dog is white or spotted, small to medium size, with pointed snout and ears, and a long tail. Could the Marquesans of the past have <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> the dog looked like or did it matter they {{depicted}} the dog? ...|$|E

We have not <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952: [...] "Don't forget that the first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen-SS, that the one beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks. They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. Remember these martyrs".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. There is a statue portraying The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder outside the courthouse in the episode. Oakley {{said that this was}} a mistake because he and Weinstein thought that Springfield was located in Swartzwelder County, incorrectly going off a montage in the season three episode [...] "Dog of Death". That montage depicts Springfield as being located in Springfield County; Swartzwelder is the adjoining county. The appearance of the female Child Protective Services agent is based on a teacher both Oakley and Weinstein had in high school that they hated. Cast member Hank Azaria's voice for the character Cletus was slightly distorted in this episode because, over the summer between seasons, Azaria and the producers had <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> Cletus sounds like.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just shot}} a Beyoncé video at the {{beginning}} of this last week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, which was fun, and I hadn't done a video since 2009. It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, [...] "If We Are the Body" [...] was {{originally}} written {{for use as}} a [...] "teaching tool" [...] in his youth group. Hall, a youth pastor, said that [...] " [...] <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> the body of Christ looked like" [...] and commented that [...] "The world is well aware of what the church is against, but they aren’t always aware of what it’s for. Everybody in the body of Christ is given gifts to minister with; and when Christians aren’t using these gifts, the body suffers". Hall's inspiration for writing the song came from the second chapter of the book of James, where the writer [...] "admonishes" [...] readers to [...] "steer clear of giving preferential treatment to any one particular group over another, such as favoring the rich over the poor".|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> comes next in the current quest or storyline.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> {{it felt like to}} have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles {{to the back of the}} boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, {{including}} Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E

2500|$|Initially Davies and {{director}} Giacomo Campiotti clashed {{about how to}} present the material. Davies recalled, [...] "The first couple of weeks after Giacomo joined this project were horrendous for me because Zhivago {{has always been one}} of his very favorite books. He has always dreamed about filming it and has his own interpretation in his head. I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about a single thing, that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> we were arguing about now, as now we are both very pleased with the script. I always knew that he would make it look beautiful because he has got a poet's vision and now, having seen the rushes and some cut footage, I feel like he is my favourite director of all time. Everything is delightful now... Giacomo Campiotti's direction makes it extraordinary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E

2500|$|Puyi had a {{standard}} Confucian education, being taught the various Confucian classics and nothing else. Puyi later wrote: [...] "I learnt nothing of mathematics, let alone science, {{and for a}} long time I had no idea where Beijing was situated". When Puyi was 13, he met his parents and siblings, all of whom had to kowtow before him as he sat upon the Dragon Throne. By this time, Puyi had <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> his mother looked like. Such was the awe that the Emperor was held that his younger brothr Pujie never heard his parents refer Puyi as [...] "your elder brother", who was always just the Emperor. Pujie told Behr his image of Puyi prior to meeting him was that of [...] "...a venerable old man with a beard. I couldn't believe it when I saw this boy in yellow robes sitting solemnly on the throne". It was decided that Pujie would join Puyi in the Forbidden City to provide him with a playmate, though Puyi was notably angry when he discovered his brother was wearing yellow [...] the color of the Qing [...] as he believed that only Emperors had the right to wear yellow, and it had to be explained to him that all members of the Qing family could wear yellow.|$|E
2500|$|At Triplemanía XIX, Nicho el Millonario {{interfered}} in a six-man tag team match, {{where his}} tag team partner Joe Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal faced Los Maniacos and was, as a result, suspended {{for three months}} by AAA following the event in accordance to a deal made between Konnan and Joaquín Roldán. Prior {{to the start of}} his suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that he had been there for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he would have to find work from another promotion. Nicho returned to AAA on July 16, threatening Roldan, which led to Joe Líder trying to calm his partner down. This in turn led to Nicho declaring that if Líder was with Roldan, they were no longer friends. Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. After another attack at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder for the third time on August 19, before putting on a Perros del Mal shirt, which led to El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, making his first AAA appearance in two months, officially welcoming him to the group. On September 16, Konnan rewarded Chessman by moving him back to La Legión Extrangera and naming him the group's new general, taking over the spot formerly held by El Zorro. In the process, Decnnis was also moved from La Milicia to Los Maniacos. Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario were defeated in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match and were all shaved bald. At the same event, Abyss and Chessman defeated Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to bring the AAA World Tag Team Championship back to La Sociedad, while El Hijo del Perro Aguayo failed to capture the AAA Latin American Championship from Dr. Wagner Jr. After the match between Wagner and Aguayo, Octagón shocked AAA by turning on the promotion and attacking Wagner. La Parka then entered the ring to seemingly confront his longtime partner, before also turning on Wagner and attacking him along with Octagón, Aguayo, Konan Big and Silver King. On November 5, Konnan named Octagón the new leader of La Milicia, replacing Super Fly. Octagón then showed that he had not <b>forgotten</b> <b>what</b> Super Fly had done to him fourteen months earlier by ordering {{the rest of the group}} to attack him, kicking him out of La Milicia. At the November 14 tapings, Héctor Garza jumped from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to AAA, aligning himself with Los Perros del Mal. On December 16 at Guerra de Titanes, L.A. Park defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship. Following the match, a new group named El Consejo ("The Council"), consisting of former CMLL workers El Texano Jr., Toscano and Máscara Año 2000 Jr., made its debut, declaring war on both AAA and La Sociedad. On March 11, 2012, La Sociedads title domination ended, when Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Psycho Circus. The following day, the three announced that they had quit Los Perros del Mal. On March 18 at Rey de Reyes, the short-lived alliance between La Sociedad and La Parka came to an end, when Octagón and La Milicia turned on him, after he had lost his rivalry against Los Bizarros. Rey de Reyes also continued the rivalry between La Sociedad stablemates, Jeff Jarrett and L.A. Park. After Jarrett's interference caused Park to get eliminated from the Rey de Reyes tournament, Park came back during the main event and cost Jarrett the AAA Mega Championship in his match against El Mesías. On August 5 at Triplemanía XX, Jarrett and the debuting Kurt Angle represented Dorian Roldán in a match, where they faced Park and Electroshock, representing Joaquín Roldán, with the Roldáns' hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, but Joaquín announced that he did not want his son shaved after he had agreed to disband La Sociedad. However, Dorian ended up once again betraying his father by attaking him and shaving him instead. The event also featured Psicosis defeating longtime rival Joe Líder in another Hair vs. Hair match and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo unsuccessfully challenging El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The following November, El Consejo joined La Sociedad. On December 2 at Guerra de Titanes, El Consejo member El Texano Jr. defeated El Mesías to bring the AAA Mega Championship back to La Sociedad.|$|E
