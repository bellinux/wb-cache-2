5|$|Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers {{continue}} to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls.

5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USA.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality {{is linked to the}} domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially {{increased the number}} of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975. Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 were caught in the North Atlantic. Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century. Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s. After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Gotō Islands.|$|E
