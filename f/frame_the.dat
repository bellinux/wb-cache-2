40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how different fractions of Swedenâ€™s left wing (the Social democrats, the Communists, the Syndicalists and <b>the</b> Socialist party) <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> end of the Spanish Civil War and the defeat of the republicans. To answer the purpose four newspapers Arbetaren (syndicalist), Folkets Dagblad (Socialist party), Ny Dag (communist) and Socialdemokraten (social democratic) have been analyzed qualitatively. The thesis has focused on how the different ideologies have <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> war, how they <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> other labour organizations and themselves plus how they relate to information about the war during the period of February 1 st 1939 till April 5 th 1939. The analysis shows that the Social democrats and <b>the</b> Communists <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> war as a conflict between fascism and socialism, whereas the Syndicalists and <b>the</b> Socialist party <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> war as a socialistic revolution. Because each side had their own view, their opinions on what threatened a republican victory differed. The Social democrats were most concerned that a non-democratic movement would win the war and the Communists feared that fragmentation within the republicans would threaten their chances to win. In contrast, the Syndicalists argued that the nonintervention policy would make the revolution impossible and <b>the</b> Socialist party <b>framed</b> <b>the</b> threat as the Communists, because of their non-revolutionary agenda...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a number of finite-element analyses carried out to support the development of an analytical design procedure for fuselage frames of a transport aircraft. The numerical simulation by means of finite-element method has the aim of developing an adequate sensitivity about the advantages and the limitations of the analytical approach and in quantifying the magnitude of such limitations with respect to more refined design tools. In particular, the final objective is to achieve a deeper insight into some of the design aspects of <b>the</b> <b>frames,</b> such as <b>the</b> influence of realistic load cases and the effects of <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> on <b>the</b> behaviour of the structure in their vicinity. The results indicate that the analytical design method is capable of describing correctly the influence of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> on <b>the</b> stress state of the structure at a sufficient distance from <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> location, in <b>the</b> simplifying hypothesis of negligible effects of adjacent loaded <b>frames.</b> In <b>the</b> immediate surroundings of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and within <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> itself, <b>the</b> analytical method can provide a first approximation of the stress fields...|$|R

These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the Aachen art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought {{to have come from}} Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E

5|$|As {{mandated}} by the Olympic Charter, various elements <b>frame</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975â€“1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
