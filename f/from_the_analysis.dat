If two species excluded {{in the former}} study are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis,</b> the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus Narcissus. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His {{mother gave}} them a Ford Model A {{and the use of}} the family's lakeside holiday house, where they entertained guests {{including}} Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Analysis</b> of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.|$|E

5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always {{just a fraction of}} the A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E
5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than the one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were found to be more distantly so.|$|E
5|$|Models are {{initialized}} {{using this}} observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are initialized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|E

25|$|Trimmed {{sequences}} {{from the}} previous step are aligned to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) and the unmapped reads are removed. The aligned reads that have the same 24 bp tag sequence and genomic region are detected and grouped together (Family αβ and βα in the figure 2). Each group represents a “tag family”. Tag families with lower than three members are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis.</b> To remove errors arise during PCR amplification or sequencing, mutations that are supported by less than 70% of the members (reads) are filtered out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis.</b> Then a consensus sequence is generated for each family using the identical sequences in each position of the remaining reads. The consensus sequence is called single strand consensus sequence (SSCS). The SSCS method increases the NGS accuracy to about 20 fold higher, however this method relies on the sequencing information from single strands of DNA and therefore is sensitive to the errors induced at the first round or before PCR amplification.|$|E

25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI.

Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, it is entirely possible that the ion suppressing species may be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E
