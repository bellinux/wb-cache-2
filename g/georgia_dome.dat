5|$|After {{a loss to}} the New Orleans Saints on November 26, 2006 in the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> Vick made {{an obscene}} gesture at fans in an {{apparent}} reaction to booing, holding up both hands with the middle finger extended. He was fined $10,000 by the NFL and agreed to donate another $10,000 to charity.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons are {{a natural}} {{geographic}} rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only 230 miles (370 kilometers) south on I-85. The two teams have played each other {{twice a year}} since the Panthers' inception, and games between the two teams feature large contingents of Panthers fans at Atlanta's <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the NCAA Tournament UConn easily {{advanced}} to the Final Four at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta. UConn rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat Texas in the semifinals and, aided by Taurasi's 28 points in the finals, defeated rival Tennessee for UConn's fourth national championship. UConn became {{the first team to}} win a championship without a senior on their roster.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} championship rounds {{were held at}} the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta, Georgia.

5|$|Alabama {{also played}} five non-conference games. For the season opener, the Tide {{played in the}} Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game against Virginia Tech at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta. The non-conference {{schedule}} also included games against Florida International and North Texas of the Sun Belt Conference and UT-Chattanooga of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). For the 2010 BCS National Championship Game, Alabama played Texas {{for the first time}} since the 1982 Cotton Bowl Classic.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference {{championship}} games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} Virginia Tech Hokies and the Tennessee Volunteers on December 31, 2009, in the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> Atlanta, Georgia.

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies (10-3), led by redshirt {{freshman}} running back Ryan Williams and Junior Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, met in Atlanta with the Tennessee Volunteers (7-6) at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> {{to end their}} season right where it had begun against Alabama, who would win the National Championship a week later. Williams, who had only moved to number 1 on the depth charts when Darren Evans was injured in the offseason, was looking for 109 yards rushing to pass Kevin Jones’ school-record of 1,647 set in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In Albrecht's {{role with}} the 2012–13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 {{points in a}} game before the NCAA Tournament. In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led by less than 10 {{the rest of the}} game. Several players had career-highs in the game, including Albrecht who had 7 points and 3 steals. The national championship rounds were held at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta, Georgia. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Michigan emerged with its thirty-first victory, the most since the 1992–93 team went 31–5.

The teams then traded a series of punts before T. J. Yeldon extended the Alabama lead to 14–0 with his two-yard touchdown run that capped a 49-yard drive.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies went 10-4 in 2008, {{concluding}} {{the season}} with a 20-7 win in the 2009 Orange Bowl. Before the 2009 season started, Virginia Tech accepted an invitation to play Alabama in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, a game organized by the Chick-fil-A Bowl to pit two high-profile teams against each other to create a bowl game-like atmosphere in the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> {{at the start of the}} season. Virginia Tech was ranked No. 7 in the preseason polls, while Alabama was No. 5; the game was forecast as a competition between two possible national championship contenders. Alabama defeated Virginia Tech 34-24 and ultimately went on to win the national championship.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a run after the catch (the first catch going for 38yards and the second going for 47yards, both over the middle) displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange {{for the right to}} pick the first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million. The combined $5.65million payout was the seventh-largest among all {{college football}} bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game payout.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but that figure {{was based on}} the number of tickets sold rather than actual turnstile attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia {{for the final}} phase. Wenham and his team {{transformed}} a defunct train yard into an abandoned auto plant used by the protagonists as their headquarters. Redesigning the train yard took place over several months. It was required to allow enough space for stunt drivers to drive into the building, {{and it had to}} include an integrated lighting system. The design team removed walls, hauled out old railway cars, suspended rusted car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in the rafters of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set. An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> The train heist scene was filmed in Rice, California over three weeks.|$|E

25|$|A severe storm ripped {{a hole in}} the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> {{wreaking havoc}} on the SEC tournament. After game delays and a venue change, the Georgia Bulldogs scored an {{unlikely}} championship run that included winning two games in one day.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 Holyfield {{had only}} one fight, making a {{mandatory}} defense against Vaughn Bean, who was defeated by decision at the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in the champion's hometown. For the first time, Holyfield's performance called into question whether age was diminishing his ability to continue as a championship fighter.|$|E
25|$|On {{an ironic}} note, after tornadoes forced the 2008 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament {{to be moved}} from the <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> to Georgia Tech's home court Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now known as Hank McCamish Pavilion), the Bulldogs pulled off an {{unlikely}} stretch of three wins in thirty hours to win the tournament on their bitter rivals' home court.|$|E
