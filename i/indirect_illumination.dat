The technique {{is useful for}} applying indirect light to participating media, glossy specular reflection, and <b>indirect</b> diffuse <b>illumination,</b> but this thesis focuses on the <b>indirect</b> diffuse <b>illumination.</b> When applying <b>indirect</b> diffuse light, the light propagation volume method has issues with light bleeding, self lighting, and surface lighting artifacts. Also, when the indirect diffuse lighting is applied to more complex geometry, {{there is a lack}} of directional influence in the shading, producing a flat lighting effect, uncharacteristic of diffuse shading. I modify the light propagation volume approach by extending the spherical harmonics from two bands to three bands and describe a higher order propagation approach that considers 26 directions of propagation versus the original six. The new resulting technique is called higher order light propagation volumes. Higher order light propagation volumes are able to combat some of the problems present with light propagation volumes. The new technique reduces the appearance of lighting artifacts, and at the same time promotes a light distribution in scenes that resembles reference implementations, such as path tracing. Lastly, <b>indirect</b> diffuse <b>illumination</b> applied with the new technique produces higher quality diffuse shading detail because the directional representation of light is better preserved with the combination of extended spherical harmonics light representation and the higher order propagation metho...|$|R

By reversing this channel we can speak of the mutual information of a polygon with respect to all viewpoints. From this polygonal information we represent a kind of ambient occlusion, which is dependent on the importance assigned to each viewpoint and helps to enhance features such as salient parts. Further, the assignation of color to each viewpoint combined with the polygonal information produces a nice visualization of the object.

50|$|The {{period of}} daytime from the {{standpoint}} of a surface observer is roughly defined as the period between sunrise, when the Earth's rotation towards the east first causes the Sun's disc to appear above the horizon, to sunset, when the continuing rotation of the Earth causes the Sun's disc to disappear below the horizon to the west. Because the Sun is a luminous disc as seen from the Earth, rather than a point source of light, sunrise and sunset are not instantaneous and the exact definition of both can vary with context. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere further bends and diffuses light from the Sun and lengthens the period of sunrise and sunset. For a certain period after sunset and before sunrise, indirect light from the Sun lightens the sky on Earth; this period {{is often referred to as}} twilight. Certain groups, such as Earthly astronomers, do not consider daytime to be truly ended until the Sun's disc is actually well below the Earth's horizon, because of this <b>indirect</b> <b>illumination.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{infrared}} is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but {{the boundary between}} visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light.

30|$|Although the {{visualization}} of vessels {{with the new}} device {{is based on the}} same physical principal of <b>indirect</b> background <b>illumination</b> applied in all such devices, there are clearly new features with relevance to the development of research in this field. The high-resolution sensor combined with lenses especially made for microcirculatory imaging makes the optical resolution higher than the SDF system. As a result, more capillaries become visible (Figure  2), with substantial implications for the observation of the microcirculation in several disease states. This also has the potential to observe smaller structures such as vessel wall abnormalities and possibly the endothelial glycocalyx. The new quantitative focusing mechanism not only allows more precise focusing but also maintains optimal focusing depth throughout a measurement allowing multiple observations to be made over time without the need to refocus each time a measurement is made. Focus of ongoing research, i.e., measurements for extended periods of time on one and the same spot, is currently not possible, especially in the nonsedated patients. As such, the potential to maintain optimal focusing depth reduces the variability in observations. The potential for development of treatment based on the on-line analysis of the fully digitalized images and increase in frame rate are outside the scope of this article.|$|R
40|$|Global {{illumination}} is {{a general}} term for various methods used in 3 D graphics to simulate light coming directly and indirectly to a surface location. The computational cost of the full-scale global illumination is very high and rendering times for the scenes using global illumination can range from minutes to hours per image. The high computational cost {{has led to the}} development of many approximations. Ambient occlusion is a technique that approximates the <b>indirect</b> global <b>illumination</b> at significantly lower cost. The lower computational cost has made ambient occlusion a popular technique used by movie industry and more recently it has gathered the interest of real-time graphics industry. In this study, five sampling methods that can be used in ray traced ambient occlusion computations are reviewed and compared: random, jittered stratified, Poisson disk, Halton low discrepancy sequence and Hammersley low discrepancy sequence sampling. The results of this study indicate that Hammersley sequence p 1 = 2 is the second slowest but gives the best results in terms of quality. Halton sequence p 1 = 2, p 1 = 7 sampling and jittered stratified sampling perform almost equally in terms of image quality, but the Halton sequence is notably slower of the two. This study also represents a simple Halton sequence based optimization to ray traced ambient occlusion computation. The optimisation gives a notable improvement in the rendering speed and has no adverse effects to the image quality. The results indicate that optimised Halton sequence p 1 = 2, p 1 = 7 gives the second best image quality and is the fastest of the sampling methods tested. The optimisation is very easy to implement and has a low memory cost which makes it an attracting method of speeding up ambient occlusion computations...|$|R
