25|$|At {{the urging}} of Lt. Ralph W. Christie, who headed the Mark 14's design team, {{equatorial}} tests were later conducted by , which fired one hundred trial shots between 10°N and 10°S and collected 7000readings. The tests were done using torpedoes with instrumented exercise heads: an <b>electric</b> <b>eye</b> would take an upward-looking picture from the torpedo; the magnetic influence feature would set off some gun cotton.|$|E
25|$|Photomultipliers {{were the}} first <b>electric</b> <b>eye</b> devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light. Photomultipliers are used in {{conjunction}} with scintillators to detect Ionizing radiation by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and particle radiation in physics experiments. Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots. Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many spectrophotometers. This allows an instrument design that escapes the thermal noise limit on sensitivity, and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument.|$|E

25|$|Commonly {{interlocks}} {{are added}} to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case an interlock could be added {{to insure that the}} oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches and <b>electric</b> <b>eyes</b> are other common elements in control circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Laser range {{or other}} light signal {{frequency}} range finders operate just like radar at much higher frequencies. Non-laser light detection is utilized extensively in automated machine control systems (e.g. <b>electric</b> <b>eyes</b> controlling a garage door, conveyor sorting gates, etc.), {{and those that}} use pulse rate detection and ranging are at heart, {{the same type of}} system as a radar - without the bells and whistles of the human interface.|$|R
500|$|Along with comedian Thea Vidale, Samson {{hosted the}} 2005 AVN Awards, at which she won awards herself for [...] "Best All-Girl Sex Scene – Film" [...] and [...] "Best Group Sex Scene – Film". In February 2005, Samson began co-hosting a daily music-and-talk radio {{show on the}} Internet station <b>Electric</b> <b>Eye</b> Radio. Later in the year, she {{featured}} alongside Jenna Jameson in Vivid's high-budget remake of the classic adult film The Devil in Miss Jones. Samson's role as Miss Jones earned her the 2006 AVN Awards for [...] "Best Actress – Film" [...] and [...] "Best All-Girl Sex Scene – Film". During her acceptance speech, she revealed the importance of support from her peers and said [...] "most of my family is pretty ashamed of what I do".|$|E
2500|$|The Mark 6 exploder, {{designated}} Project G53, {{was developed}} [...] "behind the tightest veil of secrecy the Navy had ever created." [...] Exploders were tested at the Newport lab {{and in a}} small field test aboard [...] [...] At Ralph Christie's urging, equatorial tests were later conducted with , which fired one hundred trial shots between 10°N and 10°S and collected 7000readings. The tests were done using torpedoes with instrumented exercise heads: an <b>electric</b> <b>eye</b> would take an upward-looking picture from the torpedo; the magnetic influence feature would set off some gun cotton. Inexplicably, no live fire trials were ever done with production units. Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt offered the hulk of Cassin-class destroyer Ericsson, but prohibited {{the use of a}} live warhead, and insisted the Bureau of Ordnance (commonly called BuOrd) pay the cost of refloating her if she was hit in error. These were strange restrictions, as Ericsson was due to be scrapped. BuOrd declined. A service manual for the exploder [...] "was written—but, for security reasons, not printed—and locked in a safe." ...|$|E

After the debut release, the band have been touring all over Europe, including appearances at Iceland Airwaves 2013, Eurosonic 2014, South By Southwest 2014 and The Great Escape Festival 2014. They are currently working on their second album.|$|E
50|$|The game {{presents}} an isometric {{point of view}} of different interconnected, maze-like rooms that the player passes through floor by floor. Each room can require brains, brawn or both. All bioweapons present in a room must be killed and all air duct vents that they enter through sealed before proceeding further. The building's paranoid security system has predictably gone haywire, leaving rotating grenade launcher turrets, land mines, electrified floors and laser fences targeting humans. Less hostile puzzle elements are doors, the switches and computers that control them, keycards, infrared <b>electric</b> <b>eyes</b> and teleporters.|$|R
5000|$|One of the association's special promotional {{projects}} which gained brief {{national attention}} {{made its debut}} at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. The [...] "Great Prune Bear", as they called it, was a life-sized bear made entirely of prunes adorned with gleaming teeth and flashing <b>electric</b> <b>eyes,</b> which attracted visitors and photographers from all over. Each was given a folder on {{the advantages of the}} area and asked to estimate the number of fruits used in the bear's creation. As California became an agricultural powerhouse, the valley was transitioning to fruits and vegetables, hence why the much maligned prune was marketed so heavily.|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} smart {{lighting}} {{systems have been}} designed to adjust the lighting condition according to the occupancy in the space, and there are various options for the occupancy sensor, from imaging sensors to non-imaging sensors. For example, in 1987, Rea and Jaekel used video systems, infrared, ultrasonic, and <b>electric</b> <b>eyes</b> to assess energy efficiency in lighting a staff room (6.0 × 8.8 m) [7]. In 1992, an imaging lighting control system called ImCon was proposed, which used a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to monitor the occupancy in a test room (5.6 × 5.6 m) and control four fluorescent fixtures [8]. In 2009, Delaney et al. proposed using a network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors and light sensors to evaluate energy efficiency in lighting systems [9]. In 2010, Agarwal et al. proposed a smart building automation solution using a combination of PIR sensors and magnetic reed switch door sensors [10]. Recently, Aldrich et al. developed a lighting control application using networks of PIR sensors [11]. In 2010, Caicedo et al. looked into {{the problem of how to}} optimize the dimming levels of LED fixtures based on localized occupancy information [12]. A review paper by Guo et al. has comprehensively discussed different sensors that have been used in occupancy-based lighting control systems, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, audible sound sensors, microwave sensors, light barriers, video cameras, biometric systems, and pressure sensors [13]. Another review paper by Hassan et al. also discussed several occupancy detection techniques for lighting control applications, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), and cameras [14].|$|R

Though she appears in Percy's dream {{in the first}} book, she makes a full appearance {{at the end of}} The Sea of Monsters and is given a greater role in the third book. Thalia is described as looking very punk, with <b>electric</b> blue <b>eyes,</b> black clothes, and spiky hair. Her personality is often described as [...] "independent and many times sarcastic." [...] Thalia is a lot like Percy and consequently, they often argue. She is heartbroken by Luke's betrayal, it is supposed that she had feelings for him.

5000|$|Barnacle and Joyce's {{relationship}} was complex. They had different personalities, tastes and cultural interests. Of their first meeting, she recalled: [...] "I mistook {{him for a}} Swedish sailor - His <b>electric</b> blue <b>eyes,</b> yachting cap and plimsolls. But when he spoke, well then, I knew him at once for just another Dublin jackeen chatting up a country girl." [...] The numerous erotic letters they exchanged suggest they loved each other passionately. Joyce seems to have admired and trusted her, and Barnacle clearly loved Joyce and trusted him enough to agree to leave Ireland {{with him for the}} Continent. In anticipation of the move to Paris, she began studying French and Barnacle cooked English puddings at Joyce's request during their travels.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Kiss series" [...] that so {{inspired}} designer Martin Kidman {{was another}} big hit for Athena. Created by Syd Brak, an artist from an advertising background, it was planned specifically {{to appeal to}} teen and pre-teen girls who, Brak says, [...] "aspire to maturity and sophistication". Pictures such as First Kiss, Forget Me Not and Long Distance Kiss all contained some mini- narrative that chimed with the adolescent psyche, hinting picturesquely at the dramas of teenage melancholy, lost love and heartache. The icy, mysterious girls, their faces bleached out, their <b>eyes</b> smothered in <b>electric</b> blue <b>eye</b> shadow and their lips a streak of glossy red, inspired many imitations with cheap make-up. They also apparently inspired last year's homage to the 1980s in The Face which featured on its cover a photograph of airbrush-style perfection. The same photographer, Sølve Sundsbø, followed it up with his recent ad campaign for hip design house Bottega Veneta - the collection, needless to say, inspired by 1980s style.|$|R
500|$|The common torpedo, ocellate torpedo, or <b>eyed</b> <b>{{electric}}</b> ray (Torpedo torpedo) is {{a species}} of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae, found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Biscay to Angola. It is a benthic fish typically encountered over soft substrates in fairly shallow, coastal waters. Growing to [...] long, this species has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a short, thick tail with two dorsal fins of nearly equal size and a large caudal fin. It can be identified by the prominent blue spots on its back, which usually number five but may vary from zero to nine, {{as well as by}} the small knobs on the rims of its spiracles.|$|R
6000|$|In some indefinable {{special way}} the bishop had {{been aware of}} Lady Sunderbund's {{presence}} since first he had met her, {{but it was only}} now that he could observe her with any particularity. She was tall like his own Lady Ella but not calm and quiet; she was <b>electric,</b> her <b>eyes,</b> her smiles, her complexion had as it were an established brightness that exceeded the common lustre of things. This morning she was dressed in grey that was nevertheless not grey but had an effect of colour, and there was a thread of black along the lines of her body and a gleam of gold. She carried her head back with less dignity than pride; there was a little frozen movement in her dark hair as if it flamed up out of her head. There were silver ornaments in her hair. She spoke with a pretty little weakness of the r's that had probably been acquired abroad. And she lost no time in telling him, she was eager to tell him, that she had been waylaying him. [...] "I did so {{want to talk to you}} some maw," [...] she said. [...] "I was shy last night and they we' all so noisy and eaga'. I p'ayed that you might come down early.|$|R
