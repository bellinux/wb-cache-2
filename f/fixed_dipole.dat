The latter method is capable of obtaining dipoles not only at fMRI activation areas but also at areas where fMRI fails to show activation. It means, however, that the nonuniqueness nature of the inverse solutions remains in this method, and that flexibility in finding dipoles and uniqueness of solutions are a tradeoff to be optimized.

The joint design of these elements {{can be used to}} optimize the information throughput of optical imaging systems. This paradigm, termed computational optical imaging, aims at optimizing the output of optical systems in the form of imaging metrics, multidimensional imaging, feature detection, compressive sensing, etc. However, most optical imaging systems rely on the scalar wave theory of light to analyze these modern systems. Light, being an electromagnetic wave is vectorial in nature leading to significant errors in the scalar model when the propagation medium is anisotropic, inhomogeneous or non-linear. Electromagnetic optics, on the other hand, is an all-encompassing theory of light in the classical limit that takes into account the coupled nature of electric and magnetic fields. In this respect, the effects of anisotropic emission from a <b>fixed</b> <b>dipole</b> emitter on high numerical aperture super-resolution microscopy are investigated. Wide field microscope configurations that allow simultaneous acquisition and measurement of the 3 D position and orientation parameters of multiple <b>fixed</b> <b>dipole</b> emitters are proposed. The performance limits of these systems for the 5 D imaging of <b>fixed</b> <b>dipole</b> emitters are quantified through comparison of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds in a photon limited environment. Further, experimental validation is provided for simultaneously estimating the 5 D dipole parameters using the double-helix phase mask. Binary multi-level fabrication of efficient phase modulation elements to engineer the Green 2 ̆ 7 s tensor response of the system to a dipole input is demonstrated. High numerical aperture objectives give rise to steep incident angles on lens surfaces, leading to resolution losses in imaging systems due to aberrations caused by the incorrect assumption of linearity between the incident and refracted angles at material interfaces. A new paradigm, termed infinitely refraction-linear artificial material (IRAM), is proposed to tackle this problem. IRAM maintain the linear relationship between incident and refracted angles beyond the paraxial limit. The inherent anisotropic material parameter requirements for IRAM are summarized. The performance of IRAM lenses is compared to that of conventional isotropic lenses by simulating the diffraction limited spot size of these lenses in Zemax. It is shown that with proper design IRAMs have the potential to improve the resolution of optical imaging systems. Further, another class of artificial metamaterials that use magnetic resonance to realize exotic optical properties is discussed as candidates for super-resolution using the super-lensing effect...|$|E

Current low frequency interferometers use aperture arrays of <b>fixed</b> <b>dipoles,</b> which are steered electronically on the sky, and have different properties to mechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from zenith, and discrete pointing positions on the sky. Use of two additional observing modes is encouraged: (1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre remains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks the sky, and (2) drift+shift, where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky drifts during each pointing. The coherence of measurements in these modes dictates the optimal reduction in thermal noise by combination of coherent modes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination of incoherent modes (views of different patches of the sky). The balance between these noise components provides one measure for the utility of these three modes for measuring a statistical EoR signature.

We investigate a real-time peeling implementation for next-generation radio interferometers such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

The general integral expression for the radiation resistance R is derived, and from that, various approximate closed forms of R are obtained for the entire VLF/ELF range. Numerical plots of R are given for the plasma parameters appropriate to the regions of topside ionosphere and magnetosphere.

This relative maximum R max is ∼ √h/r 0 (h, r 0 being the half-length and radius of the dipole, respectively).

The anisotropy of the magnetic properties is assumed. Thus the effective coefficients of the permeability matrix instead of the single effective value are looked for. The method proposed here consists of two main stages. In the first stage the appropriate representative volume element (RVE) for MR fluid containing formed chains of particles is generated.

In the case of an ordered structure inside the RVE volume the evident anisotropy of magnetic properties is obtained. The value of effective permeability {{in the direction of the}} external magnetic field is approximately two times higher than in the perpendicular direction.

The calculated shunt permeabilities (P) are (in centimeters per hour) P = 0. 040, PN = 0. 035, and Pcl = 0. 019, so that Px:PN:PclI = 1. 14 : 1. 00 : 0. 55. Diffusion potentials across the tissue resulting from isotonic replacement of NaCl in the mucosal solution with mannitol or KC 1 are described by the Goldman constant-field equation together with the above permeabilities of the shunt pathway. These observations are not consistent with permeation through a fixed-charge pore but {{can be explained by}} a model featuring constant ionic partition into a neutral-polar pore that traverses the tight junction. Such a pore may be lined with either <b>fixed</b> <b>dipoles</b> or <b>fixed</b> dipolar ions oriented such that electronegative groups influence the permselective properties of the diffusion pathway. The essential feature of both models is that electroneutrality is maintained by means of fixed membrane components and does not depend upon the presence of mobile counterions. In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the role of transmural, extracellular pathways in the transport of solutes and water by a variety of epithelial tissues. However, the conductance properties of these pathways have not been defined directly because studies of transmural ionic fluxes, diffusion potentials, or streaming potentials do not clearly distinguish between the properties of extracellular and transcellular routes for ion flow...|$|R
5000|$|The Warshel group applied {{statistical}} mechanical computational {{methods and}} empirical valence bond theory to previous experimental data. It {{was determined that}} electrostatic preorganization-including ionic residues and <b>fixed</b> <b>dipoles</b> within the active site-contributes most to KSI catalysis. More specifically, Tyr-14 and Asp-99 dipoles work to stabilize the growing charge which accumulates on the enolate oxygen (O-3) throughout catalysis. In a similar way, the charge on Asp38 is stabilized by surrounding residues and a water molecule {{during the course of}} the reaction. [...] The Boxer group used experimental Stark spectroscopy methods to identify the presence of H-bond-mediated electric fields within the KSI active site. These measurements quantified the electrostatic contribution to KSI catalysis (70%).The active site is lined with hydrophobic residues to accommodate the substrate, but Asp-99 and Tyr-14 are within hydrogen bonding distance of O-3. [...] The hydrogen bonds from Tyr-14 and Asp-99 are known to significantly affect the rate of catalysis in KSI. Mutagenesis of this residue to alanine (D99A) or asparagine (D99N) results in a loss in activity at pH 7 of 3000-fold and 27-fold, respectively, implicating Asp-99 as important for enzymatic activity. Wu et al. proposed a mechanism that involves both Tyr-14 and Asp-99 forming hydrogen bonds directly to O-3 of the steroid. This mechanism was challenged by Zhao et al., who postulated a hydrogen bonding network with Asp-99 hydrogen bonding to Tyr-14, which in turn forms a hydrogen bond to O-3. More recently, the Herschlag group utilized unnatural amino acid incorporation to assay the importance of Tyr-14 to KSI catalysis. [...] The natural tyrosine residue was substituted with unnatural halogenated amino acids surveying a range of pKa's. There was very little difference in KSI catalytic turnover with decreasing pKa, suggesting, in contrast to the electrostatic studies outlined above, that oxyanion hole stabilization is not primarily important for catalysis.|$|R
40|$|Divalent metal nitrates of barium, calcium, lead, and {{strontium}} are isomorphous, crystallizing in the Pa 3 cubic space group, {{and they}} form a continuous set of solid solutions. These cubic crystal systems have ionic sites surrounded by equivalent nearest neighbor ions. The positional coordinates of the cations usually have no degrees of freedom. With such properties, the nitrates are ideal models for calculating the electric field gradient in ionic crystal lattices, and comparing the calculations with results obtained from quadrupole coupling constants measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. The lattice is decomposed in a multipole expansion into point charges, dipole and quadrupole moments. In addition to the point charge, the most significant contributors to the field gradient are generally the induced dipoles, though in crystals with strong <b>fixed</b> <b>dipoles</b> such as water these may dominate. Fixed and induced quadrupoles contribute to a lesser extent. ^ Crystals grown from aqueous solutions containing mixtures of these nitrates incorporate both of the divalent ions into the lattice. Under the right conditions, all of the thirteen possible resonances, ranging from lead ions surrounded by twelve nearest neighbors, {{can be observed in}} a single spectrum. Quantitative analysis of NMR peaks by deconvolution and Monte Carlo simulation shows that solid solutions of PbxSr 1 −x(NO 3) 2 and PbxBa 1 −x(NO 3) 2 tend to cluster slightly, to an extent of the magnitude expected from the van der Waals interaction energies within the crystal. ^ Since the lead atom is very sensitive to its local environment, a correlation between the chemical shift and structure was investigated using NMR powder patterns. An increase in mean Pb-O interatomic distance tends to move the isotropic chemical shifts to low frequency, whereas an increase in Pb-halogen interatomic distance shifts them to high frequency. In addition, complete information about the quadrupolar interactions and the chemical shieldings of the quadrupolar nuclei can be obtained from NMR powder patterns acquired under static and magic angle spinning. ...|$|R
