Watching the various Spanish contingents were the main Danish army on Zealand, 3,000 Danes at Odense on Funen, 800 Danes and a company of French on Langeland, and a <b>Dutch</b> <b>light</b> cavalry brigade and Danish infantry on Jutland. To keep the soldiers quiet, Napoleon increased the officers' pay and promised La Romana the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur. In order to flatter the Spaniards, Bernadotte used a troop of the Rey Regiment as his personal escort.|$|E
500|$|The four {{potential}} {{targets for}} the Eastern Attack Group were Nouméa, Suva, Auckland, and Sydney. Identified by reconnaissance flights conducted by Warrant Flying Officer Nobuo Fujita of the Imperial Japanese Navy flying from I-25; commencing 17 February over Sydney Harbour, and the eastern Australian harbours of Melbourne and Hobart (1 March), followed by the New Zealand harbours of Wellington (8 March) and Auckland (13 March). I-21 and I-29 were sent to select the final target, with I-29 sailing to Sydney. [...] On the evening of 16 May, I-29 fired on the [...] Russian merchant vessel Wellen, [...] from Newcastle, New South Wales. Although Wellen escaped with minimal damage, shipping between Sydney and Newcastle was halted for 24 hours while aircraft and all available anti-submarine ships from Sydney, including <b>Dutch</b> <b>light</b> cruiser HNLMS Tromp, Australian destroyer [...] and US destroyer , searched unsuccessfully for the submarine. Muirhead-Gould concluded that the submarine had operated alone and had left the area immediately after the attack.|$|E

40|$|Agent-based {{consumer}} modelling of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>lighting</b> market This {{document is}} a master's thesis implementing a multi-agent consumer modelling {{system for the}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>lighting</b> market based on the Consumat II psychological model of consumers by Jager and Janssen[1]. The two main questions are (I) how can we implement such a model and (II) how can we facilitate adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the lighting market? The design {{and implementation of the}} multi-agent system will be discussed and several experiments will be run with different variants of the model, showing (1) a homo economicus perspective, (2) a model using only functional behavioural strategies and (3) the full model employing functional and social strategies. A reference study[2] containing relevant market research will be used to provide data for parametrisation and comparison. The developed model proves complex enough to exhibit behaviour as seen in the reference study and provides validation for the conclusions drawn. The most important findings of this thesis are: - Habitual behaviour is the most prominent reason for lack of adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the lighting market. - Social behaviour helps facilitate diffusion of new technologies in the lighting market. - The developed model replicates behaviour as observed in the reference study[2] and can confirm its conclusions.

2500|$|In 1815 Ghigny {{joined the}} Dutch army and was {{promoted}} major general on 21 April. At the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June {{he led the}} 2nd Cavalry Brigade in Jean Antoine de Collaert's Dutch-Belgian Cavalry Division. The brigade {{was made up of}} the 4th (<b>Dutch)</b> <b>Light</b> Dragoon and the 8th (Belgian) Hussar Regiments. After the 1st Brigade of Pierre François Joseph Durutte's French division was broken by British dragoons, Ghigny's brigade advanced downhill from the ridge. Durutte's routed brigade fled behind an infantry square from the VI Corps which Ghigny's horsemen charged without success. British officers branded the Dutch-Belgian cavalry as cowards based on an incident later recalled by Henry Paget, Earl of Uxbridge. In fact, casualties were heavy. At Waterloo, the 4th Light Dragoons lost 54 killed, 143 wounded and 52 missing while the 8th Hussars lost 11 killed, 151 wounded and 122 missing. The 4th Regiment started the day with 647 cavalrymen and the 8th had 439.|$|E

It began by focusing on technology innovations to reduce packaging and increase energy efficiency of its products. This focus shifted over time to consider end-to-end solutions and how the company could influence consumer choices and behaviour. This resulted in a growing portfolio of green product innovations. By the 2000 s the company began setting goals to grow its green product portfolio. In 2007 it set a target that 30 % of its turnover would be from green product revenues by 2012. In 2012 it set a new goal of 55 % of total sales to be 'green' (as of 2013 the proportion stood at 51 %), and embedded the target in the corporate scorecard. About one third of its over $ 2 B annual R&D budget is now directed towards green innovation.
