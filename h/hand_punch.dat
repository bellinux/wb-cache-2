2500|$|On Sunday, February 1, 2015, in Super Bowl XLIX, the Seahawks faced {{off against}} Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, seeking {{to become the}} first team to win two {{consecutive}} Super Bowls since the Patriots themselves won Super Bowl XXXVIII and Super Bowl XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons, respectively. [...] After a scoreless first quarter, both teams scored two touchdowns in the second quarter, and the game was tied 14-14 at halftime. [...] In the third quarter, the Seahawks scored a field goal and a touchdown to take a ten-point lead, which they held going into the fourth quarter. [...] However, Seattle would become the first team in NFL history to blow a 10-point fourth quarter lead in a Super Bowl, as New England would score two touchdowns to take the lead, 28-24 with 2:02 remaining. [...] On what would prove to be their final possession, Seattle managed to drive to New England's 1-yard line and run the clock down to 26 seconds. [...] Then Seattle decided to call a passing play rather than a running play, despite having talented running back Marshawn Lynch on their offense. [...] Unfortunately for Seattle, Wilson's throw was intercepted by New England's rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler, which gave New England possession on their own one-yard line with 20 seconds remaining. [...] This final play by Seattle was almost immediately criticized by many after the game as one of the worst calls in Super Bowl history. [...] However, the game was not quite over for Seattle, as the Patriots could not take a standard quarterback kneeldown without risking giving up a safety, which would give the Seahawks two points and possession of the ball. [...] However, defensive lineman Michael Bennett was flagged for encroachment, which moved the ball out to the 6-yard line. [...] When Brady attempted to take a knee to end the game, linebacker Bruce Irvin threw a closed <b>hand</b> <b>punch</b> at New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, starting a brawl involving players from both teams that resulted in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for Seattle. [...] In addition to the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, Irvin was ejected from the game, making him the first player ever to be ejected from a Super Bowl. [...] After the game, Irvin was fined $10,000. [...] Brady took a kneeldown at the 21-yard line to run {{out the rest of the}} clock and seal Seattle's fate. [...] The Seahawks became the tenth consecutive team to be dethroned of their Super Bowl title, creating a record for the most years without a repeat Super Bowl champion.|$|E

50|$|Before the 18th {{century the}} small dimples {{on the outside}} of a thimble were made by <b>hand</b> <b>punching,</b> but {{in the middle of that}} century, a machine was invented to do the job. If one finds a thimble with an {{irregular}} pattern of dimples, it was likely made before the 1850s. Another consequence of the mechanization of thimble production is that the shape and the thickness of the metal changed.

50|$|The {{first job}} in {{operating}} Colossus {{for a new}} message, was to prepare the paper tape loop.

Using a special <b>hand</b> <b>punch</b> they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels 2½ sprocket holes {{from the end of the}} blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels 1½ sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the “near“ or the “far” tape (this can be seen at the top left of the photograph of the panel).|$|E

5000|$|Many {{regional}} {{variants of}} Pulcinella were developed as the character diffused across Europe. From its {{east to west}} coasts, Europeans heavily identified with the tired, witty [...] "everyman" [...] that Pulcinella represented. Russian composer Igor Stravinsky composed two different ballets entitled Pulcinella and Petrushka, inspired by the character. However, {{in many of these}} adaptations, we saw Pulcinella as a puppet, as commedia dell'arte style theatre was not necessarily popular {{in the rest of the}} continent over time. Most famously, he evolved into Mr. Punch in England. The key half of Punch and Judy, he is recognized as one of the most important British Icons in history. The first recorded show that would have involved this Punch-style marionette was performed in May 1662, outside of London in Covent Garden by Bologna-born puppeteer Pietro Gimonde, also known as Signor Bologna. This marionette was named Punchinello, later evolving into Punch, and finally becoming wholly British with his transformation into Mr. Punch. The British Punch is far more childlike and violent than Pulcinella, but is renowned for being just as funny. Always seen with cudgel in <b>hand,</b> <b>Punch</b> has a more menacing character than his Italian counterpart. In Germany, this kind of Pulcinella-based puppet character came to be known as Kasper. Kasper is a cunning servant who solves the problems of all the masters he serves. This character became a wildly popular throughout Europe, as he was a less extreme version of Mr. Punch, but offered the same kind of slapstick puppetry that audiences loved. In the Netherlands, he is known as Jan Klaassen. In Denmark he is Mester Jakel. In Romania, he is Vasilache. In Hungary he is Vitéz László, and in France he remained Polichinelle.|$|E

50|$|Hamed lost to Barrera via a {{unanimous}} decision (111-116, 112-115, 112-115), losing his Lineal championship. Hamed's record {{at the time}} was 35-0 and he was a heavy favourite with bookmaker's odds of 1/8. Having re injured his hand in training, Hamed took 40 minutes to come to the ring due mostly to not being happy with the gloves and having his hand wraps redone multiple times and didn't vault the rope while entering the ring as he normally did due to the pain in his hand and still not being happy with the gloves. After being wobbled in Round 1, Hamed gained focus and was connecting a lot of punches however as the fight wore on he could not hit Barrera with his trademark lefts as much as in previous bouts as the Mexican boxer was equally quick and was not fighting defensively. His game plan was to circle around Hamed counter-clockwise to negate Hamed's powerful left <b>hand</b> <b>punch.</b> On one occasion early in the fight, Barrera grabbed Hamed around the waist to which Hamed then pulled Barrera and they both fell to the ground where Barrera threw a right jab, leading to a warning from referee Joe Cortez. There were also several unchecked headbutts from Barrera. In the 12th and final round, Hamed, still looking for the knockout punch, missed wildly with a left hand, resulting in Barrera taking the opportunity to trap Hamed in a Half Nelson hold and force his head into the turnbuckle, resulting in a point being deducted by referee Joe Cortez. The flagrant (and memorable) foul, with the corner camera catching an infuriated-looking Barrera ramming Hamed into the corner post with conviction, the slow-motion replay turning it into one of the era's most memorable moments. Ultimately, Barrera was more versatile and threw sharp, effective combinations en route to {{a unanimous}} decision, the first and only loss of The Prince's career.|$|E

Douglas was accompanied by his valet Francine and several [...] "riot squad" [...] officers. Pitbull #2's tag team partner, Pitbull #1, was shown {{sitting in the front}} row for the match because, according to the storyline, doctors had not medically cleared him to be ringside. Pitbull #2 rushed to the ring and immediately began attacking Douglas. Pitbull #2 controlled the early portion of the match with a series of takedowns and headlocks. Douglas then gained control after he countered a powerbomb with a headscissors takedown which brought both wrestlers over the top rope to the outside of the ring. Douglas tossed Pitbull #2 back into the ring and performed three consecutive piledrivers. Later, both wrestlers ended up outside the ring and Pitbull #1 jumped over the audience guardrail and attacked Douglas, but was soon stopped and escorted to the locker room by the riot squad officers. After Douglas and Pitbull #2 exchanged control of the match for the next several minutes, Francine handed Douglas a pair of brass knuckles, which he then used twice on Pitbull #2. Douglas then hit Pitbull #2 over the head with a portion of a broken table, as well as the timekeeper's ring bell. Douglas attempted multiple pins during the series of attacks but Pitbull #2 kicked-out. After attempted outside interference from Chris Candido, Douglas performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Pitbull #2 and pinned him for the victory to retain the ECW Television Championship. As previously stipulated, the masked man, wearing a [...] "Ravishing" [...] Rick Rude robe, came to the ring to unmask. The man planted a kiss on Francine, and performed Rude's signature gyrations before Douglas hit him in the back with his championship belt. While getting back to his feet, the masked man revealed himself to be Brian Lee, as one of the riot squad officers entered the ring and removed his helmet, revealing himself to be Rick Rude. A surprised Douglas attempted to plead with Rude but to no avail as Rude nailed him with a right <b>hand</b> <b>punch</b> followed by a chokeslam from Lee.|$|E
