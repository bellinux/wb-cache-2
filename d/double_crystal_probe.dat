The results obtained are in satisfactory agreement with the previous observations of Compton line breadth by DuMond and Kirkpatrick with the multicrystal spectrograph and in disagreement with the experimenters who used <b>double</b> <b>crystal</b> spectrometers.

Between March 2008 and March 2010, 50 patients with prostate cancer were consecutively included in the study. The first 25 of these patients had both their pre- and online-planning based on a single sagittal <b>crystal</b> <b>probe</b> (SSCP).

TRUS online and CT post-plan dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, D(90) and V(100), were compared for both groups. Also, the post-plan DVH parameters of SSCP were compared to DSCP. The possible factors that might influence the post-plan D(90) and V(100) were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). SSCP and DSCP online mean D(90) and V(100) were significantly larger than post-plan mean D(90) and V(100) (P < 0. 01).

Radioguided surgery implies {{the use of a}} gamma-probe to count the emitted radioactivity of marked ASLNs. Several gamma-probes are commercially available, each with its own properties.

Two hundred patients with early breast cancer were prospectively enrolled to undergo ASLN radiodetection and axillary lymphadenectomy. ASLN mapping consisted of injecting (99 m) Tc-sulfur-colloid around the tumor. For each patient, sentinel lymph nodes were counted successively with the 3 probes and the sensitivity of each gamma-probe was determined from ASLN residual activity. The results of detection rates and false-negative rates for each probe were compared. RESULTS: Mean residual ASLN activity was 52 kBq (range, 0. 07 - 189 kBq). Sensitivity was compared among the 3 probes and found to be best for probe A. The detection rate of probe A was significantly better than that of probe B (93 % vs. 86 %, P = 0. 05) but not different from that of probe C (93 % vs. 90 %). No differences in false-negative rates were observed among the 3 probes. CONCLUSION: ASLN detection rate depends on the type of gamma-probe used. Because failure to detect the ASLN leads to complete axillary lymphadenectomy, involving local morbidity and other sequelae, the type of gamma-probe must be considered important for sentinel lymph node radiodetectio...|$|R
