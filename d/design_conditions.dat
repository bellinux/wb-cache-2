25|$|Axial {{compressors}} {{can have}} high efficiencies; around 90% polytropic at their <b>design</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, {{they are relatively}} expensive, requiring {{a large number of}} components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.|$|E
25|$|Axial compressors, {{particularly}} near <b>design</b> <b>conditions</b> are, on the whole, {{amenable to}} analytical treatment, and usually a good estimate {{of their performance}} can be made before they are run.

30|$|Finally, the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> {{required}} for the drive wheel to climb the step was analyzed. As previously described, for the drive wheel to climb over the step, the wheelchair has to first perform a wheelie motion, for which the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> has already been obtained. Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, the drive wheel can also climb the step.|$|R

The <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> is represented {{in terms of an}} SOS that can be numerically solved via the SOSTOOLS.

25|$|Even if a lens is {{designed}} to minimize or eliminate the aberrations described above, the image quality is still limited by the diffraction of light passing through the lens' finite aperture.

25|$|If the {{wet method}} is used, the {{extractant}} is dissolved in an additional solvent prior to impregnation. The porous particles are then dispersed in the extractant-solvent solution. After soaking the particles, the excess solvent {{can either be}} filtered off or evaporated. In the first case, an extractant-solvent mixture would be retained within the pores. This would be of interest for extractants which would be solid at <b>design</b> <b>conditions</b> when pure. In the second case, only the extractant would remain inside the pores. Figure 3 shows porous particles dispersed in an aqueous solution after wet impregnation. The cut-out in Figure 3 shows an enlarge segment of the surface of such an impregnated particle.|$|E
25|$|The airfoil {{profiles}} are optimized and matched {{for specific}} velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this {{can result in}} an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit {{on the number of}} stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the <b>design</b> <b>conditions.</b> These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).|$|E
40|$|The {{induced drag}} penalty {{associated}} with off-design flight conditions is investigated. The investigation {{is limited to}} off-design flight conditions at a lower lift coefficient than the design lift coefficient. Two types of total angle of incidence distribution obtained at the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> are studied. One is the distribution for elliptic spanloads {{and the other is}} the spanload distribution for straight-line wrapped surfaces. It is shown that the penalty may be significant as the structural deformation changes the total angle of incidence distribution and the spanload. The penalty is higher for the wing with the near optimal elliptic spanload at the <b>design</b> flight <b>condition.</b> The wing with straight-line wrapped surfaces does not have the minimum induced drag at the <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> However, it is found to be insensitive to the structural deformation...|$|R

In the case ϕ = 61 °, the F_z {{increases}} rapidly when the insertion length: l reaches 5  mm. This is because the jamming is occurred and the mating process results in failure. On the other hand, in the case ϕ = 85 and 120 ° the insertion length exceeds 10  mm, which is the height of the ring, and it can be confirmed that the mating and insertion process succeeded.|$|R
25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at <b>design</b> <b>conditions</b> with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the flow structures emanating from convergent-divergent nozzles with conical sections like {{those used in}} practical high-speed propulsion applications. LES simulations and experimental measurements {{in the form of}} PIV and shadowgraph imaging and far-field acoustic measurement are employed. The development of the supersonic jets from these nozzles are examined in underexpanded, perfectly expanded and overexpanded conditions. It is found that in addition to the shock diamond features expected of smoothly contoured nozzles at off-design conditions, these nozzles produce a second set of shock diamonds anchored at the nozzle throat and overlaid on the shock diamonds shed from the nozzle lip. These together form a double-diamond appearance. These nozzles do not exhibit any shock-free condition at or near the expected <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> As a consequence, there is no absence of shock noise at or near the <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> Near the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> there is a diminution in the intensity of the screech tone, but no diminution in the broad-band shock-associated noise.

The measurements inside the rotor tip region are acquired using a miniature hot wire sensor of 'V' configuration. The instantaneous velocity data is analyzed by the ensemble averaging technique to derive the blade-to-blade velocity field at various axial and radial locations between the rotor tip and the casing. The flow and the blade pressure data at the <b>design</b> <b>condition</b> are compared with the data at the off-design condition (lower blade loading).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer on a compressor rotor blade at peak pressure rise coefficient is reported in this paper. The measurements were carried out at various chordwise and radial locations on a compressor rotor blade using a rotating miniature 'V' configuration hot-wire probe. The data are compared with the measurement at the <b>design</b> <b>condition.</b> Substantial changes in the blade boundary layer characteristics are observed, especially in the outer sixteen percent of the blade span. The increased chordwise pressure gradient and the leakage flow at the peak pressure coefficient have a cumulative effect in increasing the boundary layer growth on the suction surface. The leakage flow has a beneficial effect on the pressure surface.
