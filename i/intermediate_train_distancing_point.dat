5000|$|In 1994, {{the first}} U.S. Air Force {{instructors}} and student navigators (NAVs) reported to Training Squadron TEN under a joint {{memorandum of agreement}} between the services. The agreement included the 1996 transition from the T-39N to the Air Force T-1A “Jayhawk" [...] as the training platform for the Intermediate syllabus events. In April 1996, VT-10 split instructor and student assets {{to assist in the}} establishment of Training Squadron FOUR (VT-4) as a second NFO/NAV Primary/Intermediate Training Squadron. In 1999 the T-39G/N was re-integrated into the NFO <b>intermediate</b> <b>training</b> syllabus as the training platform for Navy and International Students with the T-1 remaining as the training platform for Air Force and Marine Corps Students. In April 2004 VT-10 flew its last T-39G/N sortie with the T-1 taking over as the primary training platform for all VT-10 student NFO <b>intermediate</b> <b>training</b> syllabus flights. In October 2010, the T-39G/N replaced the T-1 in the NFO intermediate syllabus.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the impact of weekly {{swimming}} <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> upon the ergogenicity of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Thirty-three youth swimmers were recruited and separated into a LOW and HIGH group based on weekly <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> (41 km. wk- 1, respectively). The LOW and HIGH groups were further subdivided into control and IMT groups for a 6 -week IMT intervention giving a total of four groups: LOWcon, LOWIMT, HIGHcon, HIGHIMT. Before and after the intervention period, swimmers completed maximal effort 100 m and 200 m front crawl swims, with maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures (PImax and PEmax, respectively) assessed before and after each swim. IMT increased PImax (but not PEmax) by 36 % in LOWIMT and HIGHIMT groups (P < 0. 05) but 100 m and 200 m swims were faster only in the LOWIMT group (3 % and 7 % respectively, P < 0. 05). Performance benefits only occurred in those training up to 31 km. wk- 1 and indicate that the ergogenicity of IMT is affected by weekly <b>training</b> <b>distance.</b> Consequently, <b>training</b> <b>distances</b> are important considerations, among others, when deciding whether or not to supplement swimming training with IMT...|$|R

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} if {{the characteristics}} and training profiles of runners are significant indicators to predict a {{successful completion of}} a marathon. Methods. Experimental design: comparative investigation between two groups of runners at a marathon race. Setting: participants of the study came from the 1998 Standard Chartered New Airport International Marathon in Hong Kong. Participants: 113 runners were investigated, of which 58 runners dropped out at the first 10 km of the race, while the other 55 were those that consulted for physiothearpy service after the marathon. Measures: using questionnaire, the characteristics and the training profiles of these runners were obtained. These included weekly <b>training</b> <b>distance,</b> longest and shortest <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> per session in one week; warm-up and stretching exercise with the training sessions, number of marathons previously finished and the runners' opinion of optimal training mileage to complete a marathon. Results. Independent t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment were used to investigate {{the difference between the}} two groups, the results showed significant difference in the weekly <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> (p= 0. 00), longest and shortest <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> per week (p= 0. 00), and personal opinion on optimal weekly <b>training</b> <b>distance</b> for a marathon (p= 0. 00). Logistic regression modeling was then employed to determine variables that best predict the likelihood of completing a marathon. Conclusions. The findings indicate that the non-finishers are poorly prepared and the results also identify that the longest mileage covered per training session is the best predictor for a successful completion of a marathon with an odds of 1. 21.
