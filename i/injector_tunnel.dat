The role of {{stochastic}} cooling in the Recycler after the installation of electron cooling is to pre-cool the transverse phase-space of injected antiprotons for efficient electron cooling.

40|$|The {{determination}} of deformation of the reference points {{is very important}} for the final alignment process and the future performance of the FMI machine. In case of Main <b>Injector</b> <b>Tunnel</b> practically all points of the network were subject to deformation. The method of minimizing the first norm of the displacement vector of the reference points was chosen as the method to analyze the deformation experienced within the project.

40|$|The Fermilab Recycler is a fixed 8 GeV {{kinetic energy}} storage ring {{located in the}} Fermilab Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> near the ceiling. Electron cooling of high energy antiprotons has {{recently}} been demosntrated [1] at the Recycler. Antiproton beam Schottky signals were {{used to measure the}} antiproton momentum distribution at equilibrium between a calibrated broadband diffusion source and electron cooling. The large Recycler momentum aperture, the dependence of the electron cooling force {{as a function of the}} antiproton momentum deviation and the calibrated diffusion source combine to give a unique sepectral measurement of the antiproton beam momentum distribution...|$|E
40|$|Spin-LED's {{have been}} used as a {{powerful}} tool to demonstrate the electrical injection of spin-polarized carriers into a semiconductor. We first give a review of some of the injector strategies that {{have been used}} (oxide-based <b>tunnel</b> <b>injectors,</b> highly doped Schotty <b>tunnel</b> <b>injectors</b> and magnetic semiconductors) with focus on the obtained spin polarizations and the bias dependence of these polarizations. We then move to the electrical aspects of the contacts and show that these should not be overlooked. The oxide-based <b>tunnel</b> <b>injectors</b> suffer from a large parasitic hole current when they are used in a spin-LED, and may become incapable of injecting any electrons in an all-electrical (unipolar) injection-detection device. We discuss the origin of this effect and point out possible solutions both for Iota Iota Iota-V semiconductors and for Si. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of powering a large, high-Reynolds number transonic wind tunnel are briefly reviewed, and {{the advantages of}} an injector drive system are presented. This paper {{is based on the}} results of an experimental investigation of a series of injector configurations and test variables using a pilot wind tunnel with a 6 -in. -diameter test section. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the efficiency and flow quality of an <b>injector</b> driven wind <b>tunnel</b> and develop configurations that will reduce the initial cost of a wind tunnel without seriously reducing efficiency and flow quality. The results indicate that high efficiencies can be obtained and that injector drive does not compromise flow quality in a transonic wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{injection}} of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band of silicon {{is limited by}} the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal (FM) /silicon interface. In the present work, this "magnetically-dead" silicide (where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization) is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin <b>injector</b> from the <b>tunnel</b> junction base anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. This results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency, from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~ 2 % to ~ 35 % and an estimated spin polarization in Si from ~ 1 % to at least ~ 15 %. The injector tunnel-junction bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization...|$|R
40|$|The Fermilab Recycler is a fixed 8 GeV {{kinetic energy}} storage ring {{located in the}} Fermilab Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> near the ceiling. The Recycler has two roles in Run II. First, to store {{antiproton}}s from the Fermilab Antiproton Accumulator so that the antiproton production rate is no longer compromised by large numbers of antiprotons stored in the Accumulator. Second, to receive antiprotons from the Fermilab Tevatron {{at the end of}} luminosity periods. To perform each of these roles, stochastic cooling in the Recycler is needed to preserve and cool antiprotons in preparation for transfer to the Tevatron. The commissioning and performance of the Recycler stochastic cooling systems will be reviewed...|$|E
40|$|In June of 1999 Fermilab {{commissioned}} a newly constructed antiproton storage ring, the Recycler Ring, in the Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> directly above the Main Injector beamline. The Recycler Ring is a fixed 8 GeV kinetic energy storage ring and is constructed of strontium ferrite permanent magnets. The 3, 319. 4 -meter-circumference Recycler Ring consists of 344 gradient magnets and 100 quadrupoles {{all of which}} are permanent magnets. This paper discusses the methods employed to survey and align these permanent magnets within the Recycler Ring with the specified accuracy. The Laser Tracker was the major instrument used for the final magnet alignment. The magnets were aligned along the Recycler Ring with a relative accuracy of {+-} 0. 25...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve higher luminosities in Run II a {{separate}} antiproton storage ring {{was built in the}} Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel.</b> To reduce both construction and operations costs permanent magnets were used. This paper discusses the design criterion and specifications, including temperature dependence, longitudinal uniformity, and adjusting of the higher harmonics of the magnets. The design tolerances for a storage ring are more stringent than for a single pass beam line. The difference between the measured and ideal central field for each magnet was held to better than 0. 1 %. The temperature stability for all magnets was set to better than 0. 01 % per degree Celsius. Higher order harmonics relative to the central field were set to less than 0. 01 %. This was done for all 484 permanent magnet that were built. Comment: 8 p...|$|E
50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an <b>injector</b> and protection <b>tunnel.</b> While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7-8 kg/mÂ². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the technical {{design of the}} Fermilab Recycler Ring. The purpose of the Recycler is to augment the luminosity increase anticipated from {{the implementation of the}} Fermi III upgrade project, which has as its main component the Fermilab Main Injector construction project. The Recycler is a fixed 8 GeV kinetic energy storage ring. It is located in the Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> directly above the Main Injector beamline, near the ceiling. The construction schedule calls for the installation of the Recycler ring before the installation shutdown of the Main Injector. This aggressive construction schedule is made possible by the exclusive use of permanent magnets in the ring lattice, removing the need for expensive conventional iron/copper magnet construction along with the related power supplies, cooling water system, and electrical safety systems. The location, operating energy, and mode of construction are chosen to minimize operational impacts on both Fermilab`s ongoing High Energy Physics program and the Main Injector construction project...|$|E
40|$|System, {{developed}} for the 17. 5 GeV superconducting European XFEL (E-XFEL) that is currently being built between the DESY campus at Hamburg and Schenefeld at Schleswig-Holstein [1, 2], has been commissioned in a first system test setup at the E-XFEL Injector. As most of the electronic systems for machine control, diagnostics and safety of the E-XFEL will be located in cabinets inside the accelerator tunnel, the test setup incorporates all system parts like cabinet-internal and -external monitor electronics, infrastructure interface boards, firmware, software, cabling and sensors. Hence the commissioning system setup gives the possibility for first operation of the complete online radiation monitoring system under realistic environmental conditions in terms of irradiation, electro-magnetic interference (EMI) inside the <b>injector</b> <b>tunnel,</b> as well as operational and control system aspects. Commissioning results and measurements based on different internal and external sensor channels will be presented here, together with recent measurements done at different radiation sources using the high-sensibility mode for intra-rack radiation monitoring...|$|E
40|$|There is {{interest}} in the high energy physics community to upgrade the luminosity of the Tevatron Collider to a value greater than 1 x 10 33 cm - 2 sec - 1 per detector. The only feasible means to increase the luminosity by this factor of 10 over the design goal of the Main Injector project {{is to increase the}} antiproton production rate by almost the same factor. Using excess space in the Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> it is possible to build an additional storage ring whose purpose is to provide the flexibility necessary to produce and store the increased number of antiprotons. In this paper the motivation for this ring is discussed. The details of the scheme to recycle the antiprotons left over {{at the end of each}} Tevatron Collider store is also reviewed. I. MOTIVATION Given that Tevatron Collider luminosity is proportional to the initial antiproton intensity, which in turn depends on the rate at which antiprotons are produced (stacked), it is essential to understand how to generate high stac [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{permanent}} magnets {{for use in}} the Fermilab Main Injector "Recycler" ring is described. The magnets are a hybrid design with the field shape determined from accurately machined pole tips and the field driven by strontium ferrite blocks. The choice of magnetic material is discussed. A temperature compensation scheme has been demonstrated which uses a low Curie-temperature alloy to null out the intrinsic temperature coefficient to the ferrite. 1. 2 m prototype magnets have been constructed which achieve the design goal of dB/B < 10 - 4 over an aperture of 3. 5 "(h) x 2 "(v). I. INTRODUCTION Raising the luminosity of the Tevatron requires collecting and stacking more antiprotons. A key element in this is the "Recycler" ring [2], an 8 GeV storage ring located in the 3. 3 km Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> under construction at Fermilab [3] Permanent magnets are an attractive option because of the fixed energy and the 0. 1 T average guide field.

40|$|The Tevatron Collider {{provides}} the highest {{center of mass}} energy collisions in the world. To fully exploit this unique tool, Fermilab is committed to a program of accelerator upgrades {{for the purpose of}} increasing the Collider luminosity. Over the past 7 years the luminosity has been increased from a peak of 1. 6 {times} 10 {sup 30 }cm{sup {minus} 2 }sec{sup {minus} 1 } in 1989 to over 3 {times} 10 {sup 31 }cm{sup {minus} 2 }sec{sup {minus} 1 } during 1995. The Main Injector will supply a larger flux of protons for antiproton production and more intense proton bunches for use in the Collider, and this is expected to increase the peak luminosity to close to 1 {times} 10 {sup 32 }cm{sup {minus} 2 }sec{sup {minus} 1 }. Further increases in luminosity will require additional upgrades to the Fermilab accelerator complex. This report documents the design of a new fixed-energy storage ring to be placed in the Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> which will provide an initial factor of 2 increase to 2 {times} 10 {sup 32 }cm{sup {minus} 2 }sec{sup {minus} 1 }, and ultimately provide the basis for an additional order of magnitude luminosity increase up to 1 {times} 10 {sup 33 }cm{sup {minus} 2 }sec{sup {minus} 1 }...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{permanent}} magnets for transporting the 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster {{to the new}} Fermilab Main Injector accelerator has been implemented and the magnets for a new 8 GeV ring to be installed in the Main <b>Injector</b> <b>tunnel</b> for increasing the luminosity of pbar/p collisions in the Tevatron are about to start being produced. Strontium oxide ferrite was selected for the magnets due to it`s low cost and satisfactory magnetic properties for the 1. 5 kilogauss fields required in the 2 -inch gap magnets. Fermilab has received 96, 000 pounds of ferrite and by working with the Vendor (HITACHI, Edmore, MI) improved uniformity of Residual Induction (Br) has reached 3905 gauss {+-} 0. 65 %. Further details are given in the paper. Overcoming the magnetic field variation when {{the temperature of the}} magnets changes is accomplished by incorporation of approximately 30 % nickel steel alloy. The ferrite changes approximately {minus} 0. 2 % per degree C, which is compensated for by the 13 % by the volume of compensator alloy incorporated in the magnet. Fourteen thousand (14, 000) pounds of this material has been received and in order to obtain sufficient uniformity the authors mixed equal amounts from each batch into each magnet. Results of this process are given in the paper...|$|E
