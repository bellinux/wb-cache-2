I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2011, Alice in Chains {{announced}} that {{they were working on}} a fifth studio album, and both Cantrell and Inez later made statements that they had begun the recording process. The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell required surgery, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told me {{that this}} story about a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feeling about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell {{underwent}} {{shoulder surgery}} twice. In December 2005, a surgery {{in his left}} shoulder removed bone fragments and repaired cartilage. In May 2012, Cantrell revealed that, prior to the recording sessions of The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, he had another surgery in 2011, this time in his right shoulder. He explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issue in the other shoulder {{about six years ago}} so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." [...] While recuperating at home in a sling, Cantrell heard a riff in his head and sang it into his phone. The riff later became the song [...] "Stone", the first single from [...] "The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here".|$|E
