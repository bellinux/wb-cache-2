50|$|A pug <b>impression</b> <b>pad</b> (PIP) {{is made by}} {{preparing}} a layer of fine soil about 2 cm thick on forest paths so that animals will leave good footprint impressions. PIPs are widely used in India for the census of tigers. The first all-India tiger census in 1972 used this technique.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain good pug impressions, PIPs (pug <b>impression</b> <b>pads)</b> are laid along roads, animal tracks and footpaths. To cite an example, during the year 2002, in 71 Census Units of Similipal 8946 PIPs were laid over 1773 km of {{tracking}} routes, from which 764 pugmark tracings were collected along with 316 plaster casts.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Thulborn {{has used}} the term [...] "underprint" [...] {{to refer to a}} {{different}} phenomenon. Thulborn applied the term to track fossils created by the erosion of track casts where the removal of the cast from the track leaves only the <b>impressions</b> of <b>pads</b> in the underlying rock.|$|R
25|$|Deliberate {{impressions}} of fingerprints may be formed by ink or other substances {{transferred from the}} peaks of friction ridges on the skin to a relatively smooth surface such as a fingerprint card. Fingerprint records normally contain <b>impressions</b> from the <b>pad</b> on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, although fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers.|$|R
40|$|The first Pliocene {{marsupial}} fossil trackways from Australia are described. The trackways, {{attributed to}} Euowenia grata (De Vis) (Diprotodontoidea, Marsupialia), {{occur in the}} middle Pliocene Tirari Formation, Warburton River, northern South Australia. The trackways were formed as the animals made their way across a soft claypan. <b>Pad</b> <b>impressions,</b> subsequently infilled by a gypsum-cemented clay, indicate how weight was distributed within the pes.

40|$|Abstract Eubrontes- and Grallator-sized {{theropod}} footprints {{are known}} from two localities in the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation of the Sichuan Basin, southwest China. The larger footprints include a partial trackway with two successive pes imprints that were named as Pengxianpus cifengensis. Compared with robust Eubrontes, they have slender digits, less well-defined <b>pad</b> <b>impressions</b> and display a wider digit divarication {{similar to the}} theropod ichnotaxon Kayentapus from the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Presently, a synonymy of the latter cannot be proved conclusively and the ichnotaxon is retained here. For both footprints, some small areas preserve skin texture with polygonal scales, the clearest preservation is in a small area on the metatarsal-phalangeal pad IV of the second imprint. The smaller theropod footprints {{are also part of}} an incomplete trackway. They show a wide digit divarication similar to Kayentapus and Pengxianpus but they are here tentatively referred to theropod footprints indet. A peculiarity on the surface with Pengxianpus is the presence of small pes or manus imprints that can be assigned to mammal-like tetrapods somewhat similar to those known from Triassic-Jurassic strata of North America and southern Africa. This is the first report of mammal-like footprints in the Triassic o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{work on the}} Jurassic-Cretaceous {{transition}} of the Iberian Range (Spain) has opened a new window onto {{the interpretation of the}} trackmakers of some medium-sized tridactyl tracks. The ichnotaxon Therangospodus oncalensis has been described in the Huérteles Formation (Berriasian) {{and is one of the}} classical tracks from the area assigned to medium-sized theropods. Methodology/Principal Findings: A review of the type locality of Therangospodus oncalensis (Fuentesalvo tracksite) and other tracksites from the Huérteles Formation (Berriasian) has yielded new information on the morphology, gait and trackmaker identity of the aforementioned ichnospecies. The new data suggest that the trackmaker is an ornithopod rather than a theropod on the basis of the length/width ratio, the anterior triangle length-width ratio, the short steps, the round to quadrangular heel <b>pad</b> <b>impression</b> and the probable manus impressions. Conclusions/Significance: T. oncalensis shows similarities with various tracks from the Berriasian of Europe assigned to Iguanodontipus. The ichnotaxonomical status of this ichnospecies is here considered as Iguanodontipus? oncalensis due to the current state of knowledge of the ichnotaxonomy of medium-sized ornithopod tracks. This reassessment of I? oncalensis also has two significant implications for the palaeoecology of the faunas during the deposition of the Huérteles Formation: 1 - the high number and percentage of theropod tracks would b...|$|R
40|$|Large ornithopod {{tracks are}} {{known from the}} Upper Jurassic to the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous rocks of all continents but Antarctica. They include the tracks historically called Iguanodon footprints, iguanodontid footprints, hadrosaur/hadrosaurid footprints, and other large ornithopod tracks {{that have been used}} to define ichnotaxa. More than 40 ichnospecies based on large ornithopod tracks have been defined, but the validity of many of them is questionable. 34 ichnogenera and 44 ichnospecies have been analysed in this work. Many of them are considered to be invalid because they have been defined on the basis of poorly preserved tracks without diagnostic features, have an inadequate diagnosis, or are based on temporal and/or geographical criteria. Only eight ichnospecies belonging to the ichnogenera Caririchnium, Iguanodontipus and Hadrosauropodus are here regarded as valid. The monospecific ichnogenus Iguanodontipus (I. burreyi) is characterized by a small, rounded heel and elongate, narrow digit impressions. Its distribution is limited to the Berriasian-Valanginian of Europe. Caririchnium consists of four ichnospecies (C. magnificum [type ichnospecies], C. kortmeyeri, C. billsarjeanti and C. lotus) with a large, rounded heel and short, wide digit impressions. This ichnogenus ranges from the Berriasian-Hauterivian to the Aptian-Albian of South America, North America, Asia and Europe. Finally, Hadrosauropodus (three ichnospecies: H. langstoni [type ichnospecies], H. leonardii and H. kyoungsookimi) shows a large, bilobed heel and short, wide digit impressions. It is known from the Aptian-Albian to the Maastrichtian of North America, Asia and Europe. The ichnofamily Iguanodontipodidae includes large iguanodontian tracks characterized mainly by mesaxonic, tridactyl and subsymmetrical pes tracks that are as wide as (or wider than) long and have one <b>pad</b> <b>impression</b> in each digit and one in the heel. Its distribution is confidently limited to the Cretaceous of Europe, Asia, North America and South America...|$|R
40|$|A new ichnospecies {{of a large}} {{theropod}} dinosaur, Megalosauripus transjuranicus, {{is described}} from the Reuchenette Formation (Early-Late Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic) of NW Switzerland. It is based on very well-preserved and morphologically-distinct tracks (impressions) and several trackways, including different preservational types from different tracksites and horizons. All trackways were excavated along federal Highway A 16 near Courtedoux (Canton Jura) and systematically documented in the field including orthophotos and laserscans. The best-preserved tracks were recovered and additional tracks were casted. Megalosauripus transjuranicus is characterized by tridactyl tracks with clear claw and digital <b>pad</b> <b>impressions,</b> and notably an exceptionally large and round first phalangeal pad on the fourth digit (PIV 1) that is connected to digit IV and forms the round heel area. Due to this combination of features, M. transjuranicus clearly is of theropod (and not ornithopod) origin. M. transjuranicus is compared to other Megalosauripus tracks and similar ichnotaxa and other unassigned tracks from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. It is clearly different from other ichnogenera assigned to large theropods such as Eubrontes-Grallator from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic or Megalosauripus-Megalosauropus-Bueckeburgichnus and Therangospodus tracks from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. A second tridactyl morphotype (called Morphotype II) is different from Megalosauripus transjuranicus in being subsymmetric, longer than wide (sometimes almost as wide as long), with blunt toe impressions and no evidence for discrete phalangeal pad and claw marks. Some Morphotype II tracks are found in trackways that are assigned to M. transjuranicus, to M. ? transjuranicus or M. cf. transjuranicus indicating that some Morphotype II tracks are intra-trackway preservational variants of a morphological continuum of Megalosauripus transjuranicus. On the other hand, several up to 40 steps long trackways very consistently present Morphotype II features (notably blunt digits) and do not exhibit any of the features that are typical for Megalosauripus (notably phalangeal pads). Therefore, it is not very likely that these tracks are preservational variants of Megalosauripus transjuranicus or Megalosauripus isp. These trackways are interpreted to have been left by an ornithopod dinosaur. The high frequency of large theropod tracks in tidal-flat deposits of the Jura carbonate platform, associated on single ichnoassemblages with minute to medium-sized tridactyl and tiny to large sauropod tracks {{has important implications for}} the dinosaur community and for paleoenvironmental and paleogeographical reconstructions. As with most other known occurrences of Megalosauripus tracks, M. transjuranicus is found in coastal settings, which may reflect the preference of their theropod trackmakers for expanded carbonate flats where food was abundant...|$|R
