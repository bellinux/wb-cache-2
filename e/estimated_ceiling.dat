At 6:11p.m. EST, the pilots radioed the control tower that they were executing a standard approach maneuver before preparing to land. Air Traffic Control replied and gave the crew weather, visibility and other information regarding conditions at the airport. Moments after that transmission, the plane crashed into the side of Moose Mountain and disintegrated. The impact killed 30 of the 39 passengers and two of the crew members (31 on impact, one later). Emergency personnel arrived at the crash scene about 90 minutes afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{estimating}} the Bass model and other macro-level diffusion models with an unknown ceiling feature three curious empirical regularities: (i) the <b>estimated</b> <b>ceiling</b> is often {{close to the}} cumulative number of adopters in the last observation period, (ii) the estimated coefficient of social contagion or imitation tends to decrease as one adds later observations to the data set, and (iii) the estimated coefficient of social contagion or imitation tends to decrease systematically as the <b>estimated</b> <b>ceiling</b> increases. We analyze these patterns in detail, focusing on the Bass model and the nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation method. Using both empirical and simulated diffusion data, we show that NLS estimates of the Bass model coefficients are biased and that they change systematically as one extends the number of observations used in the estimation. We also identify the lack of richness in the data compared {{to the complexity of}} the model (known as ill-conditioning) as the cause of these estimation problems. In an empirical analysis of twelve innovations, we assess how the model parameter estimates change as one adds later observations to the data set. Our analysis shows that, on average, a 10 % increase in the observed cumulative market penetration is associated with, roughly, a 5 % increase in estimated market size, a 10 % decrease in the estimated co-efficient of imitation, and a 15 % increase the estimated co-efficient of innovation. A simulation study shows that the NLS parameter estimates of the Bass model change systematically as one adds later observations to the data set, {{even in the absence of}} model misspecification. We find about the same effect sizes as in the empirical analysis. The simulation also shows that the estimates are biased and that the amount of bias is a function of (i) the amount of noise in the data, (ii) the number of data points, and (iii) the difference between the cumulative penetration in the last observation period and the true penetration ceiling (i. e., the extent of right censoring). All three conditions affect the level of ill-conditioning in the estimation, which, in turn, affects bias in NLS regression. In situations consistent with marketing applications, can be underestimated by 20 %, underestimated by the same amount, and overestimated by 30 %. The existence of a downward bias in the estimate of and an upward bias in the estimate of, and the fact that these biases become smaller as the number of data points increases and the censoring decreases, can explain why systematic changes in the parameter estimates are observed in many applications. A reduced bias, though, is not the only possible explanation for the systematic change in parameter estimates observed in empirical studies. Not accounting for the growth in the population, for the effect of economic and marketing variables, or for population heterogeneity is likely to result in increasing and decreasing as well. In an analysis of six innovations, however, we find that attempts to address possible model misspecification problems by making the model more flexible and adding free parameters result in larger rather than smaller systematic changes in the estimates. The bias and systematic change problems we identify are sufficiently large to make long-term predictive, prescriptive and descriptive applications of Bass-type models problematic. Hence, our results should be of interest to diffusion researchers as well as to users of diffusion models, including market forecasters and strategic market planners. diffusion, estimation and other statistical techniques, forecasting...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} axisymmetric heat transfer from a small scale fire and resulting buoyant plume to a horizontal, unobstructed ceiling during {{the initial stages of}} development. A propane-air burner yielding a heat source strength between 1. 0 kW and 1. 6 kW was used to simulate the fire, and measurements proved that this heat source did satisfactorily represent a source of buoyancy only. The ceiling consisted of a 1 / 16 " steel plate of 0. 91 m. diameter, insulated on the upper side. The ceiling height was adjustable between 0. 5 m and 0. 91 m. Temperature measurements were carried out in the plume, ceiling jet, and on the ceiling. Heat transfer data were obtained by using the transient method and applying corrections for the radial conduction along the ceiling and losses through the insulation material. The ceiling heat transfer coefficient was based on the adiabatic ceiling jet temperature (recovery temperature) reached after a long time. A parameter involving the source strength Q and ceiling height H was found to correlate measurements of this temperature and its radial variation. A similar parameter for <b>estimating</b> the <b>ceiling</b> heat transfer coefficient was confirmed by the experimental results. This investigation therefore provides reasonable estimates for the heat transfer from a buoyant gas plume to a ceiling in the axisymmetric case, for the stagnation region where such heat transfer is a maximum and for the ceiling jet region (r/H ≤ 0. 7). A comparison with data from experiments which involved larger heat sources indicates that the predicted scaling of temperatures and heat transfer rates for larger scale fires is adequate. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{describe}} the elaboration and sensitivity analyses of a quantitative job-exposure matrix (SYN-JEM) for respirable crystalline silica (RCS). The {{aim was to}} gain insight into the robustness of the SYN-JEM RCS estimates based on critical decisions taken in the elaboration process. Methods: SYN-JEM for RCS exposure consists of three axes (job, region, and year) based on estimates derived from a previously developed statistical model. To elaborate SYN-JEM, several decisions were taken: i. e. the application of (i) a single time trend; (ii) region-specific adjustments in RCS exposure; and (iii) a prior job-specific exposure level (by the semi-quantitative DOM-JEM), with an override of 0 mg/m 3 for jobs a priori defined as non-exposed. Furthermore, we assumed that exposure levels reached a ceiling in 1960 and remained constant prior to this date. We applied SYN-JEM to the occupational histories of subjects from a large international pooled community-based case-control study. Cumulative exposure levels derived with SYN-JEM were compared with those from alternative models, described by Pearson correlation (Rp) and differences in unit of exposure (mg/m 3 -year). Alternative models concerned changes in application of job- and region-specific <b>estimates</b> and exposure <b>ceiling,</b> and omitting the a priori exposure ranking. Results: Cumulative exposure levels for the study subjects ranged from 0. 01 to 60 mg/m 3 -years, with a median of 1. 76 mg/m 3 -years. Exposure levels derived from SYN-JEM and alternative models were overall highly correlated (Rp > 0. 90), although somewhat lower when omitting the region estimate (Rp = 0. 80) or not {{taking into account the}} assigned semi-quantitative exposure level (Rp = 0. 65). Modification of the time trend (i. e. exposure ceiling at 1950 or 1970, or assuming a decline before 1960) caused the largest changes in absolute exposure levels (26 - 33 % difference), but without changing the relative ranking (Rp = 0. 99). Conclusions: Exposure estimates derived from SYN-JEM appeared to be plausible compared with (historical) levels described in the literature. Decisions taken in the development of SYN-JEM did not critically change the cumulative exposure levels. The influence of region-specific estimates needs to be explored in future risk analyses...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying the exploitable {{gap between}} average farmer yields and yield {{potential}} (YP) {{is essential to}} prioritize research and formulate policies for food security at national and international levels. While irrigated maize accounts for 58 % of total annual maize production in the Western U. S. Corn Belt, current yield gap in these systems has not been quantified. Our objectives were to quantify YP, yield gaps, {{and the impact of}} agronomic practices on both parameters in irrigated maize systems of central Nebraska. The analysis was based on a 3 -y database with field-specific values for yield, applied irrigation, and N fertilizer rate (n = 777). YP was estimated using a maize simulation model in combination with actual and interpolated weather records and detailed data on crop management collected from a subset of fields (n = 123). Yield gaps were estimated as the difference between actual yields and simulated YP for each field-year observation. Long-term simulation analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of YP to changes in selected management practices. Results showed that current irrigated maize systems are operating near the YP ceiling. Average actual yield ranged from 12. 5 to 13. 6 Mg ha− 1 across years. Mean N fertilizer efficiency (kg grain per kg applied N) was 23 % greater than average efficiency in the USA. Rotation, tillage system, sowing date, and plant population density were the most sensitive factors affecting actual yields. Average yield gap was 11 % of simulated YP (14. 9 Mg ha− 1). Time trends in average farm yields from 1970 to 2008 show that yields have not increased during the past 8 years. Average yield during this period represented ~ 80 % of YP <b>ceiling</b> <b>estimated</b> for this region based on current crop management practices. Simulation analysis showed that YP can be increased by higher plant population densities and by hybrids with longer maturity. Adoption of these practices, however, may be constrained by other factors such as difficulty in planting and harvest operations due to wet weather and snow, additional seed and grain drying costs, and greater risk of frost and lodging.

40|$|It is {{a popular}} {{contention}} that products launched today diffuse faster than products launched in the past. However, the evidence of diffusion acceleration is rather scant, and the methodology used in previous studies has several weaknesses. Also, {{little is known about}} why such acceleration would have occurred. This study investigates changes in diffusion speed in the United States over a period of 74 years (1923 – 1996) using data on 31 electrical household durables. This study defines diffusion speed as {{the time it takes to}} go from one penetration level to a higher level, and it measures speed using the slope coefficient of the logistic diffusion model. This metric relates unambiguously both to speed as just defined and to the empirical growth rate, a measure of instantaneous penetration growth. The data are analyzed using a single-stage hierarchical modeling approach for all products simultaneously in which parameters capturing the adoption <b>ceilings</b> are <b>estimated</b> jointly with diffusion speed parameters. The variance in diffusion speed across and within products is represented separately but analyzed simultaneously. The focus of this study is on description and explanation rather than forecasting or normative prescription. There are three main findings. 1. On average, there has been an increase in diffusion speed that is statistically significant and rather sizable. For the set of 31 consumer durables, the average value of the slope parameter in the logistic model's hazard function was roughly 0. 48, increasing with 0. 09 about every 10 years. It took an innovation reaching 5 % household penetration in 1946 an estimated 13. 8 years to go from 10 % to 90 % of its <b>estimated</b> maximum adoption <b>ceiling.</b> For an innovation reaching 5 % penetration in 1980, that time would have been halved to 6. 9 years. This corresponds to a compound growth rate in diffusion speed of roughly 2 % between 1946 and 1980. 2. Economic conditions and demographic change are related to diffusion speed. Whether the innovation is an expensive item also has a sizable effect. Finally, products that required large investments in complementary infrastructure (radio, black and white television, color television, cellular telephone) and products for which multiple competing standards were available early on (PCs and VCRs) diffused faster than other products once 5 % household penetration had been achieved. 3. Almost all the variance in diffusion speed among the products in this study can be explained by (1) the systematic increase in purchasing power and variations in the business cycle (unemployment), (2) demographic changes, and (3) the changing nature of the products studied (e. g., products with competing standards appear only late in the data set). After controlling for these factors, no systematic trend in diffusion speed remains unaccounted for. These findings are of interest to researchers attempting to identify patterns of difference and similarity among the diffusion paths of many innovations, either by jointly modeling the diffusion of multiple products (as in this study) or by retrospective meta-analysis. The finding that purchasing power, demographics, and the nature of the products capture nearly all the variance is of particular interest. Specifically, one does not need to invoke unobserved changes in tastes and values, as some researchers have done, to account for long-term changes in the speed at which households adopt new products. The findings also suggest that new product diffusion modelers should attempt to control not only for marketing mix variables but also for broader environmental factors. The hierarchical model structure and the findings on the systematic variance in diffusion speed across products are also of interest to forecasting applications when very little or no data are available.
