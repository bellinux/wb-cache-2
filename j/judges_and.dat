The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> public prosecutors, the profession of <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> prosecutors, the supervision of <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the Turkish Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (<b>judges</b> <b>and</b> magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
50|$|Like the Blessing of Moses, Genesis 49 {{assesses the}} Tribes of Israel, {{but there is}} little in common between the poems, except for {{describing}} one of the tribes as a <b>judge,</b> <b>and</b> another as a lion's cub.

5|$|New Zealand's judiciary, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts. <b>Judges</b> <b>and</b> judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence.

5|$|Prof. Freedman {{has argued}} that Bollman erred in {{applying}} ยง 14's proviso to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual <b>judges)</b> <b>and</b> thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's.

5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E
5|$|The {{state governments}} are {{structured}} in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature. The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected.

5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment.

5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Hand still {{regarded}} {{his main}} job as judging. As circuit leader, {{he sought to}} free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden. He concentrated on maintaining good relations with his fellow <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> on cleansing the court of patronage appointments.

This serves as an alternative ending where Marche never goes on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt <b>judges,</b> <b>and</b> becomes next in line for Cid's judge sword.|$|E
