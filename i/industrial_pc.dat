Most modern semiconductor ATEs include multiple computer-controlled instruments to source or measure a wide range of parameters. The instruments may include Device Power Supplies (DPS), Parametric Measurement Units (PMU), Arbitrary Waveform Generators (AWG), Digitizers, Digital IOs, and utility supplies. The instruments perform different measurements on the DUT, and the instruments are synchronized so that they source and measure waveforms at the proper times. Based on the requirement of response-time, real-time systems are also considered for stimulation and signal capturing.|$|E
