Ronnie then finds a profusely {{bleeding}} Danny and takes him to her house on a bayou to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her.

5|$|Crazy and Roz {{are then}} seen at a pier. Rozzie {{tells him that}} Vinnie is {{ditching}} town, her and the rumble, which makes Crazy {{the leader of the}} Stompers. Disgusted with Vinnie's cowardice, Roz allows Crazy to make love to her in an abandoned warehouse. Solly interrupts, and fights Crazy to get him to talk. As he is losing, Crazy lies, saying Vinnie killed the gang members. Vinnie packs up his things and leaves, but bumps into the Stompers and in time for the rumble. As the two gangs wait for Boogaloo to show up, Solly <b>drives</b> <b>up,</b> ready to arrest Vinnie.

25|$|Other {{causes of}} {{perceived}} insulation from risk may derive from a given entity's predominance {{in a market}} relative to other players, and not from state intervention or market regulation. A firm – or several large firms acting in concert (see cartel, oligopoly and collusion) – with very large holdings and capital reserves could instigate a market bubble by investing heavily in a given asset, creating a relative scarcity which <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> that asset's price. Because of the signaling power of the large firm or group of colluding firms, the firm's smaller competitors will follow suit, similarly investing in the asset due to its price gains.|$|E

Of this, 1GB is reserved for the operating system and is unavailable to games. The memory architecture allows the CPU and GPU to access both the main DDR3 memory pool and the eDRAM cache memory pool on the GPU, removing the need for separate, dedicated memory pools. The console includes either an 8GB (Basic) or 32GB (Deluxe (NA) / Premium (WW)) internal eMMC flash memory, expandable via SD memory cards up to 32GB and USB external hard disk <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> to 2TB.|$|E

500|$|More favorably, Aaron Sagers of the {{newspaper}} The Morning Call saw Gravemind as {{a perfect example of}} a trend in pop culture called a [...] "frenemy". A frenemy, according to Sagers, is a friend or rival [...] "with whom [...] feuds; an individual who reinvigorates the sense of self-worth and <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> one's visibility in the public's eye." [...] Gravemind, operating as a frenemy, served to personify the Master Chief's otherwise nebulous fight against the Flood. Will Prusik of PlanetXbox360 listed the Flood {{as one of the great}} video game aliens, and that the revelation of a central Flood intelligence was a good idea despite the Gravemind's resemblance to Audrey II.|$|E

[...] Strasser, tipped off by Renault, <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> alone. Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene.

500|$|Somerset {{experimented with}} Kieswetter {{throughout}} the order, {{trying to find}} the most effective place for him. He began as a middle-order batsman, {{but by the end of}} the 2007 season, although he remained in the middle-order in first-class cricket, Kieswetter regularly found himself opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in one-day cricket, a role he would also take up in opening six matches of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, although he later dropped back into the middle order to improve the balance of the side. On his international call-up, England chose to use Kieswetter as an opening batsman. He was selected [...] "because of his proven ability to pierce the field in the Powerplay overs, particularly with his booming <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> and over the covers." [...] He later moved down the order for England to accommodate Kevin Pietersen as opener.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Usher {{sits in a}} car {{outside a}} house where his ex-girlfriend is being {{intimate}} with another man. He pulls a gun out of his glove compartment and agonizes {{over whether or not}} to enter the house. After ruminating over the different scenarios, Usher drives off {{at the end of the}} video. Jason Lipshut of Billboard found the [...] "narrative arc" [...] for the video to be [...] "a bit perplexing". Jeff Lapointe of MTV News viewed that it [...] "depicts the darker side of human nature as Usher <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> to his girlfriend/ex-girlfriends house to discover another vehicle, another man, another side of his love. In the realization of fury and anger, images distort Usher's reality with thoughts of taking his gun and shooting the intruder. Thoughts of running away with the girl.

2500|$|In the 2008 Journal of the American Medical Association article [...] "The Perfect Storm of Overutilization" [...] Emanuel said, [...] "Overall, US {{health care}} {{expenditures}} are 2.4 times {{the average of}} those of all developed countries ($2759 per person), yet health outcomes for US patients, whether measured by life expectancy, disease-specific mortality rates, or other variables, are unimpressive." [...] He said that expensive drugs and treatments that provide only marginal benefits are the largest problems. Fee-for-service payments, physician directed pharmaceutical marketing, and medical malpractice laws and the resultant defensive medicine encourage overutilization. Direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies also <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> costs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{has often}} been the pattern in Manhattan, a {{neighborhood}} that is [...] "discovered" [...] by artists and bohemians and then becomes [...] "hip" [...] will often begin to attract more affluent residents, which <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> the price of housing, and begins to drive out the residents who [...] "turned over" [...] the neighborhood. This is one theory of gentrification, and some argue that it has also occurred in the New York City neighborhoods SoHo and Tribeca in Manhattan, as well as Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Over the course of time, this demographic shift begins to change the essential character of the neighborhood: it becomes safer, more comfortable, less tolerant of noise, and less [...] "edgy". Some gentrification opponents say that this process causes the neighborhood to lose its unique identity {{for the sake of}} money.|$|E

2500|$|Today, jobs {{specialize}} in {{the selling of}} ice cream. The title {{of a person who}} works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also {{specialize in}} the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who <b>drives</b> <b>up</b> {{to the top of the}} beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. [...] In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.|$|E
