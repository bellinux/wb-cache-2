2500|$|Several trials on {{the safety}} and {{teratogenicity}} of nitrofurantoin in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A retrospective study in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ophthalmic malformations, cleft lip and cleft palate, and atrial septal defect, were more common in neonates exposed to nitrofurantoin during pregnancy. A meta analysis of four out of twenty-two available studies {{on the safety}} of nitrofurantoin found no increased risk. A case-control study in 1998 found {{an increased risk of}} craniosynostosis after exposure to [...] "nitrosatable" [...] drugs. A more recent 2013 population-based cohort study which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took nitrofurantoin in early pregnancy. Many of the studies showing increased risk of nitrofurantoin had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to recall bias. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest <b>effective</b> <b>duration.</b>|$|E

One {{strategy}} for improving grain yield in the early-maturing group involves assessment of grain-filling traits as secondary traits for selection for high grain yield. In this study, we investigated {{the possibility of}} using grain-filling rate and duration for improving grain yield in early-maturing tropical maize. Forty-four hybrids generated using North Carolina design II were evaluated at CIMMYT-Zimbabwe during the 2011 / 2012 season under irrigated and nonirrigated environments. Although grain-filling rate and <b>effective</b> grain-filling <b>duration</b> were negatively correlated, several hybrids were distinctly above the trend line. The earliest-maturing hybrid took 127 d to reach physiological maturity and produced grain yields comparable to those of the medium-maturing genotypes (7 t ha− 1).

The microcosm study confirmed the process of aerobic cometabolism of TCE using toluene as the primary substrate. Based on the nucleotide sequence of 16 S rRNA genes, the toluene-oxidizing bacteria in microcosms were identified, i. e. Ralstonia sp. P- 10 and Pseudomonas putida. The first-order constant of TCE-degradation rate was 0. 5 day(- 1) for both Ralstonia sp. P- 10 and P putida. The TCE cometabolic-biodegradation efficiency measured from the slurry microcosms was 46 %, which appeared pessimistic compared to over 90 % observed from the in-situ pilot study. The difference in the TCE cometabolic-biodegradation efficiency was likely due to the reactor configurations and the <b>effective</b> time <b>duration</b> of toluene presence in laboratory microcosms (1 days) versus in-situ pilot study (3 days).
