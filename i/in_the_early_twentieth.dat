5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that {{of visiting}} artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations {{for the work}} of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.|$|E

5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E
25|$|As climate warmed further around 3,000 B.C., beech, walnut, hickories, chestnut, and {{butternut}} grew. These trees produced nuts {{for feeding}} Archaic hunters; Archaic Indian populations grew more rapidly. As populations grew, large families became small tribes in various areas. During {{this time the}} 12 prominent hardwood tree species of Eastern North America existed in Warren County, which were Ash, Beech, Birch, Cherry, Chestnut, Elm, Hickory, Maple, Oak, Sweet Gum, Sycamore, and Walnut. The Chestnut tree is now extinct in Warren County, following the Chestnut blight that decimated <b>the</b> eastern U.S. <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. <b>The</b> Archaic period lasted from 8000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.|$|R

5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century to 16,178 in 2001.

5|$|Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872– 8 June 1913) was a suffragette {{who fought}} for votes {{for women in the}} United Kingdom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.

5000|$|Ringer {{moved to}} Reno, Nevada in 1939, and began his lifelong {{practice}} of traveling {{to explore the}} west, making journal entries about his travels while taking what are now estimated to be almost 10,000 photographs.

When in 1989 Jim Stiles began publishing the Canyon Country Zephyr (motto: [...] "Clinging Hopelessly to the Past Since 1989") in Moab, Utah, among the regular features were Ringer's photos and his recollections of <b>the</b> west <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type {{was really the}} work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were.

ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
