Microbiol. 34 : 681 [...] 688, 1977) was "separated" from other sludge components and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. The infrared spectrum of this material was quite similar to the spectra of commercial anionic <b>detergents,</b> and subsequent analyses of the fractionated sludge samples revealed that anionic <b>detergents</b> in sludge were copurified with the virucidal activity. Further measurements on the virucidal activities of specific <b>detergents</b> revealed that ionic <b>detergents</b> reduce the heat required to inactivate reovirus, that cationic <b>detergents</b> are more active than anionic, and that nonionic <b>detergents</b> are inactive. Several <b>detergents</b> were also shown to protect poliovirus and other enteroviruses against inactivation by heat. These results indicate that ionic <b>detergents</b> are the major component in wastewater sludge that reduce the thermal stability of reovirus and, in addition, that <b>detergents</b> are able to protect enteroviruses against heat...|$|R
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (<b>detergent</b> such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The <b>detergent</b> causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a <b>detergent</b> {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals.

Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem.

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of {{synthetic}} <b>detergents</b> and wetting agents on respiration and glycolysis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms has led to the following conclusions. 1. All the cationic <b>detergents</b> studied are very effective inhibitors of bacterial metabolism at 1 : 3000 concentration, and several are equally active at 1 : 30, 000. Few of the anionic <b>detergents</b> inhibit as effectively as the cationic compounds. 2. Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms are equally sensitive to the action of the cationic <b>detergents.</b> On the other hand, all the anionic <b>detergents</b> included in our studies selectively inhibit the metabolism of Gram-positive microorganisms. 3. The inhibitory action of both types of <b>detergents</b> is influenced markedly by hydrogen ion concentration. Cationic <b>detergents</b> exhibit their maximum activity in the alkaline pH range, and the anionic, in the acid range. 4. Studies of homologous series of straight chain alkyl sulfates and sulfoacetates (C 8 to C 18) demonstrate that maximum inhibition is exerted by the 12, 14, and 16 carbon compounds (lauryl, myristyl, and cetyl). 5. It has been observed that three lauryl esters of amino acids are powerful inhibitors of bacterial metabolism. To our knowledge, the effects on bacterial metabolism of such cationic <b>detergents</b> (without the quaternary ammonium structure) have not been studied previously. Our results demonstrate that other cationic <b>detergents</b> can exhibit an inhibitory activity comparable to quaternary ammonium compounds. 6. Certain <b>detergents</b> stimulate bacterial metabolism at concentrations lower than the inhibiting values. This effect has been found more frequently among the anionic <b>detergents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Partial {{resistance}} of cell membranes to solubilization with mild <b>detergents</b> and {{the analysis of}} isolated detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) have been used operationally to define membrane domains. Given the multitude of <b>detergents</b> used for this purpose, we sought to investigate whether extraction with different <b>detergents</b> might reflect the same underlying principle of domain formation.

In addition, we observed cell type-dependent variations of the molecular characteristics of DRMs and the effectiveness of particular <b>detergents.</b> These results make it unlikely that different <b>detergents</b> reflect the same aspects of membrane organization and underscore both the structural complexity of cell membranes and the need for more sophisticated analytical tools to understand their architecture...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effects of various types of <b>detergents</b> on the {{swelling}} of isolated mitochondria and on mitochondrial ATPases which are activated by Mg or DNP respectively. The rate of swelling was measured in the Beckman spectrophotometer by following the decrease in turbidity of dilute suspensions of these organelles. It was found that non-ionic <b>detergents</b> containing a nonyl phenoxy side chain or anionic <b>detergents</b> caused swelling of the mitochondria and activation of Mg-ATPase. On the other hand, cationic <b>detergents</b> promoted the clumping of mitochondria and did not activate Mg-ATPase. DNP-ATPase was inhibited by all of the <b>detergents</b> tested. It would appear from these observations that the inhibition of DN'P-ATPase is not related to a gross change in the morphology of the organelles; in contrast, the activation of Mg-ATPase definitely is correlated with swelling of the isolated mitochondria.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to examine GLUT 1 quaternary structure. Independent but complementary methodologies {{were used to}} investigate the influence of membrane-solubilizing <b>detergents</b> on GLUT 1 /lipid/detergent micelle hydrodynamic radii. Hydrodynamic size analysis and electron microscopy of GLUT 1 /lipid/detergent micelles and freeze-fracture electron microscopy of GLUT 1 proteoliposomes {{support the hypothesis that}} the glucose transporter is a multimeric (probably tetrameric) complex of GLUT 1 proteins. GLUT 1 forms a multimeric complex in octyl glucoside that dissociates upon addition of reductant. Some <b>detergents</b> (e. g., CHAPS and dodecyl maltoside) promote the dissociation of GLUT 1 oligomers into smaller aggregation states (dimers or monomers). These complexes do not reassemble as larger oligomers when dissociating <b>detergents</b> are subsequently replaced with nondissociating <b>detergents</b> such as octyl glucoside or cholic acid. When dissociating <b>detergents</b> are replaced with lipids, the resulting proteoliposomes catalyze protein-mediated sugar transport, and the subsequent addition of solubilizing, nondissociating <b>detergents</b> generates higher (tetrameric) GLUT 1 aggregation states. These findings suggest that some <b>detergents</b> stabilize while others destabilize GLUT 1 quaternary structure.
