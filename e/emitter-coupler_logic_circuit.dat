Reliability analysis of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is computationally complex because of the exponential number of inputs, combinations, and correlations in gate failures. This paper presents three accurate and scalable algorithms for reliability analysis of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The first algorithm, called observability-based reliability analysis, provides a closedform expression for reliability and is accurate when single gate failures are dominant in a <b>logic</b> <b>circuit.</b> The second algorithm, called single-pass reliability analysis, computes reliability in a single topological walk through the <b>logic</b> <b>circuit.</b> It computes the exact reliability for circuits without reconvergent fan-out, even {{in the presence of}} multiple gate failures.

40|$|<b>Logic</b> <b>circuit</b> {{designers}} for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) put increasing {{demands on}} Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools to provide higher <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> speeds than are possible using a traditional CAD flow. The {{problem with the}} traditional CAD flow lies in that the logic synthesis makes assumptions about how its logic optimizations will affect {{the speed of the}} <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> post-routing. These assumptions are not always realized by the place and route tool, which leads to a degradation in <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> speed. If the post-routing effect of a logic optimization was known, then better <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> optimization decisions could be made. This work refers to such knowledge as omniscience and explores its applications in the domain of manual physical synthesis. This work develops a manual editor, named Augur, which uses omniscience in the context of physical synthesis. The user is allowed to select physical synthesis transformations to improve the speed of the <b>logic</b> <b>circuit.</b> After each modification the user is instantly informed about the effect of the specified transformation on the speed of the <b>logic</b> <b>circuit.</b> Because of the manual nature of the editor the size of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is limited to 1000 logic elements.

40|$|As the CMOS {{technology}} scales {{down towards}} nanoscale dimensions, there are increasing transistor reliability challenges which impact {{the lifetime of}} integrated circuits. These issues are known as aging effects, which result in degradation {{of the performance of}} circuits. NBTI (Negative biased temperature instability) is a well known aging phenomenon which {{is also one of the}} limiting factors for future scaling of devices. In this project we will analyze the impact of NBTI on performance of dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Dynamic <b>logic</b> is a popular design methodology in high speed digital electronics. We will first analyze the impact of NBTI on performance metrics of a dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuit,</b> namely, delay, power, and Unity Noise Gain (UNG). It is observed that the aging of the PMOS keeper transistor and the PMOS in the output inverter of a dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> have opposing effects of the dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> performance under NBTI. This provides the opportunity to nullify the effect of NBTI on aging of a dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> by carefully optimizing the sizing of the keeper and the inverter PMOS transistors. We propose PMOS sizing optimization to reduce the impact of the reliability issues in dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Our results show that optimal sizing of the PMOS transistors in a dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>circuit,</b> the circuit becomes immune to the NBTI aging effect.

40|$|Possibility for {{realization}} of sub- 0. 5 V extremely low power <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is investigated in this thesis. Transistor variations at low {{power supply voltage}} degrade the operation of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Thus, the effects of transistor variations are investigated at low VDD and countermeasures against them are proposed in the thesis. Reduction of power supply voltage (VDD) is an effective method for achieving ultra low power <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> since active power is proportional to VDD 2 and leakage power is proportional to VDD. Although circuits exhibit slower speeds at low supply voltage, low voltage operation of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> remains attractive for energy-constrained systems. Besides, when VDD is near/below the threshold voltage (VTH) of transistors, <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> operate most efficiently. In this way, lowering power supply voltage achieves low power and energy efficient operation. Transistor variations, however, inhibit lowering VDD, because the sensitivity of circuits to transistor variations drastically increases under reduced VDD. The main obstacles for low voltage operation of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> are function errors and delay variations of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits,</b> because one function error at a single logic gate is considered as the function error of whole circuits and the delay variations makes the design of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> more difficult at low VDD. These problems {{must be dealt with}} properly in the design of low voltage <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Thus, the purpose of the thesis is to reveal the effect of these two problems on <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> and propose countermeasures to achieve sub- 0. 5 V extremely low power <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> At first, function error of logic gates is discussed in 65 nm CMOS. Function errors prevent lowering VDD of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The minimum operating voltage (VDDmin) is defined as the minimum power supply voltage when the circuits operate without function errors. VDDmin increases with the number of logic gates and CMOS technology down-scaling. Thus, reducing VDDmin of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is important to achieve extremely low voltage <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The determinant factors of VDDmin in <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> are investigated, and the design criteria to reduce VDDmin are presented. VDDmin consists of VDDmin(SYS) and VDDmin(RAND). VDDmin(RAND) which is random component of VDDmin depends on the random variation of threshold voltage of transistors and the number of stages of logic gates, while VDDmin(SYS) which is systematic component of VDDmin is determined by the balance of nMOS and pMOS and is minimized when the logic threshold voltage is equal to half VDD. Therefore, VDDmin(RAND) is reduced by increasing width of nMOS and width of pMOS, while VDDmin(SYS) is minimized by optimizing WP/WN at a design stage. The body-biasing is effective to compensate for the increase of VDDmin(SYS) due to the die-to-die VTH variation. The optimal body-biasing minimizes VDDmin(SYS) and the forward body biasing decreases VDDmin(RAND). In the measurement, VDDmin is successfully reduced by 45 mV from 193 mV to 148 mV by the forward body biasing. Next, the effect of delay variations on <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is explored in 65 nm CMOS. Delay variations of logic gates make it difficult for logic gate paths to meet timing constraints. If enough setup timing margins are considered, operation frequency decreases. By contrast, to meet hold time constraint, hold compensation buffers are inserted into logic gate paths. Therefore, the within-die delay variation dependence on VDD in several types of design under tests (DUT's) is measured with a proposed circuit. The proposed circuit emulates a real logic path because DUT's are inserted between F/F's and F/F-related delays are included in the delay measurement. The main focus of the measurement is dependence of the <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> on the methodology of physical layout. Although, layout of <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> is usually designed by automatically using place and route (P&R) tools, the effect of the auto P&R layout on delay variation is not clear at low voltage. Thus, DUT delay dependence on methodology of physical layout is investigated. The measurement result reveals that relative delay variation difference (=sigma/average) between the manual layout and the P&R layout rapidly decreases from 1. 56 % to 0. 07 % with reducing VDD from 1. 2 V to 0. 4 V, because the random delay variations due to the random transistor variations dominate total delay variations at low VDD. This result indicates that low voltage <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> designed by P&R tools do not raise delay variations at low VDD. Finally, in order to achieve ultra low VDD <b>logic</b> <b>circuits,</b> a post-fabrication dual VDD control (PDVC) of multiple voltage domains is proposed. Reducing VDDmin at a design phase is difficult because VDDmin is mainly determined by random variations of transistors. Furthermore, only one functional error of logic gates increases VDDmin of a whole <b>logic</b> <b>circuit.</b> Therefore, in order to reduce VDDmin, VDD must be controlled with multiple domains. In the proposed PDVC, the layout of the whole <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> is divided into many domains regardless of the functional blocks. The VDD of each domain is independently selected from high VDD (VDDH) and low VDD (VDDL). PDVC is applied to a DES CODEC's circuit fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. The layout of DES CODEC's is generated by P&R tools and divided into 64 VDD domains. VDDH or VDDL is applied to each domain and the selection of VDD's is performed based on multiple built-in self tests. VDDH is selected in VDDmin-critical domains, while VDDL is selected in VDDmin-non-critical domains. As a result, a maximum 24 % power reduction was measured with the proposed PDVC at 300 kHz, VDDH = 437 mV, and VDDL= 397 mV. The results of the thesis, which includes investigation on and countermeasures against VDDmin and delay variation, is useful to realize sub- 0. 5 V extremely low power <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> for future LSI applications. 報告番号: 甲 27940; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 7708 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|R
