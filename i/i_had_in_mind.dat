500|$|For New Amerykah Part One, Badu collaborated principally with Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, Karriem Riggins, James Poyser, audio {{engineer}} Mike [...] "Chav" [...] Chavarria, and {{the members}} of musical group Sa-Ra, who made production and lyrical contributions to most of the tracks. She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.' And that's what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for this project".|$|E
500|$|David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, {{the real-life}} {{inventor}} who creates a teleportation device for Angier. For {{the role of}} Nikola Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was [...] "extraordinarily charismatic". Nolan said that [...] "David Bowie was really the only guy <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role". Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him {{no one else could}} possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes.|$|E
500|$|Tomb of Horrors {{was written}} by Gary Gygax for {{official}} D tournament play at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien, one of his original AD playtesters, [...] "and I admit to chuckling evilly as I did so." [...] Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, [...] "There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill—and the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> foiling Rob Kuntz's PC, Robilar, and Ernie Gygax's PC, Tenser." [...] Second, {{so that he was}} [...] "ready for those fans [...] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD game." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away.

Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, Showgirls {{is shown}} at midnight movies {{alongside}} {{such films as}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It is heralded {{as one of the}} best [...] "bad movies", a camp classic in the vein of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time bestsellers. Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying [...] "Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion." [...] Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: [...] "What Paul [...] and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was something darkly funny. We went through the script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people to tell me that a line like, 'How does it feel not to have anybody coming on you anymore' isn't meant to be funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{had seen}} Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper {{and found him}} [...] "repulsive and scary, but captivating". The actor had read Ellroy's The Black Dahlia but not L.A. Confidential. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White's [...] "self-righteous moral crusade". Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script {{and showed it to}} the film's producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud. Guy Pearce auditioned like countless other actors, and Hanson felt that he [...] "was very much what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for Ed Exley." [...] The {{director}} purposely did not watch the actor in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, [...] "I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... But I liked how honest he became about himself. I knew I could grow to respect and understand him." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameZone's Michael Lafferty {{scored the}} Xbox version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{essence of the}} fantastic {{adventure}} is there, and while the game does chart an extremely linear path through the lands of Middle-earth, there are enough challenges along the route to enable players to joyfully experience the urgency and terror of the journey." [...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games. He concluded [...] "this has [...] "licensed toss" [...] written all over it. The goal was [...] "to create the most authentic Lord of the Rings game experience possible."
