5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} ten, he was {{studying}} under his uncle, a noted physician who had once treated the emperor Go-Yōzei. He also likely studied with Matsunaga Sekigo, a Kyoto-based Neo-Confucian scholar who had in turn studied with Fujiwara Seika. Given the distinctively Kyoto lineage of Jinsai's learning, there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> interpreting it {{as an expression of}} the philosophical world of the ancient imperial capital.|$|E
25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E
2500|$|Alvin Plantinga {{writes that}} the {{statement}} [...] "We can see no <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> God to do X" [...] only implies [...] "There is no <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> God to do X" [...] {{on the assumption that}} [...] "If there were a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> God to do X, {{we would be able to}} see it," [...] which he suggests is absurd. This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> God to permit nonbelief.|$|R

25|$|During the afternoon, {{the chief}} petty {{officers}} and petty officers {{were asked to}} confirm {{that they would not}} join the mutineers. Although they expressed similar concerns as the sailors (and {{because of the way the}} pay rates scaled for higher enlisted ranks, were worse off than before), and did not agree with the handling of the mutiny by the RNZN and the government, they all agreed to remain on duty. Over the following days, another 20 personnel who were sick or otherwise not present on 3 April applied to be discharged under similar conditions to the mutineers. Six were discharged: some were sailors whose previous application for demobilisation had been refused, the rest showed <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> ending their service on compassionate grounds.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{also had}} <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours at work (on {{the eve of}} the war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

500|$|An {{assessment}} of Óengus is problematic, {{not least because}} annalistic sources provide very little information on Scotland in the succeeding generations.

500|$|This {{focus on}} {{accuracy}} {{was a challenge}} for Staten, as he believes his audience is highly intelligent, willing, and able to report flaws; fellow Bungie employees cross-referenced his drafts with the [...] "Halo Story Bible" [...] to ensure canonical agreement. One example of fans taking Staten to task over the novel occurred soon after the novel's cover was revealed in July 2007. The cover depicts the protagonist, Sergeant Avery Johnson holding a weapon known as the Battle Rifle. As the weapon was first introduced in the video game Halo 2 and the events of Contact Harvest take place decades before the game, fans were quick to say that Staten had made a mistake. Staten later pointed out he had <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> including the offending weapon in the book, and justified the inclusion by stating that the weapon is a prototypical form of the version players use in the game.|$|E
500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E
500|$|Boganda {{was poised}} {{to become the first}} {{president}} of the independent CAR when he boarded a plane at Berbérati for a flight to Bangui on 29 March 1959, just prior to legislative elections. The aircraft exploded in midair over Boukpayanga in the sub-prefecture of Boda (about [...] west of Bangui), killing all passengers and crew. No clear cause has ever been ascertained for the mysterious crash and no commission of inquiry was ever formed; sabotage was widely suspected. The nation was shocked at the death of its revered leader, whose funeral on 2 April at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Bangui saw a great outpouring of grief from thousands of Oubanguians. The 7 May edition of the Paris weekly L'Express revealed that experts had found traces of explosive in the wreckage, but the French high commissioner banned the sale of that magazine edition when it appeared in the CAR. Many suspected that expatriate businessmen from the Bangui chamber of commerce, possibly aided by the French secret service, played a role. Michelle Jourdain was also suspected of being involved: by 1959, relations between Boganda and his wife had deteriorated, and he thought of leaving her and returning to the priesthood. She had a large insurance policy on his life, taken just days before the accident. According to Brian Titley, author of Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa, there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> suspecting her involvement in the plane crash.|$|E

500|$|Legal {{certainty}} and {{the orderly}} development of legal principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of stare decisis, also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the ratio decidendi (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E
500|$|On May17,2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of The Seattle Times {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. [...] "We believe there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> a more honest dialogue about {{the positive and negative}} effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show The Simpsons highlighted {{the pros and cons of}} marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from the pain in his eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. [...] "These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, and we would be hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are [...] "Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} prose sketch for Das Rheingold {{consisted of}} just three paragraphs, each prefaced by a Roman numeral. It would appear from this that Wagner originally conceived it as a three-act opera {{in its own}} right, and this is confirmed by a letter he wrote in October 1851 to his friend Theodor Uhlig: [...] "Great plans for Siegfried: three dramas, with a three-act prelude.". By 1852, however, Das Rheingold had become a one-act opera in four scenes. Nevertheless, there are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> regarding the opening scene of the opera as a prologue ("The Theft of the Gold") to {{the main part of}} the drama ("Valhalla"). Thus, both Das Rheingold and Götterdämmerung share the same prologue-plus-trilogy structure which characterises the Ring cycle as a whole.|$|E

[...] Lewis believed instead in purgatory as presented in John Henry Newman's The Dream of Gerontius.
