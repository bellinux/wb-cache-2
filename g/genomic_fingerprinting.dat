The chromosome of C. tetani contains 2, 799, 250 bp with a G+C {{content of}} 28. 6 %. The {{aim of this}} study was identification and <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> of the vaccine strain of C. tetani. Materials and Methods: The vaccine strain of C. tetani was provided by Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute. The seeds were inoculated into Columbia blood agar and grown for 72 h and transferred to the thioglycolate broth medium for further 36 h culturing. The cultures were incubated at 35 ºC in anaerobic conditions. DNA extraction with phenol/ chloroform method was performed. After extraction, the consistency of DNA was assayed. Next, the vaccine strain was digested using pvuII enzyme and incubated at 37 ºC for overnight. The digested DNA was gel-electrophoresed by 1 % agarose for a short time. Then, the gel was studied with Gel Doc system and transferred to Hybond N+membrane using standard DNA blotting techniques. Results: The vaccine strain of C. tetani genome was fingerprinted by RFLP technique. Our preliminary results showed no divergence exists in the vaccine strain used for the production tetanus toxoid during the periods of 1990 - 2011. Conclusion: Observation suggests that there is lack of significant changes in RFLP <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> profile of the vaccine strain.

All isolates were initially characterized by BOX-PCR <b>genomic</b> DNA <b>fingerprinting,</b> and 60 distinct genotypes were identified. Analyses of 16 S rRNA gene sequences of representatives of each genotype showed that five and eight different phylotypes of purple nonsulfur bacteria {{were obtained from the}} Haren and De Biesbosch sites, respectively. At the Haren site, 80. 5 % of the clones were Rhodopseudomonas palustris, whereas Rhodoferax fermentans and Rhodopseudomonas palustris were numerically dominant at the De Biesbosch site and constituted 45. 9 and 34. 4 % of the isolates obtained, respectively. BOX-PCR <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprints</b> showed that there was a high level of genotypic diversity within each of these species. The <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of Rhodopseudomonas palustris isolates were significantly different for isolates from the two sampling sites, suggesting that certain strains may be endemic to each sampling site. Not all Rhodopseudomonas palustris isolates could degrade benzoate, a feature that has previously been thought to be characteristic of the species. There were differences in the BOX-PCR <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprints</b> and restriction fragment length polymorphisms of benzoate-coenzyme A ligase genes and form I and form H ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) genes between benzoate-degrading and non-benzoate-degrading genotypes.

As confirmed by sequencing of a bla gene PCR fragment, all isolates expressed the SHV- 5 -type beta-lactamase. <b>Genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> of epidemic strains with XbaI and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped 20 of 21 isolates from ward A into two consecutive clusters which included 1 of 3 ward B isolates. All six K. pneumoniae isolates from ward C formed a third cluster. Stool isolates of asymptomatic patients and environmental isolates belonged to these clusters as well. Additionally, 2, 600 routine K. pneumoniae isolates from the surrounding provinces (population, 900, 000) were screened for SHV- 5 production. Only one of six nonepidemic isolates producing SHV- 5 beta-lactamase was matched with the outbreak strains by <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting.</b> Plasmid fingerprinting, however, revealed the epidemic spread of a predominant R-plasmid, with a size of approximately 80 kb, associated with 29 of the 30 K. pneumoniae isolates. This plasmid was also present in the single K. oxytoca and E. coli isolates from ward C and in three nonepidemic isolates producing SHV- 5. Our results underline that strain typing exclusively on the genomic level can be misleading in the epidemiological investigation of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Our evidence for multiple events of R-plasmid transfer between species of the family Enterobacteriaceae in this nosocomial outbreak stresses the need for plasmid typing, especially because SHV- 5 beta-lactamase seems to be regionally spread predominantly via plasmid transfer...|$|E

Fingerprinting was done by Southern blot hybridization with DNA probes for the genes encoding the S. aureus collagen adhesin (cna), fibronectin-binding proteins (fnbA and fnbB), and beta-toxin (hlb). Genomic DNA was digested with HaeIII (cna and fnbA-fnbB probes) or HindIII (hlb probe). Hybridization patterns could be distinguished on the basis of (i) {{the presence or absence of}} cna, (ii) the size of the restriction fragment containing the cna gene, (iii) restriction fragment length polymorphisms within fnbA and fnbB, (iv) the presence of a lysogenic phage within hlb, and (v) the sizes of the restriction fragments containing the phage-bacterial DNA junction fragments. Over a period of 4 months we examined a total of 46 isolates obtained from various wards within each hospital. Among these 46 isolates, we observed a total of 4 cna patterns, 11 fnbA-fnbB patterns, and 11 hlb patterns. Southern blots with HaeIII-digested genomic DNA and a combination of all three gene probes revealed a total of 16 clearly distinguishable patterns.

Samples were taken after the previous year's field studies, which used phenol as the primary substrate, and after three successive monthly treatments of phenol plus 1, 1 -dichloroethene (1, 1 -DCE) plus TCE, phenol plus TCE, and toluene plus TCE. Dominant eubacteria in the community were assessed after each of the four treatments by characterizing isolates from the most dilute most-probable-number tubes and by extracting DNA from aquifer samples. The succession of dominant phenol- and toluene-degrading strains was evaluated by <b>genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting,</b> cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis, and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). 1, 1 -DCE was found to drastically reduce microbial growth and species richness, which corresponded to the reduction in bioremediation effectiveness noted previously for this treatment (G. D. Hopkins and P. L. McCarty, Environ. Sci. Technol. 29 : 1628 - 1637, 1995). Only a few gram-positive isolates could be obtained after treatment with 1, 1 -DCE, and these were not seen after any other treatments. Microbial densities returned to their original levels following the subsequent phenol-TCE treatment, but the original species richness was not restored until after the subsequent toluene-TCE treatment. <b>Genomic</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> and FAME analysis indicated that six of the seven originally dominant microbial groups were still dominant after the last treatment, indicating that the community is quite resilient to toxic disturbance by 1, 1 -DCE. FAME analysis indicated that six microbial taxa were dominant: three members of the (beta) subclass of the class Proteobacteria (Comamonas-Variovorax, Azoarcus, and Burkholderia) and three gram-positive groups (Bacillus, Nocardia, and an unidentified group).
