2500|$|Initially, M3 submachine guns {{returned}} for repair were not upgraded to the M3A1 standard, but merely inspected {{to ensure they}} had the improved M3 <b>housing</b> <b>assembly</b> and magazine release shield.

[...] During the conversion, armorers frequently removed the M3 cocking handle, leaving {{the rest of the}} now-redundant cocking mechanism inside the subframe. Overall, the M3A1 was seen by most soldiers and Ordnance technicians as an improvement over the M3. However, complaints of accidental discharge continued to occur even as late as the Korean War. These incidents were sometimes caused by dropping the weapon on a hard surface with an impact sufficient to knock open the ejection port cover and propel the bolt backwards (but not enough to catch the sear). [...] The return springs would then propel the bolt forward to pick up a cartridge from the magazine and carry it into the chamber, where the bolt's fixed firing pin struck the primer upon contact.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, Mystic View Task Force, a {{citizens}} group, formed {{to advocate for}} community interests in future Assembly projects. A vision emerged from the forum, of a pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development that could provide 30 additional acres of usable open space, over 30,000 diverse job, and over $30 million in new net tax revenue. Mystic View presented evidence that, developed as an office-based neighborhood with supporting retail and <b>housing,</b> <b>Assembly</b> Square could easily achieve those goals.

5000|$|The grip/trigger <b>housing</b> <b>assembly</b> is held {{in place}} with a rather fragile leaf spring clip instead of the captive pins used in other designs. The spring clip {{has been known to}} be prone to {{breakage}} since the first trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Duct tape and cable ties have been seen on M60s in the field, placed there by their crews in case the spring clip breaks. The sear in the trigger mechanism gained a reputation for wearing down, and a malfunction could cause the gun to [...] "run away". A second sear notch was eventually added to the operating rod to reduce the chance of this happening.|$|E
5000|$|Located {{at the end}} of each of {{the four}} struts (the space-only craft's [...] "wings"), are two large thrusters, one facing forward and one back. Attached to the <b>housing</b> <b>assembly</b> for these are two {{additional}} smaller attitude control thrusters. While creating the design it was envisaged that the engines would work in a similar way to those of the Harrier, in that the output could be sent to any one of the four nozzles. The smaller manoeuvring ones have about 15 to 20% of the thrust of the larger Because of the positioning of these 16 thrusters and the use of computer animation, as opposed to using miniatures and more established animation techniques such as motion control, the Starfury was able to be depicted as an incredibly agile fighter.|$|E
50|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the outer assembly serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing pin assembly, including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger <b>housing</b> <b>assembly.</b> This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, both locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the axle box wing of the axle box <b>housing</b> <b>assembly.</b> A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|E
