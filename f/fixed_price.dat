5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a <b>fixed</b> <b>price.</b> Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that HM Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Royal Bank of Scotland in a move aimed at recapitalising the Group. HM Treasury subscribed for £5billion in preference shares and underwrote the issuance of £15bn of new ordinary shares offered to RBS shareholders and new institutional shareholders at the <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> of 65.5p. As a consequence of the mismanagement which necessitated this rescue, the chief executive, Fred Goodwin (who secured the takeover of NatWest), offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Chairman Sir Tom McKillop also confirmed he would stand down from that role when his contract expired in 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously chief executive of British Land.|$|E

40|$|We study a {{class of}} single round, sealed bid auctions for items in {{unlimited}} supply such as digital goods. We focus on auctions that are stable and competitive. Stable auctions encourage bidders to bid their utility; competitive auctions yield revenue that is within a constant factor of the revenue for optimal <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing.</b> We show that for any stable auction, even a multiple-price auction, the expected revenue does not exceed that for optimal <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing.</b> We also give a bound on how far the revenue for optimal <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing</b> can be from the total market utility. We show that several randomized auctions are stable and competitive under certain assumptions, and that no stable deterministic auction is competitive. We present simulation results which confirm that our auctions compare favorably to <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing.</b> Some of our results extend to bounded supply markets, for which we also get stable and competitive auctions...|$|R

5|$|The NZ ETS covers {{forestry}} (a net sink), energy (42% {{of total}} 2012 emissions), industry (7% of total 2012 emissions) and waste (5% of total 2012 emissions) but not pastoral agriculture (46% of 2012 total emissions). Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender one emission unit (either an international 'Kyoto' unit or a New Zealand-issued unit) for every two tonnes {{of carbon dioxide}} equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> of NZ$25.The one-for-two transional measure will be phased out evenly across relevant sectors over three years from 1 January 2017. The old 50 percent surrender obligation increased to 67 percent from 1 January 2017, and will increase to 83 percent from 1 January 2018, and a full surrender obligation from 1 January 2019 for all sectors in the NZ ETS. This phased approach gives businesses time to plan and adjust, and supports a more stable market.|$|E
5|$|The menu at Pétrus {{is split}} into several <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of providers are offering utility computing services which require users to pay only when they use. Most of these providers currently charge users for metered usage based on <b>fixed</b> <b>prices.</b> In this paper, we analyze {{the pros and cons}} of charging <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> as compared to variable prices. In particular, charging <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> do not differentiate pricing based on different user requirements. Hence, we highlight the importance of deploying an autonomic pricing mechanism that self-adjusts pricing parameters to consider both application and service requirements of users. Performance results observed in the actual implementation of an enterprise Cloud show that the autonomic pricing mechanism is able to achieve higher revenue than various other common <b>fixed</b> and variable <b>pricing</b> mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{recognized}} that the General Electric case holds that a patentee may, under certain conditions, lawfully control the price the licensee of his patent may charge for the patented device, but [...] "no case of this Court has construed the patent and anti-monopoly statutes to permit separate owners of separate patents, by cross-licenses or other arrangements, to <b>fix</b> the <b>prices</b> to be charged by them and their licensees for their respective products." [...] Here, where two patentees combine their patents and <b>fix</b> <b>prices</b> on all devices produced under any of the patents, [...] "competition is impeded {{to a greater degree}} than where a single patentee <b>fixes</b> <b>prices</b> for his licensees."

40|$|La Persistance de l'Inflation dans les Modèles Néo-Keynésiens, by Mohamed Safouane Ben Aïssa and Olivier MusyWe derive the {{inflation}} dynamics {{implied by the}} different hypothesis on price adjustment existing in the New Keynesian litterature. We study the response of output and inflation in each model consecutively to a shock on {{the growth rate of}} money. We show that only two specifications can reproduce correctly the stylized facts associated with this kind of shock : the model with predetermined prices of Mankiw and Reis (2002), and the model with <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> of Gali and Gertler (1999). None of the other alternatives, including the <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> model of Fuhrer and Moore (1995), is able to reproduce correctly the delayed response of inflation. Then, when analyzing {{the inflation}} persistence implied by <b>fixed</b> <b>prices</b> models, the hypothesis on the structure of price rigidity {{is as important as the}} presence of inflation lags in the dynamics.

This is a generalization from the fact that with our approach, the global performance improves faster compared to <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing</b> in most of the tested cases. In all tested cases, our approach reached a global performance close to a method where drivers have global information of the road network status. This was not the case for the <b>fixed</b> <b>pricing</b> approach.|$|R
