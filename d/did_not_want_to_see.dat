5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him gain high office.|$|E
5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E

5|$|Gulfton {{is located}} in District 137 of the Texas House of Representatives and {{represented}} by Gene Wu since 2013. Gulfton is within District 17 of the Texas Senate and represented by Joan Huffman since 2009. In May 1991, Marc Campos of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, expressed concerns that proposed state senate redistricting plans would deliberately re-draw Texas Senate, District 15 to ensure the re-election of John Whitmire. He felt this would hamper the possible election of Hispanic representatives. Campos cited the inclusion of Gulfton in Whitmire's district would dilute Hispanic voting strength, since many Gulfton residents are not eligible to vote {{due to a lack}} of citizenship. A May 15, 1991 Houston Chronicle article reported that some people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gulfton included in a mostly Hispanic Texas Senate district citing fears that the residents might not vote. During the afternoon of May 1, 2010, 7,000 people protested Arizona's SB 1070 bill along Bellaire Boulevard and Chimney Rock in Gulfton.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' and Cameron's {{relationship}} was deteriorating and they contemplated divorce. While Cameron visited the artistic commune at San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and befriended the artist Renate Druks, Parsons {{moved into a}} house in Redondo Beach and {{was involved in a}} brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan before Cameron returned. By March 1951, Parsons and Cameron had moved to the coach house at 1071 South Orange Grove, while he began work at the Bermite Powder Company, constructing explosives for the film industry. They started holding parties once more that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the beat generation, and Cameron attended the jazz clubs of Central Avenue with her friend, the sculptor Julie Macdonald. Cameron produced illustrations for fashion magazines and sold some of her paintings, including some purchased by a friend, the artist Jirayr Zorthian. Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months. On the day before they planned to leave—June 17, 1952—he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and began work on the order at his house. In the midst of this project, an explosion destroyed the building, fatally wounding Parsons. He was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead. Cameron <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his body and retreated to San Miguel, asking her friend George Frey to oversee the cremation.|$|E

25|$|But his {{untapped}} {{talent was}} volcanic: In 1990, Johnson {{became the first}} left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan {{has said that he}} appreciated Johnson's talent and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently. In a September 27, 1992 game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.|$|E
25|$|A {{revival of}} X-Men followed, {{beginning}} with X-Men #94 (August 1975), drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont. In X-Men and Uncanny X-Men, Wolverine is initially {{overshadowed by the}} other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he is attracted to Cyclops' girlfriend, Jean Grey. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum (who preferred Nightcrawler) considered dropping Wolverine from the series; Cockrum's successor, artist John Byrne, championed the character, later explaining, as a Canadian himself, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Canadian character dropped. Byrne modeled his rendition of Wolverine on actor Paul D’Amato, who played Dr. Hook in the 1977 sports film Slap Shot. Byrne also created Alpha Flight, a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine's murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl. Cockrum had introduced a new costume for Wolverine (taken from his adversary Fang) in the final issue of his run, but it was dropped one issue into Byrne's run because he and Cockrum alike found it painfully difficult to draw.|$|E
25|$|Goichi Suda {{stated that}} he would not mind seeing Travis appear in the Super Smash Bros. series. Joystiq editor Randy Nelson agreed, stating that he would love to see Travis with his beam katana in the next title. Destructoid editor Jim Sterling {{stated that he}} would love to see Travis {{included}} just by the virtue that it is a creation of Suda's, who he is a fan of. He commented that the close relationship between Suda and Hideo Kojima, whose character Solid Snake is already in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, makes it possible that he could appear. Inc Gamers editor Tim McDonald described Travis as a good fit for the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Kombo editor David Oxford stated that while he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cast of the Super Smash Bros. series diluted by third party characters, he could easily see Travis not only fitting into the series, but being fun to play with. Escapist Magazine editor Keane Ng expressed the opinion that while the two third party characters included in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, were highly popular characters, Travis is an unlikely character due to being far less recognizable. He added that while Snake was from a Mature-rated video game, he fit in well; Travis' personality would make him too difficult to include, despite his fighting style being similar to other Smash Bros. characters. As such Travis Touchdown was not added to the final cut of the game.|$|E
