5|$|In Digitopolis, {{they meet}} the Mathemagician, {{who is still}} angry at Azaz, and who will not give his blessing to {{anything}} that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.|$|E
25|$|The {{player is}} {{returned}} to the last checkpoint <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> is captured by guards, or if he falls from too great a height. Multiple playthroughs unlock additional costumes based on previous Ueda games.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{procedure}} was performed but not followed by immersion or other requirements of the conversion procedure (e.g., in Conservative Judaism, where the mother has not converted), <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> chooses to complete the conversion at Bar Mitzvah, a Milah l'shem giur performed when the boy was an infant removes the obligation to undergo either a full brit milah or hatafat dam brit.|$|E
6000|$|Salter ventured another remonstrance: [...] "Stay {{where you}} are. How {{are you going}} to manage <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> can't tackle <b>the</b> thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really think}} you would have been sorry <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> had brought me back with a bullet in me?" [...] he said, half-questioningly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tellson saw no horses. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{were going}} to Green Lake, they could ride. Besides, the other outfit went there not long since." ...|$|R
25|$|Once the High Lamas {{have found}} {{the home and the}} boy they believe to be the reincarnation, the boy {{undergoes}} tests to ceremoniously legitimize the rebirth. They present a number of artifacts, only some of which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> chooses the items which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, this is seen as a sign, in conjunction with all of the other claimed indications, that the boy is the reincarnation.|$|E
500|$|Secret of Evermore {{takes many}} of its {{interface}} and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana. The game mostly consists of an aerial view setting, in which {{the boy and his}} dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> is currently selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence, and vice versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment, casting alchemy spells, or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game's Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0% and then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.|$|E
2500|$|The man (known as philetor, [...] "befriender") {{took the}} boy (known as kleinos, [...] "glorious") into the wilderness, where they spent two months hunting and feasting with their friends. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was {{satisfied}} with the conduct of his would-be comrade, he changed his title from kleinos to parastates ("sidekick," [...] indicating he had fought in battle alongside his lover) returned to the philetor and lived in close bonds of public intimacy with him.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were excited, <b>the</b> {{girls and}} ladies were more so. Nobody {{knew exactly what}} to do, and each minute added to the general anxiety.|$|R
60|$|The girls looked serious, but {{a little}} sly, {{as if they could}} smile <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> looked their way or <b>if</b> one of <b>the</b> old women should cough her store teeth out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As you please, Sir Guy, but {{we shall}} have the deer frightened, and the {{plantations}} cut to pieces, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> from <b>the</b> Cove are to be crossing the park.' ...|$|R
2500|$|A boy who is {{late for}} any {{division}} or other appointment {{may be required}} to sign [...] "Tardy Book", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35am and 7:45am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days). Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is summoned from his lessons to the Head Master, or Lower Master <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds. This is known as the [...] "Bill". The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or rustication (suspension). Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils might claim it as a [...] "run" [...] and absent themselves for the rest of its duration.|$|E
2500|$|Gerda is next {{found by}} the {{seashore}} where she is met by a raven, [...] "Mr. Corax" [...] (Latin for [...] "raven"). Gerda tells him that she {{is looking for a}} [...] "good, kind, brave boy". Mr. Corax tells her that such a boy is now living at the palace of a princess with whom he is [...] "palsy walsy." [...] Mr. Corax takes Gerda to the palace to find his [...] "lady friend", a female raven, named Henrietta, who knows the palace and can guide Gerda through it. They arrive at the palace {{in the midst of a}} ball with fireworks. When all are asleep, the ravens take Gerda into the palace and to the royal bedroom. Gerda takes a candle to see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> is Kay. But the boy is heavier than Kay. The shock awakens him and princess, who calls her guards. The intruders are apprehended, but when the princess is taken by the Gerda's tale of seeking her boyfriend. [...] The princess and her consort decide to help her.|$|E
2500|$|In Conservative Judaism, the Milah l'Shem giur {{procedure}} is also performed {{for a boy}} whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish. [...] This conversion of a child to Judaism without {{the conversion of the}} mother is allowed by Conservative interpretations of halakha. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the mikveh with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish. [...] If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the mikveh, or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a Bar Mitzvah, and complete the conversion then.|$|E
60|$|Clay noticed that, {{although}} his tone conveyed {{no hint of}} eagerness, his expression was resolute. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy’s</b> task was not quite congenial, he meant to undertake it, which was satisfactory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{maybe you}} did right," [...] said Frank; [...] "although the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> street <b>boys</b> {{are not to be}} trusted beyond sight. You will find out by this evening <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> word is worth anything." ...|$|R
50|$|The video ends as the {{baroness}} and the chainsaw thug {{go after}} them as the screen quickly blacks out. Unsure <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> have escaped. <b>The</b> baroness is played by Jo-Emma Larvin.|$|R
2500|$|From {{religious}} circles, same-sex love {{spread to}} the warrior (samurai) class, where it was customary for a boy in the wakashū age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The man was permitted, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a [...] "brotherhood contract", {{was expected to be}} exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers. This practice, along with clerical pederasty, developed into the codified system of age-structured homosexuality known as shudō, abbreviated from wakashūdō, the [...] "way (Tao) of wakashū". The older partner, in the role of nenja, would teach the wakashū martial skills, warrior etiquette, and the samurai code of honor, while his desire to be a good role model for his wakashū would lead him to behave more honorably himself; thus a shudō relationship was considered to have a [...] "mutually ennobling effect". In addition, both parties were expected to be loyal unto death, and to assist the other both in feudal duties and in honor-driven obligations such as duels and vendettas. Although sex between the couple was expected to end when the boy came of age, the relationship would, ideally, develop into a lifelong bond of friendship. At the same time, sexual activity with women was not barred (for either party), and once the boy came of age, both were free to seek other wakashū lovers.|$|E
60|$|Squire Paget was dumbfounded. He {{stared at}} Ralph as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was an apparition.|$|E
60|$|MRS GILBEY. Oh, dont call it {{fourteen}} days, Rob, as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> was in prison.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} useless," [...] said Maxwell, shaking his head. [...] "You have not {{realized}} these fellows' ingenuity, even yet. Further, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> saw {{what we have}} seen it might be disastrous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe he}} can cook better than I can, but he's {{primitive}} in some respects," [...] she commented. [...] "Shall {{we all have}} to use <b>the</b> same things <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> don't bring <b>the</b> cups?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{bitter cold}} out tonight, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] said Susan, coming {{in out of}} the clear starlit {{crispness}} of the Canadian winter twilight. [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> in <b>the</b> trenches are warm." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} apartment, {{and was gone}} several minutes. When he came back he raised Ralph in his strong arms as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> were a small child.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; he says <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> is {{innocent}} {{it will be}} much better to have the matter settled in court, when everybody will know he was wrongfully accused." ...|$|E
60|$|Lawrence said nothing, but, resolving that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> should attempt such another shot, {{he would}} disturb his aim, he dipped his paddle vigorously, and pushed up the river.|$|E
6000|$|It {{made him}} turn hot {{to think how}} terribly this contrasted with the {{flamboyant}} phraseology of his graduating oration. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{knew that he was}} a common hand on a ranch, and treated like a butler! ...|$|R
60|$|The captain {{turned away}} and smiled to himself. He was more than {{doubtful}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> would ever get safely over to Lake Linderman, {{the first of the}} lakes {{on the other side of}} the mountain range.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{percentage}} {{is more than}} I expected," [...] said Larry. [...] "I really didn't think I was so well up in military matters. Now, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> want me for an officer I'll take whatever they give me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} whose hat it was. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> who did {{it is willing to}} rise and tell me, it will help us to decide this question." ...|$|E
60|$|I endeavoured {{to appease}} his apprehensions, {{as he pushed}} on, wiping his brow with vexation, assuring him that, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> did mount, he would, for his own sake, ride gently.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Allah forbid it! Some men {{are strong}} in knowledge, Red Hat. Thy {{strength}} is stronger still. Keep it--I think thou wilt. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> be {{not a good}} servant, pull his ears off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} to take the risk," [...] said Grant very quietly, [...] "and {{it is a big}} responsibility; but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> got their work in and fell foul of Cheyne, we would have half the State ablaze." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{we had a}} {{very good}} time," [...] said Rollo, [...] "till we came to put our curiosities away; and then we should have had a good time <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> had not pushed so, and made such a noise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, there's no danger, Aunt Judy," [...] said Mr. Loudon, [...] "if {{you don't}} meddle with them. But I suppose you can't do that, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{are going to}} case them up, as {{they told me they}} {{intended}} doing." ...|$|R
