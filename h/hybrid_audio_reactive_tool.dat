30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a semi-blind <b>hybrid</b> <b>audio</b> {{watermarking}} algorithm {{based on the}} DWT and SVD transforms. In the proposed algorithm, the audio signal is sampled, partitioned into short audio segments called frames, and a four-level DWT decomposition is applied on each frame. A matrix is then formed by arranging the wavelet coefficients of all detail sub-bands in a unique distributed pattern which scatters the watermark bits throughout the transformed frame to provide {{a high degree of}} robustness. The SVD operator is then applied on the matrix, and the watermark bits are embedded onto the off-diagonal zero elements of the S matrix produced by the SVD transform. Unlike the other SVD-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm leaves the non-zero singular values of the S matrix unchanged to ensure high watermarking imperceptibility.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Augmented Reality (AR) shadows the {{boundaries}} between real and virtual world and brings them together. AR shifting the way community sees the world by hauling graphics away from screen display and mixes it with real environment. Most fields nowadays are driving the development of AR.

40|$|Most {{parametric}} audio coders use {{a traditional}} sinusoidal model {{to represent the}} tonal parts of audio signals, together with dedicated models for the noise and transient-like parts of the audio signal. In this paper we apply Total Least Squares (TLS) algorithms to automatically extract the modeling parameters of a Exponential Sinusoidal Model (ESM) for audio signals. This sum of exponentially damped sinusoids is capable of accurately modeling most transient segments that are readily found in audio signals. In order to turn the SNR optimization criterion of these TLS algorithms into a perceptual modeling strategy we incorporate the psychoacoustic model of MPEG 1 - Layer 1 into a subband TLS-ESM scheme. This allows us to model each subband in accordance with its perceptual relevance. Informal listening tests confirm that perceptual ESM achieves the same perceived quality as plain ESM while using substantially less components.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} specifically with {{the implementation of}} large-scale professional DMCs. The design of such multi-DSP audio products is extremely challenging: one cannot simply lash together n DSPs and obtain / 7 -times the performance of a sole device. M-P models developed here show that topology and IPC mechanisms have critical design implications. Alternative processor technologies are investigated with respect to the requirements of DMC architectures. An extensive analysis of M-P topologies is undertaken using the metrics provided by the TPG tool. Novel methods supporting DSP message-passing connectivity lead {{to the development of a}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>audio</b> M-P (HYMIPS) employing these techniques. A DMC model demonstrates the impact of task allocation on ASP M-P architectures. Five application-specific heuristics and four static-labelling schemes are developed for scheduling console taskforces on M-Ps. An integrated research framework and DCS engine enable scheduling strategies to be analysed with regard to the DMC problem domain. Three scheduling algorithms — CPM, DYN and AST — and three IPC mechanisms — FWE, NSL and NML — are investigated. Dynamic-labelling strategies and mix-bus granularity issues are further studied in detail. To summarise, this thesis elucidates those topologies, construction techniques and scheduling algorithms appropriate to professional DMC systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with linear inverse problems where the solution is assumed to have a sparse expansion with respect to several bases or frames. We were mainly motivated by the following two different approaches: (1) Jaillet and Torrésani [F. Jaillet, B. Torrésani, Time–frequency jigsaw puzzle: Adaptive multi-window and multi-layered Gabor expansions, preprint, 2005] and Molla and Torrésani [S. Molla, B. Torrésani, A <b>hybrid</b> <b>audio</b> scheme using hidden Markov models of waveforms, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal. (2005), in press] have suggested to represent audio signals by means {{of at least a}} wavelet for transient and a local cosine dictionary for tonal components. The suggested technology produces sparse representations of audio signals that are very efficient in audio coding. (2) Also quite recently, Daubechies et al. [I. Daubechies, M. Defrise, C. DeMol, An iterative thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems with a sparsity constraint, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 57 (2004) 1413 – 1541] have developed an iterative method for linear inverse problems that promote a sparse representation for the solution to be reconstructed. Here in this paper, we bring both ideas together and construct schemes for linear inverse problems where the solution might then have a sparse representation (we also allow smoothness constraints) with respect to several bases or frames. By a few numerical examples in the field of audio and image processing we show that the resulting method works quite nicely...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{evolution}} {{of modern technology}} from <b>reactive</b> <b>tool</b> to powerful and independent agent has created problems {{that are related to}} breakdowns in humanautomation coordination. These breakdowns can be explained, in part, by the fact that machines can initiate actions on their own and without explicit operator consent but do not possess the communication skills that are required to know when and how to share information with operators concerning their intentions, actions, and limitations. One problem in particular is the extensive and increasing use of automation feedback that requires focal visual attention. Such feedback does not support task-sharing and effective attention allocation, especially in the context of unexpected changes and events. One possible solution to the problem is suggested by multiple-resource theory: the distribution of tasks and information across various sensory channels. In this manuscript, we will provide an overview of our recent series of simulator studies on the effectiveness of multimodal feedback for supporting early stages of attention management. Also, some of the many remaining challenges associated with supporting more complex coordinative functions in human-machine teams will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Any system (whether in {{the area}} of finance, manufacturing, administration, etc.) that {{operates}} in a dynamic environment needs to be adaptive to changes; it should also anticipate possible adverse events to remain competitive. In our previous research in this area we experimented with one particular approach: Mapping of Task ID for Centroid-Based Adaptation with Random Immigrants (McBAR) to address problems of environmental changes for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling (RCPS) problem, especially when the latter involves changes in task numbers. However, at that time, McBAR was applied as <b>reactive</b> <b>tool</b> only. In this paper we extend McBAR approach to the RCPS problem in a proactive-reactive way. The system handles also three competing objectives: cost, makespan, and the risk of failure. We have not found any papers that deal with risk on the RCPS problem and utilize the attributes of plans from the past environmental changes. This particular aspect is incorporated in McBAR – experimental results indicate the efficiency of such approach in finding optimal solutions for a current change. In this paper we also analyze, under the effects of environmental dynamics, the variation of risk computed via McBAR and of parameters related to optimization. Further, we compare McBAR to other Evolutionary Algorithm approach in the same problem. Manuel Blanco Abello, Zbignew Michalewicz and Lam Thu Bu...|$|R
