40|$|Despite {{the huge}} upheavals in {{financial}} and industrial {{structure of the}} past decade, the European insurance markets, with the partial exception of the United Kingdom and Switzerland, have traditionally remained highly fragmented national markets. In contrast to the banking and securities sectors, they have been overprotected and have not been part of any globalization process. This may be explained partly by the specificity of the insurance business, which has historically given rise to excessively restrictive regulatory systems, and partly by the existence of cultural differences and practices, which by themselves have restricted domestic competition and made foreign penetration difficult. In view of this situation, the limited impact of the first attempt by the European Community in the 1970 s to open insurance markets through the freedom of establishment is not surprising. In recent years, however, the process of insurance market integration has been set in motion, to some extent by autonomous {{factors such as the}} blurring of frontiers in financial services and the linkages between financial sectors, but mainly {{in the context of the}} European Community’s plan to complete the internal market by the end of 1992. An important part of this ambitious project is the creation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>area,</b> with full liberalization of capital movements and the free supply o...|$|E

40|$|Phenomenal {{corporate}} collapses {{and financial}} crises have been repeated and responses urging implementation of good corporate governance (GCG) have been made, {{but why is}} there still company failure {{and why is it}} that a company which claims to have GCG still cannot achieve value maximization? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop an <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> model using an optimization approach for measuring and managing the value of companies to achieve GCG. The model uses discounted cash flow valuation model and is based on accurate and reliable accounting information so that it provides sound financial management strategies to manage the value of the company. The <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> model offers a significant contribution to the literature because it provides a managerial application model showing interactivity between individual governance variables, as well as considering external governance mechanisms. This would be of significant benefit to organizations pursuing GCG practice as well as managing their companies’ values. From an academic point of view, this research would fill the vacuum of an <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> application model which encompasses both corporate governance practices and external regulatory environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper’s aim is {{to study}} the impact of an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Financial</b> System {{implementation}} on Accountant profiles in a Swiss public administration. We observe the following variables: Accountants’ skills, Accountants’ functions, and Accountants’ educational backgrounds. Each variable was studied {{before and after the}} implementation. Design/methodology/approach – Our study is an empirical research based on a case study using interviews. We designed a questionnaire that we discussed with participants in order to determine how they perceive Accountants’ job profiles. Findings – Our main finding concerned Accountants’ educational backgrounds. In the public administration that we studied, Accountants tended overall to lack the specialized knowledge necessary to work with the complex tools in an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Financial</b> System. We also confirmed other authors’ findings, that the necessary skill sets change when an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Financial</b> System is implemented. Actually, we found that job descriptions did not change after the implementation as much as we expected they would. Research limitations/implications – Our findings are based only on participants’ perceptions, because documentation was difficult to obtain. Our small sample size also did not allow for generalizable results. Practical implications – Public administrations must carefully determine the skills necessary for the accounting staff to work within an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Financial</b> System. Job descriptions must be adapted and prospective new hires should have higher qualifications as well as better accounting and ERP knowledge. Originality/value – Our research was conducted using an ethnographic approach that compared and analysed perceptions from a diverse sample of government employees. Our sample population was chosen from among different departments and functions...|$|R
