He died in 1795, but his ideas <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> influence on three of his close friends: Juan Pío Montúfar, Juan de Dios Morales and Juan de Salinas. They, along with Manuel Rodriguez Quiroga, founded the revolutionary movement of August 10, 1809, in Quito, when the city declared independence from Spain.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated {{to be part of}} a package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although Bourdon <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes.

5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E
5|$|The genus is characterised by large, slender {{workers with}} {{elongated}} mandibles, which are narrow and triangular in shape. The mesosoma and appendages are also long. These ants {{are similar in}} appearance to Nothomyrmecia, but can be distinguished from the shape of their node. They also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> sting located in the abdomen. Two of the three species are from the Eocene while the third species is from the Late Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|While {{staying in}} Cornish in 1908, Hand began a close {{friendship}} with the political commentator and philosopher Herbert Croly. At the time, Croly was writing his influential book The Promise of American Life, in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances, including former president Theodore Roosevelt. Croly's ideas <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> effect on Roosevelt's politics, influencing his advocacy of New Nationalism {{and the development of}} Progressivism.|$|E

5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous year, 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford. The university side failed to win a single match, and despite favourable batting conditions, none of the batsmen scored a century. Palairet was second in the batting averages, scoring 276 runs at 21.23. Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet's captaincy, particularly for the University match, in which he believed a stronger team could have been chosen. Cambridge <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> team, containing eight of their players from the previous year, and adding Arthur Jones and K. S. Ranjitsinhji. Oxford lost the match by 266 runs, with only Palairet and Fry scoring more than 12 runs for the side.|$|E
5|$|On 15June1839 the {{entrepreneur}} and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built {{under the direction}} of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E

5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the {{treasury}} was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> singing and preaching style that {{influenced}} Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Prionomyrmex is an extinct genus of bulldog ants in the {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae of {{the family}} Formicidae. It was first described by Gustav Mayr in 1868, after he collected a holotype worker of P. longiceps in Baltic amber. Three species are currently described, characterised by their long mandibles, slender bodies and large size. These ants are known from the Eocene and Late Oligocene, with fossil specimens only found around Europe. It is suggested that these ants preferred to live in jungles, with one species assumed to be an arboreal nesting species. These ants <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> stinger {{that was used to}} subdue prey. In 2000, it was suggested by Cesare Baroni Urbani that the living species Nothomyrmecia macrops and a species he described both belonged to Prionomyrmex, but this proposal has not been widely accepted by the entomological community. Instead, scientists still classify the two genera distinctive from each other, making Nothomyrmecia a valid genus.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some {{semantic}} adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: {{notably the}} Imperial Diet, which—in {{contrast to the}} parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation {{on the basis of}} elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser, who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.|$|E
