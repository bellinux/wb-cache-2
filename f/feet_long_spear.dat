50|$|The length {{varied from}} around 9 <b>feet</b> <b>long,</b> {{increasing}} up to 21 feet. According to general Qi Jiguang, the Ming military categorized spears above 9 feet as short <b>spears,</b> 14 <b>feet</b> as <b>long</b> <b>spears,</b> and spears below 9 feet as spiked staffs, which were used more for hitting than stabbing. Spears used in war are typically made of hard wood. Martial arts (wushu) spears are typically made of wax wood, a lighter and more flexible wood {{better suited for}} performance; these are called flower spears.|$|R

50|$|The book {{divides the}} {{techniques}} into stabbing, cutting and striking techniques, while earlier books divided them into {{long and short}} weapon skills. The old classification method had to be abandoned {{with the development of}} firearms. The <b>long</b> <b>spear</b> had lost its function as a long-range weapon by the time the book was written. Quite clearly, first bow and arrow, and later the advent of firearms, rendered the <b>long</b> <b>spear</b> obsolete in this role.|$|R

50|$|The sarissa or sarisa (σάρισα) was a <b>long</b> <b>spear</b> or pike about 4-6 m in length. It was {{introduced}} by Philip II of Macedon and was used in his Macedonian phalanxes {{as a replacement for}} the earlier dory, which was considerably shorter. These longer spears improved the traditional strength of the phalanx by extending the rows of overlapping weapons projecting towards the enemy, and the word remained in use throughout the Byzantine years to sometimes describe the <b>long</b> <b>spears</b> of their own infantry.|$|R

40|$|In {{the battle}} array the German warriors with <b>long</b> <b>spears</b> and large shields {{stood at the}} front since their shields were of no use within the ranks. The size of the shields {{provided}} good protection against enemy weapons and therefore armor was not very necessary for the warriors. On the other hand, the lack of armor encourages the development of good coverage by a large shield. Behind the shield-bearers stood {{a large body of}} warriors armed with missiles: the Germans were armed with spears and javelins. During close combat the shield-bearers covered their throwers from enemy attack. Extending their <b>long</b> <b>spears</b> forward, they did not allow the enemy to approach closely, striking him from a distance. Large shields protected well against missiles both the shield-bearers and the throwers standing behind them. The elementary tactics of the Germans gives us the key to understanding the interaction on the battlefield of throwers and warriors armed with <b>long</b> <b>spears</b> and shields...|$|R

6000|$|In the beginning, no {{one knows}} clearly who scraped the hillsides of the hill {{rising out of the}} bare plain, and made of it a place of strength. It is written that, eleven and a half centuries ago, Bappa Rawul, the demi-god whose stature was twenty cubits, whose loin-cloth was five hundred <b>feet</b> <b>long,</b> and whose <b>spear</b> was beyond the power of mortal man to lift, took Chitor from [...] "Man Singh, the Mori Prince," [...] and wrote the first chapter of the history of Mewar, which he {{received}} ready-made from Man Singh who, if the chronicles speak sooth, was his uncle. Many and very marvellous legends cluster round the name of Bappa Rawul; and he is said to have ended his days far away from India, in Khorasan, where he married an unlimited number of the Daughters of Heth, and was the father of all the Nowshera Pathans. Some who have wandered, by the sign-posts of inscription, into the fogs of old time, aver that, two centuries before Bappa Rawul took Chitor the Mori division of the Pramar Rajputs, who are the ruling family of Mewar, had found a hold in Bhilwara, and for four centuries before that time had ruled in Kathiawar; and had royally sacked and slain, and been sacked and slain in turn. But these things are for the curious and the scholar, and not for the reader who reads lightly. Nine princes succeeded Bappa, between 728 and 1068 A.D., and among these was one Alluji, who built a Jain tower upon the brow of the hill, for in those days, though the Sun was worshipped, men were all Jains.|$|R
