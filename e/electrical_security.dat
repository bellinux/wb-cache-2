40|$|With the {{expansion}} of China's power system, {{there are more and}} more factors contributing to Large-area Power Outages. The snow disaster that hit Southern China in 2008 caused serious damages to the power systems, which made Chinese government realize that they cannot solely depend on power enterprises to effectively control the risk involved in power system. The Chinese government needs to collaborate with power enterprises in strengthening Electricity Regulation and taking countermeasures to reduce the risk of Large-area Power Outages. This paper first proposes an objective, practical and adaptive <b>Electrical</b> <b>Security</b> Risk Assessment System based on Electricity Regulation. The system consists of an assessment process with 278 indices, which are used to calculate the risk of Large-area Power Outages by the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Delphi Method. Then, an example of Guangdong power system serves to illustrate the detailed implementation procedures of the proposed assessment system and the results show that Guangdong power system faces a moderate risk of Large-area Power Outages. Finally, some countermeasures are proposed to overcome the defects in the existing power system.

As entitled in the report, major concentration {{of the study is}} based on the functional aspects and practices of the Security & Protocol department of The City Bank Ltd. Thus all the contents discussed throughout the report are to highlight on the learning‟s that was gathered during the internship period in there. When it comes about financial organizations, the foremost subjects we think regarding business earnings, profit and loss statement figures. The sole purpose of any Banking organization is to do business and increase profitability but we don‟t consider the back office support of any such organization. Security & Protocol department is one such type of support unit belonging from the back office. Banking is all about doing and bringing business and to tighten up the bonding between the Bank & customer, security department play the vital role of ensuring the safety and security of customer‟s trust and assets. Security & protocol department‟s major areas of concentration are to ensure and implement all sorts of safety measures and take preventive measures for any type of urgency. As a financial organization, risk factor comes always at first and apart from the business risk calculation it is the duty of security department to deal with other types of internal and external risk factors. Ensuring physical guarding, <b>electrical</b> <b>security</b> appliances, fire safety measures, cash carrying and nonetheless protocol support during events like AGM, EGM, Board meeting and other sorts of business events are the most common operations performed by the Security & Protocol department of The City Bank Ltd.

40|$|Condition {{assessment}} of subway stations {{is a major}} issue facing public transit authorities worldwide. In 2002, the Société de Transport de Montreal (STM) valued its subway station replacement cost at 2. 6 CAD Billions. While its stations are becoming aged, the STM requires a rehabilitation budget of 643. 6 CAD Million between the year 2006 and 2010. Nevertheless, the STM lacks a planning strategy reflecting this increase. The principal obstacle {{to the development of}} effective planning strategies is the lack of condition assessment models of subway stations. This research develops a condition assessment model, the 'Subway Station Diagnosis Index (SSDI) ', and a scale. The SSDI model is used to diagnose a specific subway station and assess its condition using an index (0 to 10). Based on the SSDI, the condition scale describes the station's condition state, its deterioration level (%), and proposed consequent actions. The new model identifies and evaluates the different functional/operational criteria for subway stations; mainly structural, architectural, mechanical, <b>electrical,</b> <b>security</b> and communications criteria. It uses specific decision analysis tools in order to evaluate a 'Functional Diagnosis Index' (FDI), and a global 'Station Diagnosis Index' (SDI). In other words, the SSDI model uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) {{in order to determine the}} criteria weights. It also utilizes the Preference Ranking Organization METHod of Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) in order to aggregate the multi-criteria. Finally, the SSDI applies the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) to determine the FDI and the SDI values. Data were collected from experts through interviews, phone calls and questionnaires as well as STM inspection reports. The targeted interviewees were transit authority experts in both Canada and U. S. A. Statistical and sensitivity analyses were performed on the collected data. Analyses show that structural and security/communication criteria are the most important (36. 1 % and 27. 3 %, respectively). The newly developed model is applied to seven stations from the STM network. Results show that these stations are deficient, with an average SDI of 4. 4 out of 10. Ranking of the seven stations is compared to that of PROMETHEE, which shows similar results. In addition, the SDI values are confirmed by STM engineers with 80 % agreement. This research is relevant to industry practitioners (management, engineers, and field inspectors) and researchers, since it develops, a multi-criteria condition assessment model and scale for subway station...|$|E

Commercial tools 1 like DIgSILENT PowerFactory [3], POWERSYS EMTP-RV [17], PSCADTM [14], Siemens PSS/E R ? [20] are just some examples. All of them very powerful but with their own proprietary format for the models created makes it hard to exchange validated mod- els of power systems. In order to disconnect the dependency of the power sys- tem model from the power system tool a project funded by the European Commission was started called “iTesla – Innovative Tools for <b>Electrical</b> System <b>Security</b> within Large Areas” [7]. One {{of the results of the}} project was the creation of a open-source modelling library called iPSL [24]. The library was created using the open-source Modelica modelling language which in turn allows to be used with several different Modelica modelling tools. The strong focus during the project was the validation of the mod- els contained in the library. Most components stem from other tools (e. g., PSAT [15], PSS/E R ? [20]).

Board level photonic integration techniques continue to improve, but photonic microsystems and fiber interfaces remain problematic, especially upon size reduction. Optical fiber is unmatched as a transmission medium for distances ranging from tens of centimeters to kilometers. The difficulty with using optical fiber is the small size of the core (approximately 9 {micro}m for the core of single mode telecommunications fiber) and the tight requirement on spot size and input numerical aperture (NA). Coupling to devices such as vertical cavity emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodetectors presents further difficulties since these elements work in a plane orthogonal to the electronics board and typically require additional optics. This leads to the need for a packaging solution that can incorporate dissimilar materials while maintaining the tight alignment tolerances required by the optics. Over the course of this LDRD project, we have examined the capabilities of components such as VCSELs and photodetectors for high-speed operation and investigated the alignment tolerances required by the optical system.

40|$|Worldwide {{concern about}} the {{environmental}} problems and a possible energy crisis has led to increasing interest in clean and renewable energy generation. Among various renewable energy sources, wind power is the most rapidly growing one. Therefore, how to provide efficient, reliable, and high-performance wind power generation and distribution has become an important and practical issue in the power industry. In addition, {{because of the new}} constraints placed by the environmental and economical factors, the trend of power system planning and operation is toward maximum utilization of the existing infrastructure with tight system operating and stability margins. This trend, together with the increased penetration of renewable energy sources, will bring new challenges to power system operation, control, stability and reliability which require innovative solutions. Flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices, through their fast, flexible, and effective control capability, provide one possible solution to these challenges. To fully utilize the capability of individual power system components, e. g., wind turbine generators (WTGs) and FACTS devices, their control systems must be suitably designed with high reliability. Moreover, in order to optimize local as well as system-wide performance and stability of the power system, real-time local and wide-area coordinated control is becoming an important issue. Power systems containing conventional synchronous generators, WTGs, and FACTS devices are large-scale, nonlinear, nonstationary, stochastic and complex systems distributed over large geographic areas. Traditional mathematical tools and system control techniques have limitations to control such complex systems to achieve an optimal performance. Intelligent and bio-inspired techniques, such as swarm intelligence, neural networks, and adaptive critic designs, are emerging as promising alternative technologies for power system control and performance optimization. This work focuses on the development of advanced optimization and intelligent control algorithms to improve the stability, reliability and dynamic performance of WTGs, FACTS devices, and the associated power networks. The proposed optimization and control algorithms are validated by simulation studies in PSCAD/EMTDC, experimental studies, or real-time implementations using Real Time Digital Simulation (RTDS) and TMS 320 C 6701 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Platform. Results show that they significantly improve <b>electrical</b> energy <b>security,</b> reliability and sustainability. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Ronald G. Harley; Committee Member: David G.
