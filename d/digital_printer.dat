50|$|Digital prints {{refers to}} images printed using a <b>digital</b> <b>printer</b> {{instead of a}} {{traditional}} printing press. These images can be printed {{to a variety of}} substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas. Accurate color reproduction and the type of ink used (see below) are key to distinguishing high quality from low quality digital prints. Metallics (silvers, golds) are particularly difficult to reproduce accurately because they reflect light back to digital scanners. High quality digital prints typically are reproduced with very high-resolution data files with very high-precision printers. The substrate used has an effect on the final colors and cannot be ignored when selecting a color palette.|$|E
40|$|In the {{printing}} process, color proofing {{is done for}} the purpose of checking the color to ensure that it is as desired, before proceeding to the plate-making process. Proofing with <b>digital</b> <b>printers</b> has grown remarkably, because of its advantages of high speed, wide color gamut, and affordable prices for a device. The accuracy of proof-press color matching is affected by the printer, software and substrate involved in digital proofing processes. Therefore, the combination of the right equipment, software and print media is the key to obtaining good proof-press color matching. The main purpose of this experimental study is to examine the color matching capability of <b>digital</b> <b>printers.</b> The color matching capability was evaluated in terms of color difference and process consistency...|$|R

50|$|You can {{distinguish}} a traditional letterpress printer from a <b>digital</b> <b>printer</b> by its debossed lettering. A traditional letterpress printer made a heavy impression into {{the stock and}} producing any indentation at all into the paper {{would have resulted in}} the print run being rejected. Part of the skill of operating a traditional letterpress printer was to get the machine pressures just right so that the type just kissed the paper transferring the minimum amount of ink to create the crispest print with no indentation. This was very important as when the print exited the machine and was stacked having too much wet ink and an indentation would have increased the risk of set-off (ink passing from the front of one sheet onto the back of the next sheet on the stack).|$|E
5000|$|In the {{packaging}} and labeling industry, Gerber’s prepress technologies impacted the printing and structural aspects, as printed packaging and labels relied largely on printing plates and screens.

[...] Additional products and technologies enabled cutting of specialty bags, {{and the production}} of coating blankets for spot UV coatings on cartons and for printing on aluminum beverage cans.

50|$|Initial {{stages of}} the {{development}} of the each episode are conceptualizing, screenwriting, traditional hand-drawing & digital character rigging. All the scripts are written by Jonas Lekganyane with ideas inspired by his daily experiences and current affairs. He then sketches the characters {{on a piece of paper}} and scans them using a <b>digital</b> <b>printer</b> into a computer. When all the characters have been digitally rigged Lekganyane uses his cousins and friends for voice overs because when he started he could not afford to hire professional voice-over artists. Lekganyane's method of animation neglects other animation steps such as story-boarding and animatics. On completion of voice-over recording, Jonas animates the final product and lip syncs it with the voice-overs. The last stages of development include sound production, editing and subtitling. To avoid paying for copyrighted music and getting slammed with lawsuits, Lekganyane also produces the music and sound effects for the series.|$|E
50|$|These {{printers}} {{are generally}} roll-to-roll {{and have a}} print bed that is 2m to 5m wide. Mostly used for printing billboards and generally have the capability of printing between 60 and 160 square metres per hour. Traditionally these were manufactured by Western manufacturers, however in the last 5 to 10 years Korean, Japanese and Chinese printer manufacturers have been aggressively competing in this category with more reliable faster printers. Margins dictate that many well-known European brands are currently manufactured in the East and simply rebranded in Europe and the United States for distribution around the world. Market antipathy to products manufactured in the East is becoming obsolescent as {{the vast majority of}} products used commercially are either assembled complete in the East or have their parts manufactured and exported from there. The low manufacturing costs of parts and machines in the East would make it extremely difficult for super-wide format <b>digital</b> <b>printer</b> suppliers around the world to compete profitably unless they turned to countries like China, Korea and Japan for their manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|The digital glass printer is a flatbed <b>digital</b> <b>printer</b> {{designed}} with print heads to jet ceramic inks {{directly onto the}} glass. The glass remains stationary while only the printer carriage sweeps across the print table. A key feature of the printer is drop fixation in which ink droplets are dried immediately to prevent drop gain. The fixation of the ink enables a single pass of the print carriage even when printing multi layer and multi color files. The drop fixation makes inline double vision printing possible. Double vision is creating a different vision depending on {{which side of the}} glass is being viewed it is achieved by printing different graphics {{one on top of the}} other.An inline dryer was developed for real time drying to occur and to maximize factory space. A smooth color switching system in included so machine operators can easily shift between print jobs and increase throughput. The high resolution print quality - up to 720 dpi - and the precision of the printers allow glass processors to print anything from fine, sharp, small elements to complex full color images on glasses up to 3.3X18 meters in size.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, digital print engines {{have made}} marked strides in {{increasing}} {{their level of}} image quality.
