5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E

25|$|Prussia {{tried to}} remain neutral while {{imposing}} tight controls on dissent, but with German nationalism sharply on the rise, the small nation blundered by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Napoleon in 1806. Its economy was weak, its leadership poor, and the once mighty Prussian army was a hollow shell. Napoleon easily crushed {{it at the}} Battle of Jena (1806). Napoleon occupied Berlin, and Prussia paid dearly. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed, and Berlin had to pay Paris heavy reparations and fund the French army of occupation. Saxony changed sides to support Napoleon and join his Confederation of the Rhine; its elector was rewarded with the title of king and given a slice of Poland taken from Prussia.|$|E
25|$|Three {{approaches}} {{attempt to}} explain the Reign of Terror imposed by the Jacobins in 1793–94. The older Marxist interpretation argued the Terror was a necessary response to outside threats (in terms of other countries <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> France) and internal threats (of traitors inside France threatening to frustrate the Revolution). In this interpretation, as expressed by the Marxist historian Albert Soboul, Robespierre and the sans-culottes were heroes for defending the revolution from its enemies. François Furet has argued that foreign threats {{had little to do}} with the terror. Instead, the extreme violence was an inherent part of the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries – their utopian goals required exterminating opposition. Soboul's Marxist interpretation has been largely abandoned by most historians since the 1990s. Hanson (2009) takes a middle position, recognising the importance of the foreign enemies, and sees the terror as a contingency that was caused by the interaction of a series of complex events and the foreign threat. Hanson says the terror was not inherent in the ideology of the Revolution, but that circumstances made it necessary.|$|E

On 9 August, Bildt compared Russia's reason for <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Georgia to Adolf Hitler's actions, [...] "No state {{has the right to}} intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state.

5000|$|Septych (from the Latin septem [...] "seven" [...] and Greek ptychē [...] "fold") is a seven panel {{piece that}} {{must be seen as}} a whole. Technically, a septych is a type of polyptych and is not unlike diptychs and triptychs, which are more common forms. Though not {{presently}} a word in common usage the visual arts use of the term and its related concept is not new. As early as the 19th century seven panel works of art were being made.

500|$|By the {{declaration}} of the American Revolution, with George Washington as its military leader, a number of dietary changes had already occurred in America. Coffee was quickly becoming the normal hot drink of the colonies and a taste for whiskey had been acquired among {{many of those who}} could produce it. In fact, in 1774, the first corn was grown in Kentucky specifically for production of American Bourbon whiskey. This step may have established this American spirit in American culture, just as the country was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> England. [...] In addition to whiskey coming into favor, a shift began in the consumption of cider over beer. Colonists opted to grow less barley as it was easier to ferment apple cider than to brew beer. Another reason for this change would have been the lack of imported hops needed to brew beer.|$|E
500|$|Morris became {{politically}} active in this period, coming {{to be associated}} with the radicalist current within British liberalism. He joined the Eastern Question Association (EQA) and was appointed the group's treasurer in November 1876. EQA had been founded by campaigners associated with the centre-left Liberal Party who opposed Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's alliance with the Ottoman Empire; the Association highlighted the Ottoman massacre of Bulgarians and feared that the alliance would lead Disraeli to join the Ottomans in <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Russian Empire. Morris took an active role in the EQA campaign, authoring the lyrics for the song [...] "Wake, London Lads!" [...] to be sung at a rally against military intervention. Morris eventually became disillusioned with the EQA, describing it as being [...] "full of wretched little personalities". He nevertheless joined a regrouping of predominantly working-class EQA activists, the National Liberal League, becoming their treasurer in summer 1879; the group remained small and politically ineffective, with Morris resigning as treasurer in late 1881, shortly before the group's collapse.|$|E

In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape.
