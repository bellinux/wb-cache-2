40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the benefits from}} vehicle <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> in urban networks. We suppose that routes can be altered {{in such a way}} as to achieve system optimal assignment. Benefits are measured by the savings in total travel time when comparing this assignment with the user equilibrium, which is assumed to occur in the absence of <b>route</b> <b>guidance.</b> A continuum approach is used to analyze an idealized corridor in which a freeway is superimposed over a dense grid of surface streets. The main role of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> is to divert traffic from the freeway whenever its marginal cost exceeds that of the street system. It is found that saving in total system travel time of the order of 3 - 4 % can be achieved from <b>route</b> <b>guidance.</b> Benefits are quite sensitive to city street speed. At low speed more users would choose the freeway resulting in congestion, and the potential benefits of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> are relatively high. However, as street speed increases and approaches that of the freeway, <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> would be of less value as more of the motorists would be choosing the city street on their own. Benefits can be enhanced if information is customized to motorists on the basis of their origins and destinations. Finally, it is shown that benefits are reduced when the freeway network is dense. This paper does not consider important aspects of the evaluation of <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> such as the equity issue stemming from increasing some trip times in order to achieve system optimum, or the local impact of diverted traffic. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTraffic signal {{control and}} <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> are {{the oldest and}} most applied dynamic traffic {{management}} measures. Most of the time they operate in a local mode, although there is trend toward network-wide traffic management. For traffic signal control already several network systems existed, but so far the integration with <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> is lacking. In this paper we describe a new strategy to integrate traffic signal control and <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> based on the principles of back-pressure control. The algorithms developed are tested in a theoretical network and it was shown that traffic signal control based on back-pressure control performs well. Using back-pressure for <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> required some assumptions which are open for debate. The results show that the average density is not such a good measure for route pressure and that travel time as a pressure variable performs better. A combination of factors of pressure based on density and travel time seems to be the best choice. Using back-pressure for both signal control and <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> gave promising results, although the differences with optimized local control were small. Future research is recommended on the fine-tuning of the back-pressure traffic signal model, and on further integration and coordination of the control strategies. On the part of <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> finding representative <b>route</b> pressure values and making the model applicable of larger networks requires more research...|$|R
