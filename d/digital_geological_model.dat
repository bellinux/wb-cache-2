40|$|A 3 D {{geological}} raster {{model has}} been constructed of the onshore of the Netherlands. The model displays geological units for the upper 500 m in 3 D in an internally consistent way. The units {{are based on the}} lithostratigraphical classification of the Netherlands. This classification is used to interpret a selection of boreholes from the national subsurface database. Additional geological information regarding faults, the areal extent of each unit and conceptual genetic models have been combined in an automated workflow to interpolate the basal surfaces of each unit on 100 × 100 metre (x,y dimensions) raster cells. The combination of all interpolated basal surfaces results in a 3 D <b>Digital</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Model</b> (DGM) of the subsurface. A measure of uncertainty of each of these surfaces is also given. The automated workflow ensures an easily updatable subsurface model. The outputs are available for end users through www. dinoloket. nl...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the structure of the Chalk in the London Basin, a combined cognitive and numerical approach to model construction was developed. A major difficultly in elucidating the structure of the Chalk in the London Basin is that the Chalk is largely unexposed. The project had to rely on subsurface data such as boreholes and site investigation reports. Although a high density of data was available problems with the distribution of data and its quality meant that, an approach based on a numerical interpolation between data points could not be used in this case. Therefore a methodology was developed that enabled the modeller to pick out areas of possible faulting and to achieve a geologically reasonable solution even in areas where the data was sparse or uncertain. By using this combined approach, the resultant 3 D model for the London Basin was more consistent with current geological observations and understanding. In essence, the methodology proposed here decreased the disparity between the <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> and current geological Knowledge. Furthermore, the analysis and interpretation of this model resulted in an improved understanding of how the London Basin evolved during the Cretaceous period. ...|$|E

The surficial component of the NATMAP proj-ect was completed in two phases for the area from 49 ° to 51 °N and from 95 ° to 98 °W. In addition to completion of associated topical investiga-tions, current emphasis is on compilation of the NATMAP outputs, and other co-operative GSC work in the area, into a synthesis. When com-bined with other MGS programs, such as the Capital Region Study, this synthesis will lead to generation of a three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> for all deposits above the Precambrian, first in the NATMAP area and then for all Phanerozoic terrane in southern Manitoba. The inputs to this model include a digital elevation model, large lake bathymetry, offshore seismic surveys, surficial geology maps, lithological data for the Quaternary from water-well and other drillhole and geophysical databases, bedrock surface elevations, bedrock maps, Phanerozoic stratigraphic data and previous Phanerozoic models, and sub-Phanerozoic Precambrian geological maps.

40|$|Borehole {{geophysical}} logs {{through the}} Chalk Group of SE England have distinctive profiles that correspond with formational boundaries, recognized by lithological changes in borehole core and mapped by the British Geological Survey {{on the basis}} of lithology and topographic features at outcrop. Borehole geophysics graphically demonstrates the validity of the stratigraphy of the Chalk Group used by the British Geological Survey, and can be used to refute recent arguments against lithostratigraphical subdivision of the White Chalk Subgroup. Although intra-formational changes in the detail of borehole geophysical logs may occur between regions, generalized trends can still be used for inter-regional recognition of formations in the subsurface. Much previous work has focused on the utility of borehole geophysics for marker-bed recognition and correlation in the Chalk Group, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the more fundamental task of characterizing formations. This approach allows a much greater appreciation of regional Chalk Group stratigraphy than might be evident from available outcrops, and is the first step in the development of three-dimensional <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>models</b> of the Chalk Group. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} firstly the combined cognitive and geostatistical modelling methodology {{that was developed}} {{in order to produce}} a structural model of the Chalk under London and secondly how the resultant model has improved our understanding of how the London Basin evolved during the Cretaceous period. A major difficultly in elucidating the structure of the Chalk in the London Basin is that the Chalk is largely unexposed. By using a combined cognitive and geostatistical approach, the resultant 3 D model for the London Basin was more consistent with current geological observations and understanding. In essence, the methodology proposed here decreased the disparity between the <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> and the geological reality. Previously, the geological structure of the London Basin was thought to be ‘relatively ’ simple, being dominated by a broad north-east trending syncline. However, 3 D modelling suggests that, in detail, the London Basin is a far more complex structure, being a collection of at least 5 fault-bounded basins. The model also indicates that the structural style of the basin changes moving north to south. This corresponds to the boundary between two structural provinces observed within the basement strata in the region (London Platform, part of the Midlands Microcraton in the north and the Variscan fold-thrust belt in the south) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Sedimentary {{aquifers}} {{are prone}} to anthropogenic disturbance. Measures aimed at mitigation or adaptation require sound information on the reactivity of soil/sediments towards the infiltrating water, as this determines the chemical quality of the groundwater and receiving surface waters. Here, we address the issues of relevant sediment properties, adequate analytical methods, borehole location selection, detail of stratification, and required sample size, to develop a protocol for efficient characterization of subsurface reactivity on a regional scale. Materials and methods The sequence of geological formations in the Dutch part of the North Sea Basin is documented {{in the form of}} systematic descriptions of some 450, 000 borings. The basic data are stored in a database that also includes a limited amount of geochemical data collected for specific research projects. Based on the borehole descriptions, a <b>Digital</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Model</b> of the Netherlands (DGM) has recently been completed. We combined the results of a statistical analysis of the existing geochemical data with theoretical and practical considerations, to assess the degree of variability of subsurface reactivity, the relevance of different DGM-based stratifications, and the efficiency and possible redundancy of analytical parameters. Results and discussion We present two protocols for the quantitative characterization of the reactive properties of the soil and subsurface sediments of the Netherlands, down to a depth of about 30 m below surface level. As numerous strategies are already available for soil surveying, the facies-based protocol for boring and sampling is aimed at subsoil sediments. Stratification is a combination of regional, lithological, and lithostratigraphical classifications. Selection of borehole locations and sampling depths is first based on the a priori information. Given the results of the first round, additional boring, sampling and analysis are performed when necessary. The analytical protocol also applies to soil surveys. It deploys limited means to obtain the most relevant information on subsurface reactivity in view of the priority environmental issues identified. Conclusions With the progress of technologies for aquifer architecture characterization and routine chemical analysis, assessment of subsurface reactivity on a regional scale has now become feasible. Lithological stratification is essential, but regional and lithostratigraphical variability cannot be ignored. With adequate stratification, a sample size of 45 per stratum was found sufficient in most instances. The key analytes chosen appear to be statistically independent; hence, a further reduction in analytical techniques would result in serious loss of information...|$|E

40|$|Many {{geological}} survey organisations have started delivering <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>models</b> {{as part of}} their role. This article describes the British <b>Geological</b> Survey (BGS) <b>model</b> for London and the Thames Valley in southeast England. The model covers 4800 km 2 and extends to several hundred metres depth. It includes extensive spreads of Quaternary river terraces and alluvium of the Thames drainage system resting on faulted and folded Palaeogene and Cretaceous bedrock strata. The model extends {{to the base of the}} Jurassic sedimentary rocks. The baseline datasets used and the uses and limitations of the model are given. The model has been used to generate grids for the elevation of the base of the Quaternary, the thickness of Quaternary deposits, and enabled a reassessment of the subcrop distribution and faulting of the Palaeogene and Cretaceous bedrock units especially beneath the Quaternary deposits. Digital outputs from the model include representations of geological surfaces, which can be used in GIS, CAD and <b>geological</b> <b>modelling</b> software, and also graphic depictions such as a fence diagram of cross-sections through the model. The model can be viewed as a whole, and be dissected, in the BGS Lithoframe Viewer. Spatial queries of this and other BGS models, at specific points, along defined lines or at a specified depth, can be performed with the new BGS Groundhog application, which delivers template-based reports. The model should be viewed as a first version that should be improved further, and kept up to date, as new data and understanding emerges. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of fuzzy logic in a GIS framework {{is a valuable}} method to assist in mineral resource assessments (MRA) in areas where data are sparse. This study uses a <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> map, backed by a <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> data <b>model,</b> derived from published legends and reports. Together they function as a 'spatial-attribute relational data model' that provides evidence, {{in the form of}} derivative maps, to support mineral potential according to deposit model criteria. A knowledge-base is created with fuzzy membership functions linked to the classes of each derivative map that indicate favourability between geological features present in the database with those required by model criteria. A fuzzy-logic-based 'inference net', as implemented in the GIS modelling language, is used to combine spatial evidence to determine mineral resource potential for three mineral deposit sub-types: (1) MVT Pb-Zn, (2) Sedimentary Cu and (3) Sediment-Hosted Sulphides. This method is shown to be valuable for providing an 'audit trial' for the complex decision-making process associated with resource assessment; it provides a means for experimenting and testing various hypotheses and viewpoints associated with mineral deposit models, and mimics some aspect of how geologists determine mineral potential for a region using information provided in geological maps and mineral deposit model literature...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at the {{reconstruction}} of the upper Quaternary depositional architecture, below the urban area of Ferrara, in northern Italy. The study area is part of the lower alluvial plain of the Po and Reno rivers and is therefore dominate by fluvial channel sands, levee sands-silts, and interchannel depression mud. The research was focused on the reconstruction of a <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> of the sedimentary bodies buried in the first 35 m under the topographic surface. The study units accumulated through Holocene and late Pleistocene times. The research work is based on the analysis of a rich data set, derived from about 2, 000 subsurface investigations, consisting of continuous coring, penetration tests (including CPTU and SCPTU), and water wells stratigraphy. The subsurface modelling was achieved through both the conceptual interpretation of surface and subsurface information and the computerized geostatistic interpolation of digitalized data. The digital interpolation overcame the large heterogeneity of the data set into a homogeneous statistical and conceptual framework, {{through the use of a}} time and economic efficient work protocol. The research work achieved {{the reconstruction of the}} environmental evolution of the area, from the last glacial maximum time up to the present. The large climatic and eustatic fluctuations of the Quaternary largely influenced the environmental evolution and sedimentary dynamics of the area. During the last sea-level lowstand, a large body of synglacial river sands accumulated into the research area, under middle alluvial plain conditions. During phases of the eustatic rising, a thick alluvial plain body aggraded in the southern portion of the study area, fed by Apennines derived rivers, whereas non depositional condition persisted on the northern structural high. The maximum transgression was matched with the widespread sedimentation of fresh water marsh muds. During the highstand times, sands accumulated into both the Po and Reno channels, and mud into the adjacent interfluvial depressions. The research work demonstrated the great role played by the compressive deformation of this portion of the seismic active Apennines Foredeep Basin in the shaping of the depositional architecture. The sedimentary successions accumulated onto the anticline crests are much thinner than those sedimented into the syncline areas. The stratigraphic interpretation of the subsurface data can improve the geotechnical and hydrogeological work and support an improved seismic danger mitigation of an area significantly affected by the May 2012 earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|In {{its role}} as a {{national}} geological survey the British Geological Survey (BGS) has produced paper maps of Britain’s geology at a series of scales for the past 170 years. Geological maps often require another geologist to understand them fully; the surveyors’ spatial ideas, models and concepts can never be properly represented in a 2 D map output, and so, to-date, much knowledge has been lost to the science and to the users. In 1815 William Smith was already addressing the need to present the third dimension of the geology as well as the surface arrangement of units. Over time, cross-section drawing became more refined, resulting in outputs such as fence diagrams, ribbon diagrams and block diagrams to reveal the 3 D structure, while contoured surfaces were used to show the spatial position of individual horizons such as major unconformities or the thickness variations of units or sequences (isopach maps) BGS has recently captured and published national coverage of geological map data as 2 -D digital maps of Britain (DiGMapGB) at 1 : 50, 000 scale.

The report is intended primarily for GIS users of the data, especially nongeologists. First, it describes what a geological map and a <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> map are. The particular meanings of ‘accuracy’ and ‘legacy’ used {{in the context of this}} report are then explained. The ‘accuracy statement’ first issued for digital map data in 2001, is provided.

Second, the report provides basic information about the DiGMapGB datasets, notes the many users and illustrates the need to understand data accuracy for correct analysis. Third, there is background information on making geological maps, some principles of their survey and compilation, the different types of geological boundary, the selection and generalisation process, and comments on the reliability of geological interpretations. For those seeking a greater level of technical detail the accuracy of Ordnance Survey topographical base maps is then described in cartographical and positional terms and related to GPS accuracy.

The method provides for the inclusion of geological knowledge and expertise in a rigorous mathematical inversion scheme, by simply asking an expert user to evaluate different <b>geological</b> <b>models</b> visually. The potential of the tech-nique is demonstrated for a number of conceptual <b>geological</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{produced}} by the British <b>Geological</b> Survey’s <b>Digital</b> <b>Geological</b> Map of Great Britain (DiGMapGB) team {{which is responsible for}} providing <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> map data at a range of scales. It provides general information relevant to users of all scales of DiGMapGB data arranged into four main chapters. First, after an introduction, the DiGMapGB datasets are identified and the polygon and linear themes, and their availability, outlined. Secondly, technical details including the sources, data structure and the information fields attached to polygons and linear features are described together with guidance on data use. Thirdly, some geological background information is provided especially for non-geologists unfamiliar with map making and some of the basic principles of geology that relate to how the data are structured and can be used. Fourthly, copyright and licensing information together with explanations of how the datasets are identified and referred to, are provided. The main contacts in BGS are listed. This is followed by a brief glossary, references and list of web links. Six appendices provide additional notes for different DiGMapGB datasets and finally the development of <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> mapping and DiGMapGB data in BGS are summarised...|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{a single}} [...] "shared earth model" [...] {{is used for}} both purposes. More commonly, a <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> is {{constructed}} at a relatively high (fine) resolution. A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells. Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps.|$|R

Sub-plate models are estimated by using the velocity fields derived from 45, global positioning system (GPS) sites under the ITRF 97 reference frame in China. Comparisons between space geodesy and <b>geological</b> <b>models</b> are given. It is found that the Euler vector of the AFRC-EURA pair has an obvious discrepancy between space geodetic and <b>geological</b> <b>models.</b> The motion patterns of tectonic blocks in China predicted by GPS {{are consistent with those}} of geological data on the whole...|$|R

40|$|This {{report and}} {{accompanying}} 3 D <b>geological</b> <b>model</b> were produced for the Environment Agency. The report describes the Quaternary geology {{of the study}} area, from Hull {{in the south to}} Flamborough Head in the north (Figure 1), and supersedes a previous study carried out in 2008 for the Hull area. The description and spatial distribution of each geological unit is based on interpretations from a 3 D <b>geological</b> <b>model,</b> which was constructed using <b>digital</b> <b>geological</b> map data and 1398 boreholes taken from the BGS Borehole Geology database, plus borehole data supplied by the Environment Agency. The data from the EA were included in the 3 D model where they fell along lines of cross-section and were particularly useful where gaps occurred in the BGS records. The 3 D model was constructed using GSI 3 D® software and methodology (described in more detail at [URL] The 3 D model comprises 74 cross-sections (plus additional ‘helper sections), it includes 26 geological units and covers a total area of approximately 1280 km 2. A NEXTMap 100 m cell size DTM was used to cap the 3 D model, which was combined with bathymetry data of the Humber Estuary, supplied by ABP Marine Environmental Research. The 3 D model has revealed extensive sand and gravel units both beneath and within the main till sequence, plus a deep sand and gravel-filled buried channel that cuts into the Chalk bedrock in the Holderness coastal area. A morainic deposit, consisting of intermixed sand and gravel with till, in places extending down to bedrock, was identified in the previous study carried out for the Hull area. These more permeable units are likely to impact on groundwater in the area...|$|R
