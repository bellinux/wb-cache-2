5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} <b>Far</b> Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over <b>Far</b> Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to <b>Far</b> Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for <b>Far</b> Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by <b>Far</b> Cry 4 did not stray <b>far</b> away from <b>Far</b> Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to <b>Far</b> Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by <b>Far</b> Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named <b>Far</b> Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to <b>Far</b> Harbor, the role-playing elements are <b>far</b> less developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an in-depth a story-line as <b>Far</b> Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred <b>Far</b> Harbor due to this expansion being light on story.|$|E

40|$|Reliability of the Fuzzy Association Rules (<b>FARs)</b> {{extraction}} is {{a challenging}} research in knowledge discovery and data mining. Reliability {{refers to the}} trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the rules diversity. In this paper, an approach called Diverse Fuzzy Rule Base (DFRB) is proposed to extract the <b>FARs</b> which are used later {{to predict the future}} values. This approach also aims to ensure high quality and diversity of the <b>FARs.</b> This is achieved through four phases: firstly, the integration of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Multiple Support Apriori (MSapriori) algorithms are applied to extract the <b>FARs.</b> The second phase calculates the correlation values for these <b>FARs,</b> and performs an efficient orientation for filtering <b>FARs</b> as a post-processing method. In the third phase, the <b>FARs</b> diversity is maintained through the clustering of <b>FARs,</b> based on the concept of the sharing function technique used in multi-objectives optimization. After that, the best and the most diverse <b>FARs</b> are evaluated and then stored in the Knowledge Base (KB). Finally, these <b>FARs,</b> stored in the KB, are utilized within the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for prediction. Experimental results for two case {{studies have shown that the}} proposed DFRB approach predicted the future values effectively, thus, outperforming the existing work...|$|R

5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on <b>Far</b> Cry 4 began {{immediately after the}} shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to <b>Far</b> Cry 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of <b>Far</b> Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
