5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b> Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E

5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E

Two prototype actuator and clutch assemblies, in continuous vacuum life test under load at 10 to the minus 8 th power torr for more than sixteen months, have each accumulated more than 34, 000 output revolutions without anomaly, the equivalent of more than seven years of operation in a 1000 km orbit or nearly ninety-five years at synchronous altitude...|$|R

50|$|Gutierrezia sarothrae {{is among}} {{one of the}} most {{widespread}} and damaging rangeland weeds, and can displace desirable vegetation if not properly managed. This displacement may be caused by livestock grazing, drought, or fire suppression. G. sarothrae quickly invades overgrazed rangeland, as cattle often leave it untouched while overgrazing grasses. Because of this, an abundance of G. sarothrae is considered to be an indicator of rangeland deterioration. It is a fire intolerant species, and is severely harmed or killed by fire; immediately after a fire it may be completely removed from an area. However, seeds can remain viable if in the soil, often causing G. sarothrae densities to increase after a fire. This may make it necessary <b>to</b> burn at <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> intervals in order to reduce its populations.|$|R
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (<b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years)</b> survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b> Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E

40|$|Effective use of {{computers}} in education for children requires consideration of individual and developmental characteristics of users. There is limited empirical evidence, however, to guide educational programming {{when it comes to}} children and their acquisition of computing skills. This paper reports on the influence of previous experience and visual-motor coordination ability on computer mouse speed, accuracy and fluency of 221 <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> old children controlling for age and gender. Findings suggest that while speed and accuracy of mouse performance improves, as expected, with age and visual-motor proficiency, fluency appears to be influenced by task conditions and engagement. Findings are interpreted in the context of motor learning to assist in understanding the developmental pre-requisites of skilled mouse use and subsequent implications for educational programming. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In other {{conventional}} gas discharge lamps, the electrodes are the {{part with the}} shortest life, limiting the lamp lifespan severely. Since an induction lamp has no electrodes, it can have a very long service life. For induction lamp systems with a separate ballast, the service life can be as long as 100,000 hours, which is 11.4 years continuous operation. For induction lamps with integrated ballast, the lifespan is in the 15,000 to 50,000 hours range. Extremely high-quality electronic circuits are needed for the ballast to attain such a long service life. Such lamps are typically used in commercial or industrial applications. Typically operations and maintenance costs are significantly lower with induction lighting systems due to their industry average 100,000 hour life cycle and <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> warranty.|$|R

25|$|On June 16, 2013 Zerkalo Nedeli {{published}} an article of Juris Doctor Mykola Khavronyuk where he provides statistical evidences of the State Court Administration of Ukraine which show that more than often persons convicted of the same crime as Tymoshenko are usually given a conditional sentence or even completely pardoned.

40|$|Numerous econometric {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for forecasting property market performance, but limited success has been achieved in finding a reliable and consistent model to predict property market movements over a <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> timeframe. This research focuses on office rental growth forecasts and overviews many of the office rent models that have evolved over the past 20 years. A model by DiPasquale and Wheaton is selected for testing in the Brisbane office market. The adaptation of this model did not provide explanatory variables that could assist in developing a reliable, predictive model of office rental growth. In light of this result, this paper suggests a system dynamics framework that includes an econometric model based on historical data as well as user input guidance for the primary variables. The rent forecast outputs would be assessed having regard to market expectations and probability profiling undertaken for use in simulation exercises...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Football League (AFL) has {{implemented}} a draft and salary cap system for over twenty-five years and {{to justify the}} use of labour market controls a league has to establish that these help achieve its stated objectives which, {{in the case of}} the AFL, can perhaps be best defined as ladder position fluidity over a <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> period. Its expansion into a national competition, however, has created an unbalanced AFL fixture list where clubs now only play five other clubs twice each season. It is suggested that the AFL should adopt a set formula for each season's fixture list, based on the previous year’s results. The suggested formula is a 'Three and Two Ones System' where clubs are divided into three groups, and in the following season play three clubs in their group twice, and only one club from each of the other two groups...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic {{polar vortex}} {{exhibited}} widespread regions of low temperatures {{during the winter}} of 2005, resulting in significant ozone depletion by chlorine and bromine species. We show that chemical loss of column ozone (deltaO 3) and the volume of Arctic vortex air cold enough to support the existence of polar stratospheric clouds (V_PSC) both exceed levels found for any other Arctic winter during the past 40 years. Cold conditions and ozone loss in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere (e. g., between potential temperatures of 360 to 400 K) were particularly unusual compared to previous years. Measurements indicate DO 3 = 121 ± 20 DU and that deltaO 3 versus V_PSC lies along an extension of the compact, near linear relation observed for previous Arctic winters. The maximum value of V_PSC during <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> intervals exhibits a steady, monotonic increase over the past four decades, indicating that the coldest Arctic winters have become significantly colder, and hence are more conducive to ozone depletion by anthropogenic halogens...|$|R

Individual predisposition to helminthiasis for people with the same sanitation infrastructure and hygiene behavior is thought to result from differing immunocompetence, nutritional status, and genetic factors.

40|$|Three {{years ago}} we found a {{statistically}} reliable link between ConocoPhillips' (NYSE: COP) stock price {{and the difference between}} the core and headline CPI in the United States. In this article, the original relationship is revisited with new data available since 2009. The agreement between the observed monthly closing price (adjusted for dividends and splits) and that predicted from the CPI difference is confirmed. The original quantitative link is validated. In order to improve the accuracy of the COP price prediction a series of advanced models is developed. The original set of two major CPIs is extended by smaller components of the headline CPIs (e. g. the CPIs of motor fuel and housing energy) and several PPIs (e. g. the PPIs of crude oil and coal) which may be inherently related to ConocoPhillips and other energy companies. These advanced models have demonstrated much lower modeling errors with better statistical properties. The earlier reported quasi-linear trend in the CPI difference is also revisited.
