5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and track <b>idlers</b> with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the <b>idlers,</b> and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the <b>idlers</b> are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the <b>idlers</b> spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E
25|$|The {{more complex}} double {{differential}} system {{is similar to}} the controlled differential in basic concept, in that it controls the speed of the tracks by controlling the rotation of the <b>idlers.</b> However, in this case two complete differentials are used, one for each track, and the <b>idlers</b> are controlled not by a brake, but a second power shaft, the steering shaft.|$|E

25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the <b>idlers.</b> Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the <b>idlers</b> fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
25|$|Non-athletic {{activities}} also abound. Principal {{among them}} are the musical activities, centered on Leamy Hall. Regimental Band, Windjammers Drum & Bugle Corps, various pep bands, and the NiteCaps Jazz Band {{are some of the}} instrumental programs. Chapel Choirs, Glee Club, the Fairwinds all-female a cappella group, and The <b>Idlers</b> all-male sea shanty group are some of the vocal programs.|$|E
25|$|With {{the clutch}} off, so the shaft does not spin, the <b>idlers</b> {{in the two}} {{differentials}} are fixed in place. This is just like the controlled differential with the brake on. When the steering clutch is engaged, the shaft spins one of the idler sets forward and the other backward, causing one track to speed up {{and the other to}} slow down.|$|E
50|$|An <b>idler</b> gear is a {{gear wheel}} that is {{inserted}} between {{two or more}} other gear wheels. The purpose of an <b>idler</b> gear can be two-fold. Firstly, the <b>idler</b> gear will change the direction of rotation of the output shaft. Secondly, an <b>idler</b> gear can assist {{to reduce the size}} of the input/output gears whilst maintaining the spacing of the shafts.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an <b>idler</b> wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the <b>idler</b> wheel, and then from the <b>idler</b> wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller <b>idler</b> wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the <b>idler</b> wheel.|$|R
40|$|High {{incidence}} of injuries {{caused by the}} manual handling of heavy <b>idler</b> rollers {{is a major concern}} for the Australian mining industry. Consequently, major mining industry stakeholders called for the development of light weight <b>idler</b> rollers. As a result this project was designed to develop a light weight <b>idler</b> roller using pultruded continuous glass fibre, vinyl ester composite circular hollow section. Current literature on the subject highlighted the need for non-ferrous light weight <b>idler</b> rollers but offers no real solution. A rigorous test regime, including physical static and dynamic testing in conjunction with finite element analysis, was used to analyse a designed light weight composite prototype <b>idler</b> roller. The main empirical finding of the project was the possibility of producing shaftless lightweight composite <b>idler</b> rollers for use in the mining industry. The conceptual shaftless composite rollers are estimated to be 40 - 60 % lighter than traditional steel rollers. The light weight of the concept <b>idler</b> roller, combined with the possibility of manufacturing <b>idler</b> rollers that are dimensionally suitable for mining, addressed the concerns of the Australian mining industry and answered the call to develop a light weight conveyor belt <b>idler</b> roller. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the preface}} to Unto This Last (1862), Ruskin {{recommended}} that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with <b>idlers</b> compelled to toil; and pensions provided {{for the elderly and}} the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame. Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the welfare state.|$|E
25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the steering clutches {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering <b>idlers</b> of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} an {{improvement}} of <b>idler</b> beam quality in a singly resonant optical parametric oscillator (OPO), where the resonant signal {{is converted to}} the <b>idler</b> via an additional difference frequency generation (DFG) process. The two processes are phase matched simultaneously by a quasi-periodically poled nonlinear crystal. Whereas back-conversion of the signal and <b>idler</b> to the pump frequency distorts the <b>idler</b> beam in a standard OPO, in a quasi-periodic OPO the DFG process reduces the signal intensity, leading to suppression of back-conversion and, hence, improvement in <b>idler</b> beam quality.

500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy <b>idlers.</b> This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of <b>idlers</b> arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These <b>idlers</b> call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

500|$|A Royal Commission of 1905 {{reported}} that workhouses were unsuited {{to deal with}} the different categories of resident they had traditionally housed, and recommended that specialised institutions for each class of pauper should be established, in which they could be treated appropriately by properly trained staff. The [...] "deterrent" [...] workhouses were in future to be reserved for [...] "incorrigibles such as drunkards, <b>idlers</b> and tramps". The Local Government Act of 1929 gave local authorities the power to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals, although outside London few did so. The workhouse system was abolished in the UK by the same Act on 1 April 1930, but many workhouses, renamed Public Assistance Institutions, continued under the control of local county councils. Even as late as the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 there were still almost 100,000 people accommodated in the former workhouses, 5,629 of whom were children. It was not until the 1948 National Assistance Act that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses. Many of the buildings were converted into retirement homes run by the local authorities; slightly more than 50per cent of local authority accommodation for the elderly was provided in former workhouses in 1960. Camberwell workhouse (in Peckham, South London) continued until 1985 as a homeless shelter for more than 1,000 men, operated by the Department of Health and Social Security and renamed a resettlement centre. Southwell workhouse, now a museum, was used to provide temporary accommodation for mothers and children until the early 1990s.|$|E
