5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon {{the type and}} energy of the supernova, {{it could be as}} far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; it always remained close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170million.|$|E

5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', {{if he wanted to}} be a success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, and that he would need to learn to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E

Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre of operations to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary bases. For example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and West) are documented as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line {{with the principles of}} the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E

5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E
5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, {{command post}} west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 {{soldiers of the}} battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get {{up out of the}} rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, turning back to the south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August29, Omar {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240km/h (150mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500UTC on September3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall {{on the east coast}} of Taiwan near Hualien City on September4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September9.|$|E

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs {{in the area}} to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola did not contribute <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both Labyrinth and Howard the Duck. Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
