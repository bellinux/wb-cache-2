40|$|In general, many {{different}} diagrams {{can contribute to}} the signal measured in broadband four-wave mixing experiments. Care must therefore be taken when designing an experiment to be sensitive to only the desired diagram by taking advantage of phase matching, pulse timing, sequence, and the wavelengths employed. We use sub- 25 fs pulses to create and monitor vibrational wavepackets in gaseous iodine, bromine, and <b>iodine</b> <b>bromide</b> through time- and frequency-resolved femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy. We experimentally illustrate this using iodine, where the broad bandwidths of our pulses, and Boltzmann population in the lower three vibrational levels conspire to make a single diagram dominant in one spectral region of the signal spectrum. In another spectral region, however, the signal is the sum of two almost equally contributing diagrams, making it difficult to directly extract information about the molecular dynamics. We derive simple analytical expressions for the time- and frequency-resolved CARS signal to study the interplay of different diagrams. Expressions are given for all five diagrams which {{can contribute to the}} CARS signal in our case. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Weight savings {{as high as}} 80 percent {{could be}} {{achieved}} if graphite polymer composites could replace aluminum in structures such as electromagnetic interference shielding covers and grounding planes. This could result in significant cost savings, especially for the mobile electronics found in spacecraft, aircraft, automobiles, and hand-held consumer electronics. However, such composites {{had not yet been}} fabricated with conductivity sufficient to enable these applications. To address this lack, a partnership of the NASA Lewis Research Center, Manchester College, and Applied Sciences, Inc., fabricated nonmetallic composites with unprecedented electrical conductivity. For these composites, heat-treated, vapor-grown graphite fibers were selected which have a resistivity of about 80 mW-cm, more than 20 times more conductive than typical carbon fibers. These fibers were then intercalated with <b>iodine</b> <b>bromide</b> (IBr). Intercalation is the insertion of guest atoms or molecules between the carbon planes of the graphite fibers. Since the carbon planes are not highly distorted in the process, intercalation has little effect on mechanical and thermal properties. Intercalation does, however, lower the carbon fiber resistivity to less than 10 mW-cm, which is comparable to that of metal fibers. Scaleup of the reaction was required since the initial intercalation experiments would be carried out on 20 -mg quantities of fibers, and tens of grams of intercalated fibers would be needed to fabricate even small demonstration composites. The reaction was first optimized through a time and temperature study that yielded fibers with a resistivity of 8. 7 2 mW-cm when exposed to IBr vapor at 114 C for 24 hours. Stability studies indicated that the intercalated fibers rapidly lost their conductivity when exposed to temperatures as low as 40 C in air. They were not, however, susceptible to degradation by water vapor in the manner of most graphite intercalation compounds. The 1000 -fold scaleup experiments concluded that 114 C was near the optimum temperature, but that the intercalation time needed to be lengthened by a factor of 3...|$|E

40|$|The more {{numerous}} the remedies for a disease {{the less likely}} that any will prove consistently helpful. Of the many drugs recommended for hyperpiesia (essential hypertension) {{there is no agreement}} on the best to employ, and none has gained any outstanding reputation. There seems to be no authoritative statement on the comparative value of these remedies, and individual drugs have been praised without controlled clinical observations. The urge for trying new remedies in hyperpiesia is prompted by the common incidence of a con-dition which produces bizarre symptoms and determines many complications. Although for this reason treatment is a matter of great concern, it {{is not likely to be}} very successful while the cause remains unknown. This paper deals primarily with the effects of certain drugs on the blood pressure in patients with hyperpiesia, and also records our observations on the influence of changes in the blood pressure on the subjective symptoms. We are not concerned here with the advisability of reducing blood pressure in hyperpiesia, but our findings during short periods of a lowered pressure have convinced us that the presence of symptoms has little or no relation to the level of the blood pressure. The opportunity, however, of observing the results of a greatly lowered blood pressure in hyperpiesia over a long period has only been gained through the onset of cardiac infarction or heart failure, when the appearance of newer symptoms might mask the direct effects of the lowered pressure.

40|$|A {{survey of}} surface, spring and {{borehole}} waters {{associated with the}} ophiolite rocks of Cyprus shows five broad water types (1) Mg-HCO 3, (2) Na-SO 4 -Cl-HCO 3, (3) Na-Ca-Cl-SO 4 -OH-CO 3, (4) Na-Cl-SO 4 and (5) Ca-SO 4. The waters represent a progression in chemical reactivity from surface waters that evolve within a groundwater setting due to hydrolysis of the basic/ultrabasic rock as modified by CO 2 -weathering. An increase in salinity is also observed {{which is due to}} mixing with a saline end-member (modified sea-water) and dissolution of gypsum/anhydrite. In some cases, the waters have pH values greater than 11. Such high values are associated with low temperature serpentinisation reactions. The system is a net sink for CO 2. This feature is related not only to the hydrolysis of the primary minerals in the rock, but also to CaCO 3 or Ca-Mg-CO 3 solubility controls. Under hyperalkaline conditions, virtually all the carbon dioxide is lost from the water due to the sufficiently high calcium levels and carbonate buffering is then insignificant. Calcium sulphate solubility controls may also be operative when calcium and sulphate concentrations are particularly high.

Due to such advantageous properties of DSS and GG, it has been taken interest to prepare a user friendly medicated gel (designated as GG-DSS gel) adding additional ingredients:e. g. Glycerol, Thymol, Ethanol, Seabuckthorn oil, and essencial oils for the improvment of the gel's medicated values and healing properties for the curing of general skin diseases/treatment. In this study, the viscoelastic behavior of GG-DSS gels were characterized by dynamic storage (G') and loss (G") moduli and complex viscosity {{as a function of}} angular frequency. The effect of DSS concentration and temperature on these properties of GG-DSS gels was investigated. All GG-DSS gels having different amount DSS shows G' higher than G" over a wide range of angular frequency. Both moduli have the trends to increase with the increase of temperature (temperature varies from 28 °C to 50 °C), and increase with the increase of DSS concentration higher than about 10 %. In conclusion, it can be mentioned that the knowledge about the rheological properties of DSS-GG gels may be useful during the characterization of similar kinds of medicated gel. © 2016 Author(s).

5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than <b>iodine.</b> Conversely, the <b>bromide</b> ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of benzoyl peroxide in anisole at 80 ° gave 10. 8 mol% methoxyphenyl benzoate, with an ortho:para ratio of 3 : 2. The inclusion of copper(II) benzoate in acetonitrile increased the yield to about 20 mol%. The yield and isomer distribution of methoxy-phenyl benzoate varied significantly with the temperature, and depended also upon the anisole:benzoyl peroxide:copper(II) benzoate ratio, and {{were influenced by}} deuterium at the ortho-or para- position. Kinetic analysis, using galvinoxyl, showed that copper(II) benzoate slightly increased {{the rate of the}} primary homolysis of benzoyl peroxide at 60 - 75 °, but the rate was slower than in the uncatalysed decomposition at 80 - 82 °. Visible spectroscopic analysis showed that benzoylperoxide reacted with copper(II) benzoate in acetonitrileto form a new species with a maximum absorption at 388 nm(E max ~ 256 000 M - 1 cm - 1). The rate of its formation wasproportional to the concentration of benzoyl peroxide, and increased with temperature. The preformed species could not oxygenate anisole effectively. The investigation was extended to halogenated anisoles, which gave high yields of methoxyphenyl benzoate, and to the polynuclear systems, naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes. The {{thermal decomposition}} of benzoyl peroxide in anisole was investigated in the presence of other additives, such as copper(II) chloride, copper(II) <b>bromide,</b> <b>iodine,</b> N-bromosuccinimide, bromine, and tin(IV) chloride, in acetonitrile. As another method of oxygenation, the benzoyl peroxide initiated reaction of halogenated aromatic compounds with acetate ions gave results which agreed with previous literature reports. This reaction could not be extended to anisole and highly fluorinated aromatic compounds. Perbenzoic acid was found to be an ineffective reagent for oxygenation of aromatic compounds, even in the presence of additives. <p...|$|R
