5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family.

By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>family.</b> Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E

5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> weighed heavily upon him.

Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him.

Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
