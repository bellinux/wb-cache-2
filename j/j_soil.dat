40|$|Monitoring the {{population}} dynamics of a biocontrol agent in soil {{is important for}} understanding, predicting and increasing its efficacy. In this study, {{the population}} dynamics and the efficacy of a promising biocontrol agent against nematode, the fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis, were investigated in greenhouse experiments with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bioassay. To explore {{the effects of the}} fungus on nematode inoculum, soil infested with eggs or second-stage juveniles (J 2) of Heterodera glycines was used. The results showed that the quantity of H. rhossiliensis DNA based on real-time PCR decreased over time, regardless of eggs or J 2 as inoculum. The quantity of H. rhossiliensis DNA [femtogram (fg) /g soil] was highest (3. 83 +/- 1. 96 x 10 (8) fg/g soil) when the fungus was first added to soil and then decreased rapidly to 3. 24 +/- 1. 22 x 10 (7) fg/g in egg-infested soil and 7. 34 +/- 2. 94 x 10 (7) fg/g in <b>J</b> 2 -infested <b>soil</b> 17 days after planting, and then declined gradually between 17 and 59 days after planting, The data based on the bioassay showed that the percentage of J 2 parasitized by H. rhossiliensis decreased throughout the experiment in both egg- and <b>J</b> 2 -infested <b>soils.</b> H. rhossiliensis controlled H. glycines more effectively in <b>J</b> 2 -infested <b>soil</b> than in egg-infested soil.

Several researchers have proposed different laboratory techniques for obtaining the value of c r. However, the usual approach is to compare some salient features of the theoretical U r –T r relationship with the compression, δ and time, t based on the laboratory data. In this paper, rapid consolidation test procedure originally proposed by Su (<b>J</b> <b>Soil</b> Mech Found Div Am Soc Civ Eng No. 95 : Proc.

The characteristic feature of the proposed method is the identification of the steepest tangent from the δ–log t plot. The slope of steepest tangent is independent of the drain spacing ratio (n) with a value of 0. 847. This approach is rapid, and it predicts more reliable values of c r as it is less influenced by the secondary compression.

In this review, some examples are presented to show the extent and magnitude of NO(3) (-) accumulation {{in the soil}} profiles and its potential effects on contamination of ground water and surface water under dryland farming in northern China. Climatic and management factors affecting NO(3) (-) leaching are also discussed. In northern China, rainfall is relatively sparse, but the high intensity of precipitation and porous soils {{play an important role in}} the accumulation of NO(3) -N in soil and its subsequent leaching in the soil profile. There is a risk of nitrate accumulation and leaching when high rates of fertilizer N are applied to improve crop yields, and it becomes even worse when conventional land use is changed from cereal crops to vegetable crops and fruit orchards. Under such conditions, shallow ground water might be polluted by NO(3) (-). This suggests that more attention should be paid to prevent this problem by using best management practices, especially by controlling the amount of N fertilizer input, balanced fertilization, split N application, inclusion of crops with deep taproots in the rotation and minimizing summer fallow (especially tilled) frequency...|$|E

Concern over the global exchange of carbon has highlighted the need for reliable estimates of soil CO efflux (soil Fc). Appropriate methods to estimate soil Fc must be identified and adopted. In this study we used a dynamic closed chamber and infra-red gas analyzer (DCC-IRGA) to verify the use of three other methods in a boreal aspen (Populus tremu- loides) forest. The three methods were: (1) soil CO ry (a) and empirical relationship (b), (2) an automated steady-state chamber and (3) daytime estimates derived from a relationship between soil temperature and nighttime eddy correlation measures of CO fluxes above the forest understory (4 m) and overstorey 2 concentration gradients and volumetric soil moisture by both diffusion theo- 2 (39 m).

Can. <b>J.</b> <b>Soil</b> Sci. 89 : 671 - 676. Indirect subsurface drip irrigation (ISDI) {{is a method}} of increasing the irrigation water use efficiency of drip irrigation without the need to bury irrigation tubes and wet the soil surface. A major problem of ISDI is the mismatch between emitter discharge rate and water-conducting device dimension, which will result in over-filling of application water. In this paper, we propose to use the steady-state principle of Coll stant-head well permeameter (CHWP) to quantify the relationship between emitter discharge rate and water-conducting device dimension For ISDI. CHWP tests and ISDI tests were carried out in a 300 in 2 winter wheat fallow to verify its feasibility. The steady-state characteristic of these two methods was also studied using long-term infiltration. Results indicate that the equilibration time (110 min) in the ISDI tests was greater than that in the CHWP tests (30 min). The steady ponded depth in ISDI had a smaller variation than the steady water discharge rate in the CHWP. When using the steady-state principle of CHWP to design ISDI systems, there was significant linear correlation between predicted and measured ponded depth values (R(2) = 0. 8379). The soil field-saturated hydraulic conductivity calculated by these two tests was approximately equal. These results demonstrate that the steady-state principle of CHWP {{could be used to}} select appropriate irrigation systems for ISDI, and ISDI provides another technique to obtain the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity...|$|E

A full {{description of the}} particle size distribution (PSD) curve is widely used {{as a basis for}} estimating soil hydraulic properties. However, the incomplete experimental data of PSD sets (i. e., percent clay, silt, and sand) often limit its uses. In this study, an empirical model modified from the Weibull model was used to estimate the complete description PSD from clay, silt and sand fractions. Results show that the estimated distribution agrees reasonably well with the actual distribution for 168 soils samples studied within six different textures. The values of coefficients of determination, the average absolute deviation and the maximum absolute deviation were 98. 6 %, 3. 3 % and 12. 6 %, respectively. The modified model performed best for silt loam samples containing about 70 % silt content. The estimation accuracy varied with radii interval. For the estimated PSD curve, a 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm size interval was most poorly estimated and had the maximum deviation (28. 2 %), while the 0. 5 - 1 mm interval was estimated well by the modified model. The model is recommended to estimate complete soil PSD using only clay, silt and sand fractions, which can be well fitted by the Weibull model. Further studies are suggested to validate the PSD estimation by this model when applied to soils with greater variation in texture...|$|E

Calcareous organic-matter-rich Black Chernozemic soils often persist under poplar forests in Saskatchewan, not acquiring the Ae horizons and related properties more characteristic of Gray Luvisol soils. These are Rego Black Chernozems, locally termed “Wooded Calcareous” {{because of the}} occurrence of a dark, calcareous horizon (AC) at depths of 10 to 30 cm. We hypothesize that dark, calcareous horizons are former Bm horizons that have been recarbonated because of intense bio- cycling of Ca by aspen (Populus tremuloides). The comparatively small amounts of carbonate occur mainly in the fine silt and clay fractions, and are dominantly calcite, indicating secondary origin, {{in comparison to the}} carbonate minerals of the Ck horizons where both calcite and dolomite occur, the latter more common in coarse fractions. The δ 13 C values of the carbonate minerals indi- cate that virtually all the carbonate in fine fractions of the upper horizons of the Wooded Calcareous soil is pedogenic. The dom- inance of pedogenic carbonate in the Ahk and AC horizons of the Wooded Calcareous soil is consistent with a secondary enrichment, a probable result of increased biocycling of Ca where aspen grows on sites with large amounts of soluble Ca in the subsoil. High concentrations of soluble Ca 2 + and SO 2 – in the LFH of the Wooded Calcareous are consistent with increasing biocycling of these ions, from a gypsum-rich subsoil...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining soil {{physical}} properties and organic C {{is the goal}} for sustainable use of soil resources in agroecosystems. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the changes in soil structure and C pools and to quantify the availability of labile C pools. The study site was in Bengkulu Province Sumatra, Indonesia. Four common agroecosystems {{were used to determine}} soil {{physical properties}} including bulk density, porosity, and soil aggregates. Labile soil C pools examined were particulate organic C (POC), microbial biomass C (MBC) and C mineralization (C min). Farming practices significantly affected the bulk density, macro-porosity, micro-porosity, aggregate stability(AS), mean weight diameter (MWD) and aggregation ratio (AR). However, the responses from treatments depend upon the soil depth. In general, agroforestry and fallow fields provided lower bulk density, higher porosity, AS, MWD and AR compared to rubber tree plantation and grain cropping. As a general trend, the values of POC, MBC and C min decreased in the order of agroforestry > fallow field > rubber tree plantation > grain cropping. The order of labile C pools in all fields were POC > MBC > C min. Significant increases (32 – 62 %, p< 0. 05) in the soil organic C content was observed in agroforestry and fallow fields compared to rubber tree plantation and grain cropping systems at the depth of 0 – 20 cm. The highest available POC (43 to 82 %) and MBC (2 to 5 %) were found in agroforestry and fallow field. Mineralized C was about 2 % in all fields indicating similar amount of active C from soil organic matter. In conclusion, improvement in soil structure properties, TOC, POC and MBC in agroforestry andfallow fields indicates better soil C sequestration and soil quality in these agroecosystems.

40|$|Measurement of the {{apparent}} dielectric permittivity of soils (dielectric constant) is becoming a popular way of estimating soil volumetric water content. This paper focuses on the measurement of apparent permittivity in four sandy soils using; time domain reflectometry (TDR), a surface capacitance insertion probe (SCIP) and a Theta probe. Measurement of {{the apparent}} permittivity using the SCIP and Theta probe are compared with the apparent permittivity measured using the TDR. Calibration of such instrumentation has remained relatively empirical following the engineering approximation presented by Topp et al. (Topp, G. C., Davies, J. L., Anan, A. P., 1980. Electromagnetic determination of soil water content: measurements in coaxial transmission lines. Water Res. Research 16, 574 – 582.). The refractive index model proposed by Whalley (Whalley, W. R., 1993. Considerations {{on the use of}} time domain reflectometry (TDR) for measuring soil water content. <b>J.</b> <b>Soil</b> Sci. 44 (1), 1 – 9.) based on that of Birchak et al. (Birchak, J. R., Gardner, C. Z. G., Hipp, J. E., Victor, J. M., 1974. High dielectric constant microwave probes for sensing soil moisture. Proc. IEEE 62 (1), 93 – 98.) is investigated as a means of gaining some physical understanding of the relative contributions of the different dielectric components in soils. Predictions made by the model are tested against results using multiple linear regression. The predictions agree well with the observed measurements. Inter-electrode conductivity is found to contribute significantly to the apparent permittivity measured using the SCIP {{and to a lesser extent}} the TDR but not the Theta probe. Inclusion of inter-electrode conductivity in regression analysis improved results. The Theta probe was found to overestimate the apparent permittivity of the soil by ∼ 1. 5 when compared with TDR results. It is suggested that this may be the result of compaction of the soil close to the electrodes, coupled with a strong bias in the sensitivity of the probe to the region very close to the central electrode.

Forest management activities that decrease soil porosity and remove organic matter {{have been associated with}} declines in site productivity. In the northern Lake States region, research is in progress in the aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. grandidentata Michx.) forest type to determine effects of soil compaction and organic matter removal on soil {{properties and}} growth of aspen suckers, associated woody species, herbaceous vegetation, and on stand development. Four treatments: (1) total tree harvest (TTH); (2) TTH plus soil compaction (CPT); (3) TTH plus forest floor removal (FFR); and (4) TTH plus CPT + FFR were applied after winter-harvest of a 70 -yr-old aspen stand growing on a loamy sand with a site of 20. 7 m. The CPT treatment significantly increased bulk density and soil strength of the surface 30 cm of soil and neither have recovered during the 5 yr since treatment. The CPT plots had 19. 6 thousand (k) suckers ha– 1, less than half that of the TTH and FFR treatments; mean diameter (19. 4 mm) and height (271 cm) were greatest on the TTH plots. The disturbance treat- ments (CPT, FFR, and CPT + FFR) each reduced biomass of foliage, stems, and total suckers compared with the TTH treatment. Total aboveground biomass (herbs + shrubs + suckers) was less than half that of TTH plots. There were 5. 0 k saplings (suckers 3 ̆e 2. 5 cm DBH) ha– 1 on the TTH plots, but fewer than 1. 0 k ha– 1 in the other treatments. The disturbance treatments decreased 5 -yr growth of potential crop trees, delayed early stand development, and temporarily reduced stockability and site productivity of an aspen ecosystem...|$|E
