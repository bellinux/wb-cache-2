5|$|Stela 40 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} Temple 29. It has been dated to AD 468 and depicts 5th-century king K'an Chitam. He is holding up a Teotihuacan-style headdress in one hand. The sides of the {{monument}} are sculpted with depictions of his father, Siyaj Chan K'awill II, and his mother, Lady Ayiin. A lengthy hieroglyphic text on the back details his birth in 415, his promotion to a <b>junior</b> <b>rank</b> in 434 and his accession to the throne in 458, as well as a brief description of his father's reign.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively <b>junior</b> <b>rank.</b> Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a <b>junior</b> <b>rank</b> on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E

25|$|Native African troops, {{although}} widely deployed, {{were initially}} employed in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers.

25|$|Between 14 and 21 July 1951, Nichols and the 6004th {{actually}} {{managed to}} retrieve a crashed MiG-15 from behind enemy lines. The MiG-15 in question had crash-landed onto mud flats south-west of Hanch'on. The intelligence coup was considered so important that it {{was supported by a}} small multi-national fleet of South Korean, U.S., and British vessels under the command of British Rear Admiral A. K. Scott-Moncrieff. Despite his relatively <b>junior</b> <b>rank,</b> Nichols was credited with organizing the operation.|$|E
25|$|In 743, he was {{appointed}} as consultant. Shortly thereafter, when the capital was moved from Kuni near the Tachibana power base to the Shigaraki Palace, near Fujiwara holdings, Nakamaro, backed by his aunt Empress Kōmyō joined the Council of State (Daijō-kan). As head of the Office of Empress Consort (shibi chudai), {{he was in charge}} of Kōmyō's principal affairs and his political influence increased as laws issued by the office carried the same weight as imperial edicts. At the same time the power of Tachibana no Moroe, who had been backed by retired Empress Genshō until her death in 748, was in decline. Through this favoritism Nakamaro rose quickly in court rank from 4th senior lower (744) through 4th senior upper (746), 3rd junior (748), 3rd senior (749) and 2nd <b>junior</b> <b>rank</b> in 750.|$|E

500|$|Known {{originally}} as the OHA Memorial Cup, it was donated in 1919 by the Ontario Hockey Association {{in honour of}} {{the soldiers}} who died fighting for Canada in World War I. [...] In 2010, the trophy was rededicated to honour all soldiers who died for Canada in any conflict. From its donation in 1919 until 1971, the Memorial Cup was awarded via a series of playoffs to the junior hockey champion of Canada. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association moved to the current tournament format in 1972 when it divided Junior A hockey into two tiers, naming the Memorial Cup as the championship of the Major <b>Junior</b> <b>rank.</b> Sixty teams across the CHL's three member leagues are eligible {{to compete for the}} Memorial Cup, representing nine provinces and four American states.|$|E
2500|$|The {{literary}} and military examinations were administered in three stages: an initial qualifying test (chosi) administered in the provinces, a second examination (hoesi) {{conducted in the}} capital (in which the qualifying candidates were selected), and a third examination (jeonsi) {{in the presence of}} the king, in which the successful candidates were ranked in order. [...] Each stage was norm-referenced, with a set number of successful applicants. The candidate who received the highest score (jangwon) in the literary examination was given a post of the 6th junior (jong) rank. If the jangwon was already employed in a position of rank, he was raised 4 levels. The candidate with second and third highest scores were given a post of the 7th <b>junior</b> <b>rank.</b> [...] The rest were not guaranteed a post, but had to wait until one became vacant. The miscellaneous examinations had only the first two stages; their candidates were not ranked.|$|E
2500|$|Native African troops, {{although}} widely deployed {{were initially}} employed in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers. [...] As the war went on, {{an increasing number}} of native Angolans rose to positions of command, though of <b>junior</b> <b>rank.</b> In the late 1950s, after 500 years of colonial rule, not only had Portugal failed to produce any native black governor, headmaster, police inspector, or professor, it had also failed to produce a single commander of senior commissioned rank in the overseas Army. [...] Here Portuguese colonial administrators fell victim to the legacy of their own discriminatory and limited polices in education, which largely barred indigenous black Africans from an equal and adequate education until well after the outbreak of the insurgency. [...] With illiteracy rates approaching 99 per cent and almost no African enrollment in secondary schools, [...] few African candidates could qualify for Portugal's officer candidate programs; most African officers obtained their commission as the result of individual competence and valour on the battlefield.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of the term knight (chevalier) dates to this period. Before the 12th century, cniht was a term for a servant. In the 12th century, it became used of a military follower in particular. [...] Also in the 12th century, a special class of noblemen serving in cavalry developed, known as milites nobiles. [...] By {{the end of the}} 13th century, chivalry (chyualerye) was used not just in the technical sense of [...] "cavalry" [...] but for martial virtue in general. [...] It was only after 1300 that knighthood (kniȝthod, originally a term for [...] "boyhood, youth") came {{to be used as a}} <b>junior</b> <b>rank</b> of nobility. By the later 14th century, the term became romanticised for the ideal of the young nobleman seeking to prove himself in honourable exploits, the knight-errant, which among other things encompassed the pas d'armes, including the joust. [...] By the 15th century, [...] "knightly" [...] virtues were sought by the noble classes even of ranks much senior than [...] "knight". The iconic association of the [...] "knight" [...] stock-character with the joust is thus historical, but develops only at the end of the Middle Ages.|$|E
