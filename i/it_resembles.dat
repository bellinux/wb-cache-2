It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy.

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. <b>It</b> <b>resembles</b> the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that <b>it</b> <b>resembles.</b> Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, <b>it</b> <b>resembles</b> the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus {{as described in the}} Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. <b>It</b> <b>resembles</b> the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action <b>it</b> <b>resembles.</b> Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of these names. In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ciseaux retourné (returned scissor) and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of the action is described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E
5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved {{to mimic the}} {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; <b>it</b> <b>resembles</b> the wasp, but has no sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E

5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: <b>it</b> <b>resembles</b> an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonais or Cheval Ariègeois de Castillon, {{once called}} the cheval du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, {{is an ancient}} breed of small riding horse from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall <b>it</b> <b>resembles</b> (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color around the eyes and muzzle and {{on the underside of}} the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens {{may be of}} Iberian origin, as {{are most}} breeds from {{the area of the}} Pyrenees. <b>It</b> <b>resembles</b> the Norwegian Dole Gudbrandsdal and the British Fell and Dales ponies. Unlike the latter, the Mérens has never been crossed with the Friesian horse. Another theory of origin for the Mérens is based on the {{straight}} or concave facial profile (which distinguishes them from the convex-profiled Iberian horses), and asserts that they are descended from Oriental horses brought to Ariege by settlers from the east. With the isolation of their mountain homeland, the Mérens has undergone very little intermingling with foreign breeds.|$|E
