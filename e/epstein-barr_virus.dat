5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus</b> and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E
5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical diagnostics, and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>virus</b> or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred {{a very long time}} ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.|$|E

40|$|Hemophagocytic {{syndrome}} (HPS) is {{a life-threatening}} hematological disorder in immunocompromised patients. Reactive HPS is observed {{in patients with}} systemic infection, neoplasia or auto-immune diseases. It is a rare hematological disorder after renal transplantation and must be suspected when fever and pancytopenia are seen in association with viral infections. HPS is usually associated with infection with the Cytomegalovirus and <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses.</b> We report here a case of BK-virus-associated HPS...|$|R
50|$|Some viruses {{are thought}} to {{establish}} a persistent (or latent) infection without symptoms, e.g., the varicella-zoster <b>virus</b> and <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses,</b> both of the herpes family. Reactivation of an existing (dormant) viral infection has been suggested {{as a cause of}} acute Bell's palsy. Studies suggest that this new activation could be preceded by trauma, environmental factors, and metabolic or emotional disorders, thus suggesting that a host of different conditions may trigger reactivation.|$|R
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses. Some viruses, such as <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus,</b> can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy, while others, such as papillomaviruses, are established causes of cancer.|$|E
5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis viruses {{can develop}} into a chronic viral {{infection}} that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus</b> causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses {{that have been used}} as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} {{alkaline phosphatase}} immunoenzymatic staining technique {{was developed for}} the detection of antibodies against <b>Epstein-Barr</b> virus-induced <b>virus</b> capsid antigens and early antigens in cell smears. The presence of antibodies against <b>Epstein-Barr</b> virus-induced <b>virus</b> capsid antigens and early antigens was revealed by a dark blue staining of cells expressing the antigens. The alkaline phosphatase assay gave a permanent record of the reaction that could be visualized under an ordinary light microscope. The titers obtained with this assay on 91 serum samples were significantly correlated with the titers obtained with an immunofluorescence technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune status}} of 33 mothers, 17 fathers, and 14 sibs of {{children}} with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was studied with the following tests: peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation with phytohaemagglutinin, serum immunoglobulin levels, isohaemagglutinin titres, and levels of antibody to herpes simplex and <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses.</b> No significant abnormality was shown by these tests, {{with the exception of}} a lymphocytosis detected in parents at an early stage of their child's disease. The significance of these findings is discussed in the light of the concept that viral infection relates to the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. It is concluded that there is no defect of immunity in these families...|$|R
40|$|PCR in the {{diagnosis}} and management of viral infec-tions, there are no published studies adequately ad-dressing the optimum number of calibrators, the num-ber of replicates of each calibrator, and {{the frequency with which}} calibration needs to be repeated. This study was designed to address these issues. Methods: Cycle threshold data (ABI 7700) was collected from> 50 consecutive real-time PCR runs for hepatitis B and <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>viruses.</b> Our routine calibration curve made from serial 10 -fold dilutions run in duplicate was compared with alternative options, including duplicate 100 -fold dilutions, inclusion of a low-copy calibrator, and omission of the duplicate determination. Control data were used to examine the use of an average cali-bration curve made from multiple runs...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus</b> gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus</b> are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
40|$|The acyclic {{nucleoside}} phosphonate analogues (HPMPA, HPMPC, PMEA, FPMPA) show {{great promise}} {{for the treatment}} of infections with such important human pathogens as adeno, pox (vaccinia) and hepadna (hepatitis B) viruses (HPMPA), herpes (herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, cytomegalo, <b>Epstein-Barr)</b> <b>viruses</b> (HPMPC), and retro (human immunodeficiency) viruses (PMEA, FPMPA). All these compounds seem to be targeted at the viral DNA polymerase, with which they interact, as either competitive inhibitors or alternative substrates (or chain terminators), following their intracellular phosphorylation to the diphosphoryl derivatives. Of particular interest is the prolonged anti-viral action, lasting for several days or even weeks, that has been noted both in vitro and in vivo after a single administration of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{prolonged}} {{generalized lymphadenopathy}} syndrome (PGL) {{has been considered}} a prodromal condition to the Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the clinical, virological and immunological characteristics of patients who will develop AIDS are not known. We report on the immunological profile of intravenous drug abusers with or without PGL in Northeastern Italy. We found a reduction of lymphocyte-absolute numbers with reversal of the T 4 /T 8 ratio and decreased Leu- 11 b+ cells. The response to mitogens and natural killer activity are compromised in PGL patients. Neutrophil function is reduced both in drug abusers with or without lymphadenopathy. The serological investigations revealed a high prevalence of antibodies against HTLV III and the <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Five blood donors were {{identified}} whose HLA-A 2 {{is different from}} the common HLA-A 2. Their A 2 molecule (A 2. 2) had a more basic isoelectric point than normal A 2 (A 2. 1). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) restricted by HLA-A 2. 1, specific for influenza A and <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses,</b> failed to lyse virus-infected target cells with HLA-A 2. 2. Identical patterns were obtained with both viruses. CTL from four of the A 2. 2 -positive donors recognized target cells prepared from others in the group that shared only the HLA-A 2. 2 antigen. The A 2. 2 antigen from one donor seemed to be different in that target cells were not recognized by CTL from donors with the normal A 2. 1 nor with basic A 2. 2. There seems, therefore, to be heterogeneity within the HLA-A 2. 2 subtype...|$|R
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>virus,</b> which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia can {{be caused}} by {{swelling}} of the cornea due to infection by the <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>virus</b> (EBV) and can therefore present as an initial symptom of EBV mononucleosis, a disease caused by <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>virus</b> infection.|$|E

40|$|Identification of T cell epitopes {{is a vital}} {{but often}} slow and {{difficult}} step in studying the immune response to infectious agents and autoantigens. We report a spatially addressable technique for screening large numbers of T cell epitopes for both specific antigen recognition and functional activity induced. This system uses microarrays of immobilized, recombinant MHC–peptide complexes, costimulatory molecules, and cytokine-capture antibodies. The array elements act as synthetic antigen-presenting cells and specifically elicit T cell responses, including adhesion, secretion of cytokines, and modulation of surface markers. The method allows facile identification of pertinent T cell epitopes in {{a large number of}} candidates and simultaneous determination of the functional outcome of the interaction. Using this method, we have characterized the activation of human CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells responding to vaccinia, influenza, HIV- 1, and <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Immunosuppression is a {{generally}} observed phenomenon {{in patients with}} malignancies. Here we report that plasminogen activating factor (PAF) produced by human (P 3 HR- 1) and simian (B 95 - 8) lymphoid cells of malignant origin abrogates lymphocyte cytotoxicity. PAF has been purified from <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> genome carrying lymphocyte cytotoxicity. PAF has been purified from <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> genome carrying lymphoid lines by affinity chromatography using lysine-Sepharose columns. Purified PAF consistently inhibited Killer cell activity against the following targets: K- 562, EB virus superinfected Raji cells and in vitro EB virus transformed autologous B lymphocytes. Furthermore PAF also inhibited the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The results presented also indicate that PAF affects the effector lymphocytes and not the target cells. Taken together, these observations {{emphasize the importance of}} factors such as PAF, released by malignant cells, as inhibitors/modulators of immune mechanisms effective against tumour cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} events underlying <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> {{infection in}} man are considered {{in respect of}} three situations. Firstly, {{the events of the}} primary infection leading to infectious mononucleosis are described and illustrate the multiplicity of virus-cell interactions and of immunological responses involved. Secondly, possible mechan-isms to explain EB virus persistence in the virus-immune host are discussed in the light of new studies monitoring the various indices of the virus carrier state. Thirdly, the analysis of EB virus infection in immunosuppressed patients shows how a relaxation of T cell-mediated immunity alters the position of the virus-host balance. The <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> is the best known member of a particular class of genetically related herpesviruses which are found in several species of ape and of Old World monkey and which are unique in their extreme tropism for B lymphocytes. 1 Despite this limited host cell range, many aspects of the biology o...|$|R

40|$|Uracil-DNA glycosylase is the DNA {{repair enzyme}} {{responsible}} {{for the removal of}} uracil from DNA, and it is present in all organisms investigated. Here we report on the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the human uracil-DNA glycosylase. The sequences of uracil-DNA glycosylases from yeast, Escherichia coli, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and homologous genes from varicella-zoster and <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses</b> are known. It is shown in this report that the predicted amino acid sequence of the human uracil-DNA glycosylase shows a striking similarity to the other uracil-DNA glycosylases, ranging from 40. 3 to 55. 7 % identical residues. The proteins of human and bacterial origin were unexpectedly found to be most closely related, 73. 3 % similarity when conservative amino acid substitutions were included. The similarity between the different uracil-DNA glycosylase genes is confined to several discrete boxes. These findings strongly indicate that uracil-DNA glycosylases from phylogenetically distant species are highly conserved...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{induction}} of malignant lymphomas can {{be achieved}} in the cottontop tamarin by inoculation with <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus.</b> This system provides an animal model for assessing the efficacy of vaccine protection against the virus which is intended to {{reduce the incidence of}} human tumours associated with EB virus infection, namely endemic Burkitt's lymphoma nd undifferentiated nasopharyngeal c rcinoma. Cottontop tamarins have been vaccinated with the major envelope glycoprotein of EB virus, gp 340, incorporated into immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) and were thereby protected against a 100 ~ lymphomagenic dose of virus. The gp 340 iscoms are highly immunogenic, requiring only a few micrograms of immunogen to induce protective immunity and thus would be a strong candidate for further development as an EB virus vaccine for use in man. <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> is strongly implicated as one of the causative agents in the chain of events that leads to the development of two important human malignancies, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Shanmugaratnam, 1971) and endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (Burkitt, 1963).

40|$|Recombinant <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses</b> with a {{stop codon}} {{inserted}} into the nuclear protein 3 B (EBNA 3 B) open reading frame were generated by second-site homologous recombination. These mutant viruses infected and growth transformed primary B lymphocytes, resulting {{in the establishment of}} lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern hybridizations with infected cell DNA demonstrated the presence of the mutant EBNA 3 B and the absence of wild-type EBNA 3 B. Immunoblot analysis of the LCLs with affinity-purified EBNA 3 B antibodies confirmed the absence of EBNA 3 B cross-reactive protein. Virus was reactivated from two of these infected LCLs and serially passaged through primary B lymphocytes. The newly infected cells contained only the mutant recombinant virus. No difference was noted between mutant and wild-type recombinants, derived in parallel, in latent (other than EBNA 3 B) or lytic cycle-infected cell virus protein expression or in the growth of the latently infected transformed cell lines. These data indicate that the EBNA 3 B protein is not critical for primary B-lymphocyte infection, growth transformation, or lytic virus infection in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Antibodies to <b>Epstein-Barr</b> {{and other}} <b>viruses</b> in {{children}} with acute lympho-blastic leukaemia. Sixty-eight children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were tested for antibodies to <b>Epstein-Barr</b> (EB) <b>virus</b> and to other viruses. The antibody response to the test viruses in these children was unremarkable, {{with the exception of}} EB virus, where the presence of complement-fixing antibodies in children tested during the first month of their illness suggested that a higher proportion had previous experience with this virus than was the case in control children. The implications of this observation with regard to leukaemogenesis are discussed. The possibility that infectious mononucleosis might be a self-limited form of leukaemia has been raised {{on a number of occasions}} (Dameshek and Gunz, 1964).

40|$|Heroin abusers are {{frequently}} {{found to have}} abnormal liver function tests and hepatic histology. Hepatitis viruses A, B, and NANB, other drugs or drug contaminants and excessive alcohol consumption are factors thought to contribute. One hundred and sixteen heroin abusers attending a London treatment centre were studied. Sixty two (53 %) had a raised aspartate transaminase. This was not explained by current infection with hepatitis A and B, cytomegalo or <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>viruses,</b> excessive alcohol consumption (greater than 80 g/day) or concomitant drug taking. Abnormal liver function tests were as frequent in those with markers of current or past HBV infection as those without and there was evidence that both HBV infection {{and the cause of}} the abnormal liver function tests were acquired in {{the first few years of}} intravenous drug abuse. Liver biopsies from eight patients showed chronic hepatitis with a mild lobular and portal inflammatory infiltrate, fatty change and prominent sinusoidal cells.
