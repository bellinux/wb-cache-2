50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabric,</b> polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a groove, over locating pins, or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} the use of fabrics as reinforcements for cement composites. The present paper addresses the influence of the production processes, casting and pultrusion of fabric-cement composites, on the mechanical properties of the composites, fabric-matrix bond and microstructural characteristics. Bonded glass mesh fabrics, woven polyethylene fabrics and warp knitted weft insertion polypropylene fabrics were studied. Tensile, flexural and fabric-matrix bond tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. SEM observations were carried out to correlate microstructural characteristics with mechanical performance. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly identified in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points. This improved mechanical performance could be accounted for by the improved bonding, which was induced by the impregnation of the spaces between the filaments in the pultrusion process, and the lack of such effective impregnation is the casting process. However, in the epoxy <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabric</b> and the mono-filament fabric sufficient interfacial bonding could be obtained in the casting process and pultrusion did not yield a significant advantage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt present, {{the use of}} refined {{numerical}} simulation is gaining more and more importance, especially in extreme load cases where large experimental test programmes are not feasible. A validated numerical methodology can be exploited to investigate critical behaviour as a “virtual test”. According to this premise, a numerical investigation is presented in this work to study the ballistic resistance of Kevlar 29 -Epoxy fabric plates subjected to impacts of small calibre projectiles, armour piercing (AP), ball type, and a blunt shaped projectile (BSP), all with a 7. 62 mm diameter. The numerical models were developed using the explicit finite element code LS - DYNA. The composite plate is 5 mm thick, made up of 12 layers. The fabric is impregnated in Epoxy matrix, to guarantee both structural and ballistic resistance, and is a 2 D plain-weave. The mechanical properties of the projectiles’ deformable materials were modelled {{by means of the}} Johnson-Cook plasticity model, which also includes the failure criterion. The composite plate is modelled using a mixed Macro-homogenous / Meso-heterogeneous approach. In particular, the area around the impact adopts the Meso-heterogeneous modelling, in which the woven yarns and the matrix are separate parts able to interact, to increase the efficiency of the numerical methodology, allowing the modelling of the friction between the yarns, the delamination and the fibre-matrix debonding. This method needs to assign separately the mechanical properties to the fabric and the matrix as well as the damage criteria for the yarns, the matrix and the delamination. In the Macro-homogenous approach, which models the remainder of the composite plate, the yarns and the matrix are considered as a unique homogenous mean, to which equivalent orthotropic mechanical properties of the <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabric</b> are assigned. The numerical investigation mainly focuses on the residual velocity of the impacting projectiles, identifying the ballistic limit of each couple projectile-target...|$|E

(Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 127) The UK Design Council {{on the other hand}} suggests to ???Approach patenting with caution. Multinational cover is expensive and premature filing can do more harm than good??? (www. designcouncil. org. uk). Clarysse and Kiefer admit that ??????a patent suit can cost $ 10 - 15 million and drag on for several years??? (Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 93). This beckons the question what is the best IP strategy for a design-led start-up. Is a patent an effective means for start-ups to overcome competition? Clarysse, Kiefer also explain how the lack of complimentary assets can hinder an entrepreneur???s market entry, and how ???bottlenecks??? in the value chain can be by-passed through focusing on niche markets (Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 72 ff). Here Clarysse, Kiefer expand on Teece???s understanding of complimentary assets, which are thought of as the ???additional resources and capabilities needed to bring a technology product to market??? (Clarysse / Kiefer, 2011, p. 80). Back in 1986 Teece analysed how these assets can increase or limit a company???s chance to succeed in the industry. David Teece has further defined appropriability as ???the environmental factors??? that govern an innovator???s ability to capture the profits generated by an innovation. ??? (Teece, 1986, p. 287) He refers to IP {{as one of the most}} important factors in relation to appropriability. The paper proposed here seeks to discuss both appropriability and complimentary assets in order to establish a clear understanding of the differences between both, and how complimentary assets relate to a venture???s appropriability regime. This study focuses in particular on small-scale design-led start-up businesses, which have limited access to complimentary assets due to the development stage that they are in. The paper discusses the question to what extent access to exclusive IP may strengthen a company???s appropriability regime and thus compensate for the absence of various complimentary assets. In line with Grounded Theory principles as introduced by Strauss / Corbin, the applicant has conducted a range of qualitative case studies of award winning British designs including the so-called Seaboard, a novel music instrument, which uses an innovative pressure-sensitive touch interface, Cupris, a smartphone-enabled clinical device that transmits data between patients and healthcare practitioners, Yossarian Lives, a metaphor-based database search engine, Arctica, a highly sustainable ventilation system, KwickScreen, a portable, retractable, room divider that provides privacy solutions in hospitals, Squeeze, an inflatable hoodie that can be blown up to give wearers a comforting squeeze when they are feeling anxious, and Concrete Canvas, a flexible cement <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabric</b> that hardens on hydration to form a thin, durable water proof and fire proof concrete layer. Interviews with inventors of these technologies have revealed that designer-entrepreneurs commonly perceive patents and other exclusive IP as a necessary prerequisite for succeeding with their design business development. At the same time the design entrepreneurs have frequently expressed concerns about the costs involved in registering IP, and about the fact that their chances of successfully defending their patents in court may be limited due to the lack of available funds. Teece alongside others has also pointed out the ease, with which established businesses can often circumvent patents. This suggests that secrecy may be preferable over patenting as a means of securing exclusivity. However, a start-up business will always find it difficult to establish credentials, whilst sustaining secrecy about the particulars of the invention involved. How to attract equity investors, for example, if the technological details of an invention cannot be revealed? This paper will introduce an assessment chart that has been designed to map out complimentary assets, which ought to be at the focus of attention of design-led start-up businesses.

40|$|The Sonochemistry Centre at Coventry University {{is one of}} a {{group of}} organisations working on a project to develop a new {{technology}} for producing antimicrobial textiles. This technology involves the use of an ultrasonic process (sonochemical) to generate and <b>impregnate</b> <b>fabrics</b> with antibacterial metal oxide nanoparticles. The expectation is that these textiles can be produced at an affordable price for routine use in hospitals as uniforms, curtains, hospital bed sheets and linen. The aim of this PhD project was to assess the antibacterial activity of <b>fabrics</b> <b>impregnated</b> with ZnO and CuO NPs against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The testing was principally carried out according to the absorption method from ISO 20743 : 2007. Research was also extended to compare different methods of assessing antibacterial activity of textile fabrics. These included disc diffusion tests and shake flask tests in saline or nutrient broth. Overall the results from absorption tests demonstrated that both the ZnO and CuO <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed very good levels of antibacterial activity (A> 2) against the test bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). During the optimisation of lab scale process to the pilot scale, two different types of CuO fabrics were produced to test and compare the antibacterial activity. One type of <b>fabrics</b> were <b>impregnated</b> with pre-made CuO nanoparticles by a ‘throwing the stones’ technology termed TTS and the other with sonochemically formed nanoparticles (in-situ), same as the lab process. The results indicated that the <b>fabrics</b> <b>impregnated</b> with sonochemically formed NPs displayed better antibacterial activity than the pre-made NPs. Leaching of the antibacterial agents in to saline was investigated using a shake flask method. CuO and ZnO coated fabrics prepared at laboratory scale were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. It was found that leachates prepared by shaking the fabrics in saline for 3 hours showed no antibacterial activity for CuO fabrics. However, leachates from ZnO fabrics showed an excellent activity after 24 ± 3 hours against all three bacterial species. Flow cytometry (FC) was investigated as an alternative to standard agar plate count (PC) methods for the determination of viable cell numbers. There was a general agreement between the results from agar plate counts and flow cytometry except that post incubation counts were greater with FC. The higher numbers of viable cells detected with FC may have been due to the presence of viable but not culturable cells (VBNC). Viable cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy in post incubation samples in which no viable cells were detected on nutrient agar plates. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted on ZnO and CuO fabrics from the pilot scale (both in-situ and TTS) against human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) using a MTT assay to determine cell viability.

40|$|Specifics of {{technology}} of prepregs obtaining, namely, semi-finished composite materials which contain a predetermined amount of fibrous filler and a polymer matrix are analyzed. It was studied {{that they are}} obtained from impregnation {{in such a way}} that the most of the physical-chemical properties of the reinforcing material are realized, and to provide specified physical and mechanical performance properties. The main fields of the prepregs application, including aviation, space, nuclear industry, pipeline transportation, construction, wind energy, medicine, sports industry etc. are described. It is shown that provision of certain content of the polymer matrix in the impregnated filler is not less important than its uniform distribution over the cross section and length of the filler. This can be achieved by precise wringing of filler that is saturated with impregnating solution. However, the achieved effect of wringing is limited by forcing node capabilities on the one hand, and on the other ? by saturation of filler. It is shown that the required content of the polymer binder in the fibrous fillers can also be provided by precise control of the viscosity (by varying of solvent content) of impregnating solution in combination with a certain speed of passage of the filler through the impregnator (by varying a speed of drawing through). It is ascertained that in the technological processes of impregnation and drying of the fabric viscosity and amount of applied polymeric binder, the strength of the fabric tension, the temperature and duration of drying, the amount of volatiles and other parameters are tightly controlled. It is noted that in the technology of production of prepregs a key part is impregnation-drying lines. In this case, vertical type of impregnation and drying equipment, in contrast to the impregnation and drying equipment of horizontal type, allows to save production area considerably, which is an important factor. It is shown that not less important is the achievement of power saving of basic prepregs preparation process, namely, impregnation, for example by integrated using of ultrasonic. Constructive and technological features of modern impregnation-drying equipment designed to obtain prepregs by domestic, Russian, European and Chinese manufacturers are analyzed. It is established that the modern drying and impregnating lines are large and technically complex engineering systems, which are provided with modern means of automatic control, safety, etc. Therefore, these lines require entirely different technological approach to impregnation and subsequent drying of impregnated glass cloth. It is stated that the basic requirements for the operation of these lines come to the need for provision of a continuous impregnation line operation when changing a roll, to the significant reduction in the amount of volatile solvents in the impregnation composition and the continuous monitoring of the content up to explosive concentrations of solvent vapor-air mixtures in the drying cell, and to the use of polymeric binders ensuring efficient drying modes at high speeds of impregnated filler movement in the drying chamber. Based on the analysis of available information it is shown that the aerodynamic heating method and coolant circulation in the drying zones distinguishes domestic impregnation machine MPT- 3 advantageously from a number of foreign counterparts, where in a similar role synthetic oil is used, providing it with a high efficiency. Besides that, the drying chamber of impregnation machine MPT- 3 M consist of two rotary heat generators which provide independent heating and maintaining of the desired temperature of the coolant in each of the drying zones. Thus the two drying zones are used to dry the <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabric,</b> and the third (middle) zone is used for pre-drying of the fabric prior to its impregnation, thereby it is conducive for the better impregnation. The spheres of integrated using of ultrasonic for achieving energy-saving by basic technological process of prepregs producing, namely impregnation, were proposed. The developed results of ultrasonic technological bases can be used for determination of energy efficient modes and structural and technological parameters of produced in the present impregnation-drying machines. Along with that, according to the developed principles the energy savings is achieved through the actions of cumulative factors. Among them are improvement of the homogenization of the polymer matrix by ultrasonic, ultrasonic activation of the surface of the fibrous fillers for improvement of their wettability by the polymer binder, degassing of structure of fibrous filler right before impregnation, increase of the productivity of the process of impregnation and dosed application of the polymer binder by increasing the speed of a fiber-fill drawing, and a significant reduction of total time of preparation of prepregs along with improvement of properties of the final cured resin composite material...|$|E

Although individual yarns exhibit rate dependent, nonlinear elastic behavior in tension, the behavior of the fabric itself is complicated because of the interaction of the two distinct media of yarns.

5000|$|One way {{in which}} <b>fabrics</b> can be <b>impregnated</b> with ceramic {{is the process of}} electrophoretic {{deposition}} or EPD in the industry. In this process, nanoceramic particles are put into a solution in which the fabric to be infiltrated will be placed. The solution is then heated to high temperatures and the fabric is placed into the solution. Next, a current is passed through and the nano ceramic particles coat and <b>impregnate</b> the <b>fabric.</b> The pH level as well as the amount of time and amount of current can affect how well the fabric is infiltrated and how it is coated.

40|$|Healthcare workers (HCWs) uniforms {{are subject}} to {{increasing}} debate regarding the levels of bacterial contamination and the clinical significance of any pathogenic contaminants. Some information is available within the literature, however {{much of this is}} dated, and there stilI lacks a standard, reproducible sampling method for use on HCWs uniforms that could be easily implemented worldwide. During this study there was recovery of S. aureus, MRSA, and Enterococcus spp. in communal staff changing rooms, clearly demonstrating that such non-patient areas present sources for the transmission of pathogenic bacteria between wards within the hospital. It was established that current international standard methods of determining antimicrobial activity in fabrics may not provide accurate indications of the efficacy of such products under ward conditions, or dealing effectively with "wild type" agents of hospital acquired infections. These findings suggest that further work is necessary in the development and use of such fabrics. Furthermore, contact plates were optimised as a method for the sampling of used nurses scrub suits and assessing the 'in-use' effect of antimicrobial <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The main finding of this project was that scrub suits frequently became (and remained) heavily contaminated with pathogenic bacteria during ward use. MRSA was recovered from 40 % of standard nurses scrub suits, and 38 % of antimicrobial impregnated (Permagard) scrub suits. Thus, the incorporation of Permagard fabric had no observable effect on the incidence of contamination on scrub suits under ward conditions. MRSA was enumerated at 1. 65 cfus per 25 cm 2 suggesting counts of around 100 - 200 cfus per 25 cm''. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Process {{conditions}} for the impregnation of polycarbosilane preceramic polymer into SiC-based composites were investigated. Two kinds of preceramic polymer (PCP) was <b>impregnated</b> into SiC-fiber <b>fabrics</b> with different solvents of n-hexane and divinylbenzene (DVB). Both microstructural observations and mechanical tests were conducted to evaluate the impregnation. The matrix phases were particulated {{in the case of}} hexane solvents. Apparent relative density of the matrix was about 78. 8 %. The density of matrix was increased to about 96. 1 - 98. 8 % when the DVB was used; however, brittle fracture was observed during a bending test. The modulus of toughness was less than 0. 74 J/m 3. The <b>fabric</b> <b>impregnated</b> with a mixed PCP-dissolved solution showed intermediate characteristics with relative high density of filling (apparent density of ~ 96. 1 %) as well as proper bending behavior. The modulus of toughness was increased to about 5. 31 J/m 3.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{possibility}} to increase the resistance upon ballistic impact of typical Kevlar-based materials by means of silica nanofluids is investigated. Nanofluids are commonly known to have non-newtonian behavior, also indicated as shear thickening fluid (STF) property. STFs are very deformable materials in ordinary conditions (flowing like a liquid as long as no force is applied), but they turn into a very rigid solid-like material at high shear rates. The nanofluid optimization, mainly regarding its chemical and thermal stability, {{as well as the}} STF/fabric chemical coupling are crucial issues to tackle, in order to suitably exploit the STF property, i. e. to increase the fabric resistance upon impact. The present work summarizes some experimental results obtained on this subject. In particular, different kind of nanofluids realized by including several percentages of silica nanoparticles within polyethylene glycol are analyzed in terms of their morphology and rheological properties. Later on, the treatment with nanofluids of different typologies of Kevlar materials and the test panels manufacturing is described. Finally, the results of the ballistic characterization of the panels is presented and widely discussed. This latter is performed by means of an in-house built electromagnetic Coil Gun, able to explore a relatively large range of bullet velocity (up to 90 m/s) with excellent precision and high degree of test reproducibility. The preliminary results obtained in such energy range show that STF <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabrics</b> have better penetration resistance compared to neat Kevlar, without affecting the fabric flexibility and, mainly, without overweighting the whole panel. That indicates that the addition of STFs to conventional ballistic fabrics enhances the material performances, thus suggesting further investigations in order to make such nanoreinforced materials effective for ballistic applications...|$|R
40|$|Photo-chemical {{reactions}} and surface modifications of poly(ethylene terephthalate) 100 % (PET) fabrics with active monomer dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA) and benzophenone (BP) as photo-initiator using a broad-band UV lamp source were investigated. The quaternization reactions were initially optimized for homo PDMAPMA, prior to reaction on the PET grafted PDMAPMA chains. The quaternization reaction of homo PDMAPMA {{was confirmed by}} one and two dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1 D and 2 D 1 HNMR), and attenuated total reflection- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) The molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn; poly dispersity index, PDI) of homo PDMAPMA and quaternized homo PDMAPMA with C 8 H 17 Br (C 8) were analyzed by gel permeation chromatograph (GPC). The tertiary amino groups of the grafted polyDMAPMA chains {{on the surface of}} PET fabrics were subsequently quaternized with alkyl bromides of different chain lengths to establish antibacterial activity. The surface composition, structure and morphology of modified PET fabrics were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To evaluate the amount of quaternary and tertiary ammonium groups on the modified surface, PET was dyed with an acid dye (Telon Red AFG) which binds to the ammonium groups. Therefore, the color depth is a direct indicator of the amount of ammonium groups. The amount of positive charges on the surface PET was measured by polyelectrolyte titration and the nitrogen content of the PET-g-PDMAPMA and quaternized PET-g-PDMAPMA was determined. The resulting antibacterial activity of the modified PET fabrics was tested with Escherichia coli. The results of all experiments show that a photochemical modification of PET is possible using DMAPMA, benzophenone and UV light. Also, the quaternization of tertiary amino groups as well as the increase of antibacterial activity of the modified PET by the established quaternary ammonium groups were successful. Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a simple and inexpensive single step synthesis based on UV activation of mixture solution of silver nitrate and poly(methacrylic acid) which acts as stabilizer agent at pH 8. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to prove the occurrence of nanoparticles and the size distribution of the Ag nanoparticle was measured. The UV-VIS spectroscopy revealed the formation of silver NPs by exciting the typical surface plasmon absorption from the UV–Vis spectrum. The mechanism of formation of those silver nanoparticles was also discussed. The streaming potential versus pH curve was negative. Ag NPs colloid was stable at pH values more than 6 (sufficient negative charge is present). The isoelectric point has been observed at pH values of 3. 5 - 4. Silver NPs colloid showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against bacteria such as Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Deposition of silver NPs on the fabrics made from polyester 100 % (PET) and polyamide- 6 100 % (PA) surface was studied by the exhaustion method using a dyeing machine at temperature 80 °C. In order to enhance wettability, the fabrics were plasma pre-treated in air. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed presence of elemental silver on the surface of PET fibers, and silver NPs were well dispersed on the surface as indicated by SEM. The amount of silver particles loaded on the PET and PA 6 samples before and after laundering was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Additionally, the antibacterial activity of the modified fabrics was measured by quantitative and qualitative methods. After the deposition of silver nanoparticles, the fabrics showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity with regard to M. luteus and E. coli. The samples which had been pre-treated by plasma exhibited antibacterial efficacy of the <b>impregnated</b> <b>fabrics</b> with Ag NPs was maintained also after laundering.
