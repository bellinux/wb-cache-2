40|$|The {{theory of}} {{electrolyte}} solutions {{was described by}} explaining Debye–Hückel theory and deriving the Debye–Hückel equation for the mean activity coefficient.

The parameters were observed to be independent of the temperature. The Hückel equation for the osmotic coefficients of water in the studied solutions was compared to that of Pitzer model by predicting the vapor pressures up to 1 mol/kg at 25 °C. The experimental vapor pressures over the reference electrolyte solutions were calculated with the Pitzer equation for the osmotic coefficients for isopiestic data in this comparison. The simple Hückel model was found to be equally good as the Pitzer model for both hydrobromic and <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acids</b> up to 0. 5 mol/kg at 25 °C but applies also to other temperatures studied...|$|R

40|$|This work {{highlights}} {{a surprisingly}} simple and kinetically controlled highly efficient indirect method {{for the production}} of high quality reduced graphene oxide (rGO) flakes via UV irradiation of aqueous dispersions of graphene oxide (GO), in which the GO is not excited directly. While the direct photoexcitation of aqueous GO (when GO is the only light-absorbing component) takes several hours of reaction time at ambient temperature (4 h) leading only to a partial GO reduction, the addition of small amounts of isopropanol and acetone (2 % and 1 %) leads to a dramatically shortened reaction time by more than two orders of magnitude (2 min) and a very efficient and soft reduction of graphene oxide. This method avoids the formation of non-volatile species and in turn contamination of the produced rGO and {{it is based on the}} highly efficient generation of reducing carbon centered isopropanol radicals via the reaction of triplet acetone with isopropanol. While the direct photolysis of GO dispersions easily leads to degradation of the carbon lattice of GO and thus to a relatively low electric conductivity of the films of flakes, our indirect photoreduction of GO instead largely avoids the formation of defects, keeping the carbon lattice intact. Mechanisms of the direct and indirect photoreduction of GO have been elucidated and compared. Raman spectroscopy, XPS and conductivity measurements prove the efficiency of the indirect photoreduction in comparison with the state-of-the-art reduction method for GO (<b>hydriodic</b> acid/trifluoroacetic <b>acid).</b> The rapid reduction times and water solvent containing only small amounts of isopropanol and acetone may allow easy process up-scaling for technical applications and low-energy consumption...|$|R

When strong, hydrogen was evolved at the negative electrode, in definite proportion to the quantity of electricity which had passed, i.e. in the same proportion as was evolved by the same current from water; and iodine without any oxygen was evolved at the positive electrode. But when diluted, small quantities of oxygen appeared with the iodine at the anode, the proportion of hydrogen at the cathode remaining undisturbed.|$|E

Chapter 2 reports the deoxygenation of benzylic alcohols with <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> in a biphasic media. This method, using boiling <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> and red phosphorous for the deoxygenation of gluconic acid to hydrocarbons, was reported the first time by Killiani 140 years ago. We reinvestigated this method by using <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> in toluene to separate the organic molecules from the harsh acidic conditions in the aqueous phase and allow milder reaction conditions. With this method benzylic and α-carbonyl alcohols are deoxygenated successfully. Even catalytic amounts of <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> are sufficient for the deoxygenation when excess of red phosphorous is used as terminal reducing agent. In chapter 3 the synthesis of the natural products ruscozepine A and B isolated from Ruscus aculeatus L and analogous compounds is described. A known synthetic pathway for the basic benzoxepine structure was improved for the synthesis of the ruscozepines. Especially a mild procedure for the intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation is applied, because typically used procedures were not favorable. Pharmacological testing revealed a high antioxidant activity by an ORAC-fluorescein assay, while no anti-inflammatory activity was observed in an ICAM- 1 expression inhibition assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} {{protocol for}} {{the reduction of}} alcohols to hydrocarbons by using <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid,</b> first described by Kiliani more than 140 years ago, was improved to be more applicable to organic synthesis. Instead of a strongly acidic, aqueous solution, a biphasic toluene&# 8211;water reaction medium was used, which allowed the conversion of primary, secondary and tertiary benzylic alcohols, in good yields and short reaction times, into the corresponding hydrocarbons. Red phosphorous {{was used as the}} stoichiometric reducing agent. Keto, ester, amide or ether groups are tolerated, and catalytic amounts of <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 2 equiv) in the presence of 0. 6 equiv phosphorous are sufficient to achieve conversion...|$|E

And the combination of microwave radiation with oxidant (such as glacial acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) and reducer (such <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid)</b> are also used to remove sulphur efficiently.|$|E
40|$|Pigment {{production}} by Cryptococcus neoformans is virulence associated. Dopamine- and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine–melanin products were identified after acidic permanganate oxidation, alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation, or hydrolysis with <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid.</b> These data provide direct chemical {{evidence for the}} formation of eumelanin polymers by catecholamine oxidation by laccase alone followed by oxidative coupling of dihydroxyindole...|$|E

The method was modified to produce [11 C]DHTP by exchanging the 11 C-labeled reagent [11 C]methyl iodide for [11 C 2 H 3]methyl iodide. The deuterated [11 C]methyl iodide was obtained by reduction of [11 C]carbon dioxide with LiAl 2 H 4 followed by treatment with <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> at standard reaction conditions used for [11 C]methyl iodide production [11].|$|E
40|$|The Raman {{spectra of}} hydrobromic and <b>hydriodic</b> <b>acid</b> {{solutions}} of Bi(III) and Sb(III) are reported. Species, which {{are present in}} solution as the halogen to metal ratio varies, are studied. In each case the MX 6 3 - species is identified by comparison with crystal spectra. No higher ratio species were observed. However species have been tentatively identified as BiX 5 (OH 2) [...] for bismuth systems and SbX 5 [...] and [SbX 5 (OH 2) ] [...] for the antimony systems...|$|E
