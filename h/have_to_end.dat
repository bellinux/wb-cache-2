5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{expected}} value originated {{in the middle of}} the 17th century from the study of the so-called problem of points, which seeks to divide the stakes in a fair way between two players who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> their game before it's properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to Blaise Pascal by French writer and amateur mathematician Chevalier de Méré. de Méré claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to Pierre de Fermat. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.|$|E

Coverage of the meeting by the local press, including a scathing editorial in the Nashville Banner denouncing Lawson as a [...] "flannel-mouth agitator", brought Lawson's activities to the attention of Vanderbilt University where he was enrolled as a Divinity School student. When Lawson was confronted by Vanderbilt's executive committee and told he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> his involvement with the sit-ins, Lawson refused. He was immediately expelled from the university.|$|E

2500|$|After 1945 only few {{observers}} {{continued to}} see similarities.

Their preliminary studies on the origins of the fascist dictatorships and the American (reformed) democracy {{came to the conclusion that}} besides essential differences [...] "the crises led to a limited degree of convergence" [...] on the level of economic and social policy. The most important cause was the growth of state interventionism since in the face of the catastrophic economic situation both societies no longer counted on the power of the market to heal itself.|$|E

Alexander critically damages Achilles' robot, forcing him to flee for cover to an arm of Alexander's robot Athena sliced off earlier in the fight. Achilles hotwires the arm to launch its fist at Alexander, destroying his robot. Alexander emerges from the wreckage and the two battle with poles before Achilles finally convinces Alexander a match does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> with the death of a jock.

2500|$|The {{surrender}} of Japan in 1945 {{brought with it}} a new question of who should rule Hong Kong. The Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek assumed he would resume the role of controlling the whole of China. Several years earlier, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt insisted that colonialism would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> and promised Soong Mei-ling that Hong Kong would be restored to Chinese control. However the British moved quickly {{to regain control of}} Hong Kong. As soon as he heard word of the Japanese surrender, Franklin Gimson, Hong Kong's colonial secretary, left his prison camp and declared himself the territory's acting governor. A government office was set up at the Former French Mission Building in Victoria on 1 September 1945. British Rear Admiral Sir Cecil Halliday Jepson Harcourt sailed into Hong Kong on board the cruiser [...] to re-establish the British government's control over the colony. On 16 September 1945, he formally accepted the Japanese surrender from Maj.-Gen. Umekichi Okada and Vice Admiral Ruitaro Fujita at Government House.|$|E

Foulois wrote in his autobiography that he and MacArthur incurred [...] "the worst tongue-lashing I ever received in all my military service". Norman E. Borden, in Air Mail Emergency of 1934, wrote: [...] "To lessen the attacks on Roosevelt and Farley, Democratic leaders {{in both houses of}} Congress and Post Office officials placed the blame for all that had gone wrong on the shoulders of Foulois."

2500|$|In the 17th century, Racine {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} Sophocles but was more influenced by Euripides (e.g. Iphigenia at Aulis and Hippolytus were the models for his plays Iphigénie and Phèdre). Euripides' reputation {{was to take}} a beating early in the 19th century when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846 and, in them, he opined that Euripides [...] "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning," [...] a view that came to influence Friedrich Nietzsche, who however {{seems not to have}} known the Euripidean plays at all well. However literary figures such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning could study and admire the Schlegels while still appreciating Euripides as [...] "our Euripides the human" [...] (Wine of Cyprus stanza 12). [...] Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: [...] "A [...] tragedy does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> 'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment." [...] In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray {{played an important role in}} popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook which seems nearer to ours for example than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides' plays as [...] "self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display" [...] and another springs to the poet's defence in terms such as: [...] "His plays are remarkable for their range of tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical artificiality, of their construction." ...|$|E
