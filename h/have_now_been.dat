5|$|The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service {{commenced}} {{a plan in}} 2007 {{to reduce}} Brumby numbers by passive trapping in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. Over 60 Brumbies captured in the Apsley River Gorge <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> re-homed.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} was the mainland; these {{tended to be}} larger because their {{pastures}} provided richer nutrients. They came {{in a range of}} colours, most frequently dun or red. These types <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> crossbred so that there is no distinct difference.|$|E
5|$|Variations include Gropecunte, Gropecountelane, Gropecontelane, Groppecountelane and Gropekuntelane. There {{were once}} many such street names in England, but all <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> bowdlerised. In {{the city of}} York, for instance, Grapcunt Lane—grāp is the Old English word for grope—was renamed as the more {{acceptable}} Grape Lane.|$|E

5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> {{placed in a}} separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the last}} nine months I have kept silence and treated with disdain the charges of disloyalty and {{suggestions}} of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere. But I can keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained feelings of the people.|$|E

5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|However {{the track}} has now closed, and the waiting rooms <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> {{converted}} into two cottages {{and the old}} up platform has been restored. The site is now a popular tourist destination and is used for holiday accommodation. An old railway tunnel just outside the village {{is used as a}} mushroom farm. Another tunnel is still present on Nettlecombe Lane (pictured to the left) leading to the station.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
60|$|Some more ropes <b>had</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> piled {{against the}} door, {{and there was}} no fear of its being burst open. Two men were posted at the windows {{on each side of the}} cabin with swords, for weapons <b>had</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> fetched from the forecastle.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas {{and his collaborators}} obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians {{have gone on to}} prove rigorously some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> rigorously proven.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these elements {{are known to be}} asymmetric while others overlap.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the town}} was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town.|$|E
50|$|Local villagers protested to {{authorities}} but claim they were ignored. On 17 August 2009 they attacked the plant causing the managers to flee. The plant <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> closed down, {{but according to}} Western reports all coverage in the Chinese media of events <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> banned.|$|R

5|$|Over 1000 specimens, {{representing}} organisms of {{all stages}} of maturity, <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> found in the White Sea area {{at the bottom of}} fine-grained sandstone layers. The large number of specimens, the small grain-size of the sediments and the variety of circumstances in which specimens were preserved provide detailed information about Kimberella′s external form, internal anatomy, locomotion and feeding style.|$|E
5|$|Over 1000serpins <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> identified, {{including}} 36human proteins, {{as well as}} {{molecules in}} all kingdoms of life—animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea—and some viruses. In the 2000s, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin superfamily based on their evolutionary relationships. Serpins are therefore {{the largest and most}} diverse superfamily of protease inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-14 {{is covered}} by the forest that has {{overgrown}} {{the northern part of}} the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north-south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal's defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> removed to the old project camp. The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial1.|$|E

5|$|The Carl Nielsen International Competition {{commenced}} in the 1970s {{under the}} auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The First European Conference on Sustainable Cities and Towns {{took place}} in Aalborg in 1994. It adopted the Aalborg Charter, which {{provides}} a framework for the delivery of local sustainable development and calls on local authorities to engage in Local Agenda 21 processes. The Fourth European Sustainable Cities and Towns Conference, held in Aalborg in 2004, adopted the more binding Aalborg Commitments on local sustainable development. The commitments <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> signed by 650 local authorities while over 2,500 have signed the earlier Aalborg Charter.|$|E
5|$|The {{house and}} {{ancillary}} structures are listed buildings that <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>been</b> converted into private residences. The original grounds are Grade II* {{listed on the}} Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England and now include St. Brendan's Sixth Form College, sports pitches and some farmland. They are now included on the Heritage at Risk register.|$|E
