40|$|Bioresorbable phosphate-based glasses (PBG) {{have been}} {{investigated}} for varying tissue engineering applications such as fibrous reinforcement for fully resorbable PLA composite for fracture fixation. The mechanical properties of these composites {{are determined by the}} mechanical properties of phosphate glass fibre (PGF) which can be tailored by varying the chemical composition of glass. However, current phosphate glass fibre production is in lab-scale quantities and in single filament form which limits the use of these fibres as they can only be produced as non-woven random or unidirectional fibre mats. The main aim of this project was to scale-up manufacture of phosphate glass fibres and textile product for reinforcement of PLA composite. The detail objectives included novel phosphate glass formulation development, design and manufacture of multifilament PGF drawing system, multifilament PGF fabrication, textile weaving and textile reinforced PLA composite characterisation. In this study, PBGs of the system P 2 O 5 -B 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-Na 2 O-Fe 2 O 3 were investigated. In order {{to determine the effects of}} replacing P 2 O 5 with B 2 O 3 on the glass structure, thermal properties, density, degradation properties and cytocompatibility studies were carried out. The investigation revealed that the thermal properties and chemical durability of the glass were decreased when phosphate was replaced by boron, due to the increase of BO 3 units which, could increase crystallisation tendency and easily be attacked by solution. During phosphate glass fibre fabrication, single <b>filament</b> <b>fibre</b> fabrication was achieved successfully using all glass codes of glass system (48 -x) P 2 O 5 -(12 +x) B 2 O 3 - 14 CaO- 20 MgO- 1 Na 2 O- 5 Fe 2 O 3. In order to produce phosphate glass fibre, all phosphate based glasses in this study were taken into account during single <b>filament</b> <b>fibre</b> drawing trials. To assess the performance of the single filament fibres, the PGF were subjected to mechanical and degradation testing. The performance of PGF was assessed by measuring three different post-processing methods including: annealed, size (water-soluble epoxy size) coated, and size coated and heat-treated. It was found that size coating and annealing treatment of the fibre improved the chemical durability of fibres significantly, whilst heat treatment damaged the coatings on the fibre and eliminated the protection on fibre surface. Based on the success from the single <b>filament</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacture, the glasses with excellent fibre drawing performance were then used in multifilament fibre fabrication. A novel furnace design was then used as a multifilament fibre drawing system. The final multifilament fibres were produced successfully and coated with water-soluble epoxy size for fibre combination and surface protection. Final strands of multifilament fibre were rewound and combined to be fibre products such as roving (without twist) and yarns (with twist). The PLA composite reinforced by unidirectional (UD) roving or yarns were produced and investigated in vitro in terms of degradation profiles and mechanical property retention in order to evaluate the effect of fibre volume fraction and twist on the performance of composites. The flexural properties of UD composites were found to rapidly reduce in aqueous medium, and the high level of twist was also seen to reduce the flexural properties of composite. With the design and manufacture of a small inkle-type loom for hand weaving, yarns were used successfully in the small Inkle-type loom to produce narrow, plain weave textiles which, to the authors knowledge is the first time textile products of phosphate glass fibre has been produced in the world. The cytocompatibility of this textile was investigated via MG 63 cell seeding on the textile surface and characterisation of cell metabolic activity. For further study, the textile reinforced PLA composite was produced and compared with a 0 °/ 90 ° unidirectional lay-up composite as a pseudo-zero crimp textile. Due to the limitation of the hand weaving technique, a higher density of yarns laying along the longitudinal direction (load direction) demonstrated greater mechanical properties when compared to 0 °/ 90 ° composite. Retention of mechanical properties for both composites was also investigated during a degradation study and 20...|$|E

The surface energy {{is directly related to}} the thermodynamic work of adhesion and it reflects the fibre adsorption capacity and its wettability. However, natural fibres have a complex surface chemistry of numerous organic species and present physical asperities that render the surface energetically heterogeneous. Since IGC is typically performed at infinite dilution where only the higher energetic sites interact with the solvent, a single measure of surface energy is likely to be misleading as the surface energy changes with changing chemical composition.

Underground pedestrian crossings are much safer than crossings at another level, but they lose in attraction when it comes to cost. The cost of the construction of an underground pedestrian crossing often leads to project abandonment. The cost of construction can be reduced through the use of flexible corrugated metal structures instead of ordinary concrete structures. The stress-strain state of the structural shells need to be known to facilitate their rational design. The stress-strain state of flexible corrugated metal shells largely depends on the strength and deformation characteristics of the surrounding soil. Therefore, improving the characteristics of backfill soil is an urgent task in reducing the cost of construction for such tunnels. One way to improve the strength and deformation characteristics of soils is the use of reinforcement.

The aim of this study is to recycle carbon fibre using a fluidised bed and to investigate the most suitable operating conditions in order to obtain the highest quality of recycled fibre in term of fibre length. tensile properties and surface energy. All aerospace grade composite was recycled using a fluidised bed process operating between 525 °C and 550 °C with a fluidising velocity of 0. 8 m/s and 1 m/s and a bed depth of 5 cm and Scm. As the recycling temperature can affect the residence time in the fluidised bed. there were two forms of recycled fibre resulted from this process: single <b>fibre</b> <b>filaments</b> elutriated from the bed and bundles of recycled fibre remained in the bed. The elutriated single <b>filaments.</b> recycled <b>fibre</b> possessed approximately 46 % normalised tensile strength with 67 % average normalised tensile modulus while the bundles offered higher tensile properties (the recycled fibre bundles had roughly 67 % normalised tensile strength and 73 % average normalised tensile modulus). Both recycled fibre type had a clean surface with no visible damage. The efforts to improve the tensile properties of recycled fibre were carried out by controlling the oxygen content. However. it was found that low oxygen content, between 6 and 18 per cent. does not improve tensile strength of a recycled carbon fibre. The main parameter associated with the single <b>filament</b> recycled <b>fibre</b> quality is temperature. An increasing temperature tends to decrease the fibre length degradation and tensile strength for recycled single filaments. both of which are due to faster char oxidation and hence. a lower residence Time before elutriation. For the recycled carbon fibre bundles. it was found that the recycled fibre quality is related to fluidising velocity and bed depth. Regarding surface energy. it has been observed that the surface energy of recycled carbon fibre depends on the quantity of acid based functional groups and these changes are slightly dependent on the recycling conditions.

The coordinative bonding between hydroxyl groups of organophile layered silicates using multifunctional reactive polyesterimide anhydrides and amino groups of polyamide 6 is possible. These modified nanolayered silicates are exfoliated in the polyamide matrix and reduce the viscosity of polymer melt at high solution viscosities in comparison to unmodified polyamide 6. With varying relative concentration of polyesterimide anhydride / nanocomposites of layered silicate the author observes a significant and effective change of concentration in amino end groups using OH group terminated layer silicates. This potential of polyamide nanocomposites effects the spin coating process. At Thueringisches Institut fuer Textil- und Kunststoff-Forschung e. V. (Rudolstadt-Schwarza, Federal Repubic of Germany) different test objects are tested according to abrasion behavior, incorporation of fibres, electrical behavior and flammability with positive results.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of classes of indoor free flight models. Some are scale reproductions but others are {{designed}} purely to fly for as long as possible. These models are timed with a stopwatch.The FAI is the international organising body for all air sports worldwide, including aeromodelling. The FAI sanctions World and European Championships for the ultimate indoor duration class designated F1D. F1D models must have a minimum weight of 1.4 grams and a maximum wing span of 55 cm. These models are constructed from very light balsawood sheet and strip, boron <b>filament,</b> carbon <b>fibre,</b> and a transparent covering of plastic film less than 0.5 micrometres thick. The models are powered by 0.4 grams of rubber in a single loop about 9.0 inches long that can be wound to take around 1500 turns. The average propeller RPM during a flight is less than 50 and these models fly at less than walking pace. F1D models require a large space, such as a sports hall, aircraft or dirigible hangar, with the famous atrium of the West Baden Springs Hotel having been previously used for indoor free flight competitions in the United States, and there is even a salt mine in Romania 400 ft underground that has hosted the FAI world F1D championships several times. Single flight times approach forty minutes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} the Export competitiveness and Export performance of Indian textile {{with respect to}} rest of the world. The study focuses on Export performance and competitiveness of Indian textile industry dur-ing the period of 2009 - 2011. Export competitiveness is calculated {{with the help of}} Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) of ten dif-ferent commodities of Textiles like- silk, cotton etc. and results shows that some commodities are more competitive compared to other commodities. The commodities which are more competitive in the international market are cotton, vegetable textile <b>fibres,</b> Manmade <b>filaments,</b> Manmade staple <b>fibres</b> and carpets and other textiles floor coverings. The commodities that are performing fairly well in international market are Manmade filament with the highest value of RCA for the year 2009 & 2010 and Manmade stable fibres for the year 2011.
