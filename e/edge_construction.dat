5000|$|Prior to the CPR's laying rails on {{or about}} September 5, 1882, the Roman Catholic Church {{purchased}} land to establish the St. Hyacinthe Seminary. This land was {{on the north shore}} of the Riviere Sale (La Salle River). This was where the Ferme du College (College Forum) began, on sections 24-25-8-1-E. It was not until 1897 that Msgr. Tache wrote to the Superior of St.-Hyacinthe Seminary in Quebec requesting someone to oversee the college. A young priest, Father Charles Beaudry, answered the call. He decided to move the struggling seminary closer to the railroad. [...] The area was inhabited by English and Métis families who had lain claims to the lands. The Métis gave the rights to work the land over to the English, but the English community was short-lived. The Roman Catholic Church purchased the land to establish the Parish of St.-Hyacinthe of La Salle. In 1891, the municipal council passed Bylaw 144, which formed the St.-Hyacinthe School District. In 1890, a store had also become a post office, and in 1902 a businessman built a grain elevator. [...] More French families came from Quebec to colonize the new parish. In the summer of 1892, the construction of the Maison Chapelle began. It would include a chapel, accommodation for a priest, and a classroom. [...] In 1893, the school moved to Maison Chapelle. During the next decade many families moved from the east, swelling the population to 271 [...] "souls" [...] by 1905. The La Salle region was known for its rich land suitable for cultivation. Many early farmers began by raising cattle, chickens, and sheep. They soon began plowing the land with ox or horse. However, as the land was broken, potholes developed due to the flat prairie not having enough drainage. When it rained, the settlers discovered that the wet soil would stick to everything, leading to the soil being described as [...] "gumbo." [...] In the early 1900s, steam engines were used to break up the land. The adaptation of farming technology has continued. In 1918, a lumber yard was established, and a garage in 1921. In 1924, local farmers organized a union to purchase bulk oil for their equipment and other needs. That same year the Catholic residents organized a chapter of the Knights of Columbus. The town built an outdoor hockey rink in 1925. With the arrival of new settlers, they built a Mennonite Church in 1930. By 1946, the community saw the addition of the La Salle Sports Club, and in 1953 the La Salle Caisse Populaire opened for business. [...] A community paper, The Villager was started in 1977. In 1984/85 the Multisports Complex was built. The La Salle Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1990 by concerned citizens in the area. It became an official member of the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce in 1995 http://lasalleonline.ca/history/. [...] Today, La Salle is the largest urban centre in the RM of Macdonald. With a population of approximately 2,400 (1,450 as of 2006), the community members are active in establishing facilities and infrastructure that will {{meet the needs of the}} urban centre. The community is rapidly growing, serving as a bedroom community for the City of Winnipeg. La Salle Community Centre Inc., the La Salle School Parent Advisory Council, La Salle Nursery School Board, the Knights of Columbus and numerous other local volunteer organizations work together to raise funds for facilities and infrastructure to meet the needs of the community into the new millennium. [...] Local businesses contribute to the progressive and interactive lifestyle of the community. The Domain Co-op Gas Bar & Car Wash, La Salle River Inn, Carman Co-op grocery and hardware, Lagace Trucking, La Salle Towing and Autobody, Peckham's Re-Upholstery, La Salle Insurance & Travel, The Color Lounge,Spectrum Engineering Inc.,Clarity Dental, Body Waves Massage Therapy, Custom <b>Edge</b> <b>Construction,</b> Bailey's Towing La Salle Credit Union and Subway restaurant contribute to an active Main Street. Many other local homebased businesses and an active agricultural community make the community attractive for both residents and business to locate in. With the La Salle River winding through the community, activities can be pursued on a year-round basis. The community has some of the best recreational facilities in the municipality, including a community hall, curling rink, hockey rink, soccer and football fields, and baseball diamonds. The community also has the challenging 18-hole, grass greens, Kingswood Golf and Country Club ...|$|E

40|$|Industry {{generally}} is developing knowledge management strategies and {{companies have been}} found to be delivering significant results; improving decision making, increasing productivity and profitability. In the UK construction industry, key reports such as Latham and Egan, recommend increased collaboration, knowledge exchange, new networks and relationships, to increase the competitiveness and profitability of construction.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} implementation and discovery of networks within all disciplines of life, the study of connectivity, specifically sub-graphs within these larger networks, has become increasingly important. Network theory has been helpful in cancer research, finding an efficient business model, and developing comprehensive security measures.

40|$|The recent {{resurgence}} {{of interest in}} utilizing laminar flow on aircraft surfaces for reduction in skin friction drag has generated {{a considerable amount of}} research in natural laminar flow (NLF) and hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) on transonic aircraft wings. This research has focused primarily on airfoil design and understanding transition behavior with little concern for the surface imperfections and manufacturing variations inherent to most production aircraft. In order for laminar flow to find wide-spread use on production aircraft, techniques for constructing the wings must be found such that the large surface imperfections present in the leading edge region of current aircraft do not occur. Toward this end, a modification to existing leading <b>edge</b> <b>construction</b> techniques was devised such that the resulting surface did not contain large gaps and steps as are common on current production aircraft of this class. A lowspeed experiment was first conducted on a simulation of the surface that would result from this construction technique. Preston tube measurements of the boundary layer downstream of the simulated joint and flow visualization using sublimation chemicals validated the literature on the effects of steps on a laminar boundary layer. These results also indicated that the construction technique was indeed compatible with laminar flow. In order to fully validate the compatibility of this construction technique with laminar flow, thus proving {{that it is possible to}} build wings that are smooth enough to be used on business jets and light transports in a manner compatible with laminar flow, a flight experiment is being conducted. In this experiment Mach number and Reynolds number will be matched in a real flight environment. The experiment is being conducted using the NASA Dryden F- 104 Flight Test Fixture (FTF). The FTF is a low aspect ratio ventral fin mounted beneath an F- 104 G research aircraft. A new nose shape was designed and constructed for this experiment. This nose shape provides an accelerating pressure gradient in the leading edge region. By flying the aircraft at appropriate Mach numbers and altitudes, this nose shape simulates the leading edge region of a laminar flow wing for a business jet or light transport. Manufactured into the nose shape is a spanwise slot located approximately four inches downstream of the leading edge. The slot, which is an inch wide and one-eighth of an inch deep allows the simulation of surface imperfections, such as gaps and steps at skin joints, which will occur on aircraft using this new construction technique. By placing strips of aluminum of various sizes and shapes in the slot, the effect on the boundary layer of different sizes and shapes of steps and gaps will be examined. It is planned to use five different configurations, differing primarily in the size and number of gaps. Downstream of the slot, the state of the boundary layer is determined using hot film gages and Stanton gages. Agreement between these two very different techniques of measuring boundary layer properties is considered important to being able to state with confidence the effects on the boundary layer of the simulated manufacturing imperfections. To date, the aircraft has not flown. First flights of the aircraft are on schedule to begin October 4, 1993. Low-speed, preliminary experiments at matching Reynolds numbers have been completed...|$|E
