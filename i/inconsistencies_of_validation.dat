40|$|Different {{models have}} been {{recently}} proposed for representing temporal data, tracking historical information, and recovering {{the state of the}} document as of any given time, in XML documents. After presenting an abstract model for temporal XML, we discuss the problem <b>of</b> the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the temporal constraints imposed by this model. We first review the problem of checking and fixing isolated temporal inconsistencies. Then, we move on to study <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> a document when many temporal <b>inconsistencies</b> <b>of</b> different kinds are present. We study the conditions that allow to treat each inconsistency isolated from the rest, and give the corresponding proofs. These properties are intended to be the basis of efficient algorithms for checking temporal consistency in XML...|$|R

5000|$|Consequentia mirabilis (Latin for [...] "admirable consequence"), {{also known}} as Clavius's Law, is used in {{traditional}} and classical logic to establish the truth of a proposition from the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> its negation. It is thus similar to reductio ad absurdum, but it can prove a proposition true using just its negation. It states that if a proposition {{is a consequence of}} its negation, then it is true, for consistency. It can thus be demonstrated without using any other principle, but that of consistency. (Barnes claims in passing that the term 'consequentia mirabilis' refers only to the inference of the proposition from the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> its negation, and that the term 'Lex Clavia' (or Clavius' Law) refers to the inference of the proposition's negation from the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> the proposition.) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that knowledgebases may contain inconsistencies. We provide {{a measure to}} quantify the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> a knowledgebase, thereby allowing for the comparison <b>of</b> the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> various knowledgebases, represented as first-order logic formulas [...] We use quasi-classical (QC) logic for this purpose. QC logic is a formalism for reasoning and analysing inconsistent information. It {{has been used as}} the basis of a framework for measuring inconsistency in propositional theories. Here we extend this framework, by using a first-order logic version of QC logic for measuring inconsistency in first-order theories. We motivate the QC logic approach by considering some formulae as database or knowledgebase integrity constraints. We then define a measure <b>of</b> extrinsic <b>inconsistency</b> {{that can be used to}} compare the <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> different knowledgebases. This measure takes into account both the language used and the underlying domain. We show why this definition also captures the intrinsic <b>inconsistency</b> <b>of</b> a knowledgebase. We also provide a formalization of paraconsistent equality, called quasi-equality, and we use this in an extended example of an application for measuring inconsistency between heterogeneous sources of information and integrity constraints prior to merging. ...|$|R
