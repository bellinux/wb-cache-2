40|$|Small satellites, {{with total}} mass less than 250 kg. is rapidly gaining {{worldwide}} interest. So far however, launch costs have prevented widespread {{development and use}} of such satellites. If launch costs are considerably reduced and a reliable launch vehicle is made available, this will promote the development of new and cheaper design and manufacturing methods. This will stimulate the small satellite market. The Norwegian Space Centre (NSC) and the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) is studying the design of a dedicated launch facility for small polar orbiting satellites, called the Polar Satellite Service (PSS). This paper discusses the development of PSS. It focuses {{on the development of the}} first European facility that will offer integration launch and operation of small satellites in polar orbits. PSS is offered for USD 5 mill., including launch vehicle. PSS will be a cost-effective and flexible service based on existing infrastructure of Andøya Rocket Range (ARR) (69 °I 72 ̆ 7 N. 16 ° 012 ̆ 7 E), the launch facility of the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC) and Esrange (67 ° 562 ̆ 7 N, 21 ° 042 ̆ 7 E), the operations center of the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). A mobile <b>down</b> <b>range</b> telemetry <b>station</b> located at Svalbard (78 ° 032 ̆ 7 N. 13 ° 372 ̆ 7 E) can be included when required. The availability of a dedicated launch vehicle is essential when a low cost service is established. Different launch vehicles have therefore been assessed, and requests for proposal have been issued. From the replies, the new PacAstro 2 ̆ 7 s PA- 2 launch vehicle was found to be most compliant with the requirements. PA- 2 launch vehicle can place 225 kg in 750 km circular polar orbit. Technical, operational, market and organizational aspects of PSS were studied in 1992 / 93 through a feasibility study conducted as a joint Norwegian-Swedish project. The first launch is planned for 1996 if the development starts in 1994 and if the market develops as expected...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Time Transfer by Laser Link (T 2 L 2) {{experiment}} {{has been}} developed in close collaboration between Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales and Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur. The aim is to synchronize remote ultra-stable clocks over large-scale distances using two laser <b>ranging</b> <b>stations.</b> This ground to space time transfer has been derived from laser telemetry technology with dedicated space equipment designed to record arrival time of laser pulses on board the satellite. For 3 years, specific campaigns have been organized to prove T 2 L 2 performance. In April 2012, we performed a 2 -week campaign with our two laser <b>ranging</b> <b>stations,</b> Métrologie Optique and French Transportable Laser <b>Ranging</b> <b>Station,</b> to demonstrate the T 2 L 2 time transfer accuracy in co-location. We have compared three independent time transfer techniques: T 2 L 2, GPS, and direct measurement, with both an event timer and an interval counter. The most important result obtained in this campaign was a mean agreement between T 2 L 2 and a direct comparison better than 200 ps. This is the first major step to validate the uncertainty budget of the entire T 2 L 2 experiment. This paper focuses on this campaign setup and the obtained results...|$|R
