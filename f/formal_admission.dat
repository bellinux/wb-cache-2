Typically applicants must submit a completed application, proof of an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent) plus transcripts, resume, two essays, and a nonrefundable application fee. Some programs require additional specific classes {{to be part of the}} initial three before <b>formal</b> <b>admission.</b> Students will be denied admission indefinitely if they fail to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the Proseminar course.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po {{were found on the}} hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E
25|$|Initiation is a rite {{of passage}} marking {{entrance}} or acceptance into a group or society. It could also be a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> to adulthood in a community or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also signify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role. Examples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, Christian baptism or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or recruit training. A person taking the initiation ceremony in traditional rites, such as those depicted in these pictures, is called an initiate.|$|E

500|$|The Pi {{chapter of}} the {{national}} fraternity Pi Lambda Phi was established at Dartmouth College in 1924. [...] The membership of the Dartmouth chapter was predominantly Jewish. [...] About half of the college's fraternities at the time had national constitutions that explicitly forbade membership to Jews, and for many of the other chapters, it was an informal policy to exclude membership to Jewish students. [...] The national constitution of Pi Lambda Phi expressly accepted members of all religions. [...] Pi Lambda Phi was not initially accepted by the Dartmouth Greek community, and efforts in 1924 and 1925 to gain <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> into the Interfraternity Council failed. [...] The fraternity was finally recognized in the spring of 1927. [...] The fraternity's first residence, purchased in 1924, was a building on South Street originally occupied by a Roman Catholic church. [...] The fraternity would reside there until 1961, when it moved to a house north of Webster Avenue on Occom Ridge. [...] The chapter dissolved in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|There were no <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> {{requirements}} or {{procedures to}} join the community at Fruitlands, {{and there was no}} official record-keeping of members. Many residents stayed only {{for a short period of}} time and most lists are based on the journals of Alcott's wife Abby May. Residents of the Fruitlands came to be called [...] "consecrated cranks" [...] and followed strict principles and virtues. They strongly believed in the ideas of simplicity, sincerity, and brotherly love.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ceremony}} of the <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> of a Benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of Abingdon. [...] The newly elected abbot {{was to put}} off his shoes {{at the door of}} the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession. [...] After proceeding up the nave, he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary, and placed in his stall. [...] The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his staff of office. [...] He then put on his shoes in the vestry, and a chapter was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II in Europe the French mandate {{may be said to}} {{have been}} {{terminated}} without any formal action {{on the part of the}} League of Nations or its successor the United Nations. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: [...] "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." [...] So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained. The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.|$|E
2500|$|South Africa sought BRIC {{membership}} since 2009 and {{the process}} for <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> began as early as August 2010. South Africa was officially admitted as a BRIC nation on December 24, 2010, after being invited by China and the other BRIC countries to join the group. The capital [...] "S" [...] in BRICS stands for South Africa. President Jacob Zuma attend the BRICS summit in Sanya in April 2011 as a full member. South Africa stands at {{a unique position to}} influence African economic growth and investment. According to Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs who originally coined the term, Africa's combined current gross domestic product is reasonably similar to that of Brazil and Russia, and slightly above that of India. South Africa is a [...] "gateway" [...] to Southern Africa and Africa in general as the most developed African country. China is South Africa's largest trading partner, and India wants to increase commercial ties with Africa. South Africa is also Africa's largest economy, but as number 31 in global GDP economies it is far behind its new partners.|$|E

50|$|Informal {{admission}}s in South African law {{are part}} of the South African law of evidence. Briefly, an admission is a statement made by a party, in civil or criminal proceedings, which is adverse to that party’s case. Informal admissions, which are usually made out of court, must be distinguished from <b>formal</b> <b>admissions,</b> made in the pleadings or in court. <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> are binding on the maker, and are generally made {{in order to reduce the}} number of issues before the court; an informal admission is merely an item of evidence that can be contradicted or explained away.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} for <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{is that they}} save time and costs. The system encourages people to admit facts which are not in dispute, so that the trial is not derailed and unnecessarily delayed by extraneous and superfluous issues.|$|R
50|$|Even after withdrawal, a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> {{may still}} {{be taken into account}} as an item of evidence; it may still {{constitute}} an informal admission, in other words.|$|E
50|$|Note, {{however, the}} effect of a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> by the accused: it does not bind the State to a meaning {{fundamentally}} at variance with the State’s case.|$|E

50|$|<b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> may be {{made during}} pleadings, or during the trial itself. Section 15 of the CPEA {{provides}} {{that it is not}} necessary for a party to prove a fact formally admitted; nor is it competent to disprove a fact so admitted.|$|R
50|$|Courts {{should be}} wary about {{accepting}} <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> from an unrepresented accused on points beyond the personal {{knowledge of the}} accused. This occurs all too often in practice. The accused’s presence {{at the scene of}} the crime is within his personal knowledge; the veracity of the blood tests is obviously not.|$|R
50|$|Informal admissions, {{on the one}} hand, {{are usually}} made out of court, {{although}} they {{can be made in}} formal settings (even to a magistrate, for example); that, however, does not make them <b>formal.</b> <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions,</b> on the other hand, are usually made as part of the pleadings, or in the court itself.|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal of a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> in {{criminal}} trial is possible, if the formalities have been complied with, but a withdrawn admission {{may still have}} some evidentiary value.|$|E

5000|$|In S v Malebo, Hiemstra CJ {{held that}} [...] "sufficient proof" [...] meant {{conclusive}} proof. Therefore a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> under section 220 immediately became conclusive {{of the fact}} covered thereby.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the present}} <b>Formal</b> <b>Admissions</b> to Psychiatric Hospitals Act (BOPZ) hinder rather than {{facilitate}} good psychiatric care? This question {{is being asked}} more and more often. The Dutch Psychiatric Society recently advocated a new law that provides more possibilities for involuntary admission and treatment. International regulations emphasize the necessity to be reluctant {{with the use of}} coercion but leave room for a broader and more differentiated approach than {{can be found in the}} present Dutch Act. However, it is important to recognize the influence of other factors as well, e. g. the organization of mental-health care and the competencies of the health-care workers. There are good reasons to replace the present Dutch Act, but this should not be done overnight. Careful consideration is called for and empirical research should be stimulate...|$|R
