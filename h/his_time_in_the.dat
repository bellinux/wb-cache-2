5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas.

Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} <b>his</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
