2500|$|V-J Day in Times Square (also V-Day and The Kiss) is a {{photograph}} by Alfred Eisenstaedt that portrays a U.S. Navy sailor grabbing and kissing a stranger—a woman in a white dress—on Victory over Japan Day ("V-J Day") in New York City's Times Square on August 14, 1945. The photograph was published a week later in Life magazine, among many photographs of celebrations around the United States that were presented in a twelve-page section titled [...] "Victory Celebrations". A two-page spread faces three other kissing poses among celebrators in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City; and Miami opposite Eisenstaedt's, which was given a <b>full-page</b> <b>display.</b> Kissing was a favorite pose encouraged by medi{{a photograph}}ers of service personnel during the war, but Eisenstaedt was photographing a spontaneous event that occurred in Times Square soon before {{the announcement of the}} end of the war with Japan was made by U.S. President Harry S. Truman at seven o'clock. Similar jubilation spread quickly with the news.|$|E
6000|$|The janitor {{took the}} {{manuscript}} and disappeared. I {{turned to my}} desk again and was soon absorbed in arranging a <b>full-page</b> <b>display</b> of plumbers' furnishings for the advertising. It had {{occurred to me that}} by arranging the picture matter in a neat device with verses from [...] "Home Sweet Home" [...] running through it in double-leaded old English type, I could set up a page that would be the delight of all business readers and make this number of the magazine a conspicuous success. My mind was so absorbed that I scarcely noticed that over an hour elapsed before the janitor returned.|$|E

A {{photograph}} of a woman (who was later alleged to be Shakur) wearing thick-rimmed black glasses, with a high hairdo pulled tightly over her head, and pointing a gun, was widely displayed in banks. The New York Clearing House Association paid for <b>full-page</b> ads <b>displaying</b> material about Shakur.

40|$|A {{glance at}} any {{newspaper}} will reveal hundreds of advertisements. Some are elaborate, <b>full-page</b> <b>displays,</b> {{while the majority}} is in the more economical classified sections. People and firms advertise for all sort of reasons. We can read about job vacancies, new products, people wanting to sell or purchase houses and cars, announcements of births and deaths, lonely hearts looking for partners, home services and many others. The list goes on, and expanding everyday. The uses of advertisements are undisputed. Large companies depend heavily on advertisements to make their products known to the consumers. These companies {{play a major role}} in the development of sports in our country. Without them acting as sponsors we would not be able to stage international sporting events [...] Most magazines and periodicals survive because of advertisements. The people or firms that advertise provide the necessary finance to keep these magazines running. Both parties benefit. It is the same when people want to sell or buy houses, cars and other things. Through advertisements they can come in contact with people not normally met in normal daily life. Again the best buyers or sellers can be picked out and the most suitable bargains reached. In short advertisements enable people to widen their choices and chances in whatever they wish to obtain or discard. As useful as it is, advertisements are sometimes abused by unscrupulous peopl...|$|R
5000|$|The CPT 8000 was the company's first {{microcomputer}} product, {{exhibited in}} spring of 1976. It was a self-contained desktop machine with two floppy diskette drives, a movable keyboard, and a <b>full-page</b> vertically oriented <b>display</b> with black characters {{on a white}} background, for a [...] view of text on paper. It was promoted as familiar {{and easy to use}} for those experienced with typewriters.|$|R
50|$|A Big Little Book was {{typically}} 3⅝&Prime; wide and 4½&Prime; high, with 212 to 432 pages making an approximate thickness of 1½&Prime;. The interior book design usually <b>displayed</b> <b>full-page</b> black-and-white illustrations {{on the right}} side, facing the pages of text on the left. Stories were often related to radio programs (The Shadow), comic strips (The Gumps), children's books (Uncle Wiggily), novels (John Carter of Mars) and movies (Bambi). Later books of the series had interior color illustrations.|$|R
5000|$|However a {{tendency}} then arose for journalists {{to follow the}} company's <b>full-page</b> <b>display</b> advertising and drop the first word in Wolseley Siddeley — [...] "Siddeley Autocars made by (in smaller type face) the Wolseley Tool [...] [...] [...]" [...] Certainly it was true the new engines were named Siddeley engines. Meanwhile, under Siddeley Wolseley maintained the sales lead left to him by Austin but, now run from London not (Austin's base) Birmingham, the whole business failed to cover overheads. A board member, Walter Chetwynd, was set to find a solution. It was decided the business operated from too many different locations. First the board closed the Crayford Kent works, moving the whole operation back to Birmingham and dropping production of commercial vehicles and taxicabs - {{a large number of}} which, 500+, were made during Siddeley's time including an early 10 hp taxicab made in 1908 sold to a Mr W R Morris of Holywell St. Oxford who ran a garage there and hire car business as well as making bicycles. Then the London head office followed. After some heated discussions Siddeley resigned in the spring of 1909 and Rothschild went too. Ernest Hopwood was appointed managing director in August 1909. Siddeley was to go on to manage the Deasy Motor Company and a notable commercial career.|$|E
40|$|Arrays of {{actuated}} dots {{may one day}} produce refreshable Braille {{that allows}} the visually impaired to read a full screen of electronic text. According to the World Health Organization, about 314 million people are visually impaired, with 45 million blind. To benefit from state-of-the-art digital technology and the many emerging computer-controlled devices, these individuals need efficient and inexpensive refreshable <b>full-page</b> Braille <b>displays.</b> This would provide them effective ways to rapidly exchange information (e. g., e-mail and text messaging), {{as well as providing}} access to the plethora of information on the Web and other forms of electronic databases and archives (e. g., educational, employment, and recreational opportunities). The raised dots of Braille code—developed by the 16 -year old Louis Braille in 1825 —had a dramatic impact on blind people’s ability to read and write. Braille (whose bicentennial birthday i...|$|R
5000|$|The Ministry of Labour and Employment <b>displays</b> <b>full-page</b> {{advertisements}} against {{child labour}} in national newspapers at periodic intervals. The government has also instituted pre-departure information sessions for [...] domestic workers migrating abroad on {{the risks of}} exploitation. These measures include distinguishing between 'Emigration Check Required' (ECR) and 'Emigration Check Not Required' (ECNR) passports. ECR passport holders must prove to government authorities that they shall not be exploited when travelling abroad, {{if they wish to}} travel. Many Indian workers pay large sums of money to agents who facilitate their emigration outside the official channels and willingly emigrate despite the risks, drawn by the hope of higher salaries abroad. Therefore, a dream of better future often lures the people abroad and hence trafficking cannot entirely be prevented. India ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol 2011.|$|R
