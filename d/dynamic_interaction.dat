25|$|The {{cause of}} {{executive}} dysfunction is heterogeneous, as many neurocognitive processes {{are involved in}} the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory {{play a role in the}} severity of executive dysfunction through <b>dynamic</b> <b>interaction</b> with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.|$|E
30|$|A network can {{experience}} stresses when the intermittency of wind power generation coincides with critical operating conditions. Therefore, the shed-loads resulting through all disturbances are referred {{in this paper}} as the total shed-load. The total shed-load can be categorized into four elements of shed-loads. They are the shed-load due to inadequacy of wind power generation (excluding <b>dynamic</b> <b>interactions</b> and exchanges resulting shed-load), <b>dynamic</b> <b>interactions</b> and exchanges, contingencies, and unavailability of standby power generation. A {{detailed description of the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>interactions</b> and exchanges is given in section  2.2. The first two shed-load components are influenced by intermittency of wind power generation. Therefore, the term ‘shed-load due to intermittency of wind power’ refers to the sum of the first two elements of shed-loads.|$|R

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a <b>dynamic</b> <b>interaction</b> between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

2500|$|Political Economy was {{introduced}} in American anthropology primarily through the support of Julian Steward, a student of Kroeber. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the <b>dynamic</b> <b>interaction</b> of man, environment, technology, social structure, {{and the organization of}} work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at Columbia University. [...] At this time, Columbia saw an influx of World War II veterans who were attending school thanks to the GI Bill. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, Eleanor Leacock, Roy Rappaport, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, Morton Fried, Robert F. Murphy, and influenced other scholars such as Elman Service, Marvin Harris and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in Puerto Rico.|$|E
2500|$|... "Resonance" [...] is {{a central}} {{operative}} principle of the cosmos as conceived by the Huainanzi. The phrase itself means [...] "stimulus" [...] (gan 感) and [...] "response" [...] (ying 應), which is how we have translated it when the Huainanzi refers specifically to the discrete component processes that the term denotes. Fundamentally, [...] "resonance" [...] {{is a process of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>interaction</b> that transcends the limits of time, space, and ordinary linear causality. Through the mechanism of resonance, an event in one location (the [...] "stimulus") produces simultaneous effects in another location (the [...] "response"), even though the two phenomena have no direct spatial or mechanical contact. They may indeed be separated by vast gulfs of space. For example, connections between celestial events (eclipses, planetary motions) and events in the human community were understood as examples of [...] "resonance." [...] For the authors of the Huainanzi, such connections were not coincidence or mere correspondence but dynamic influences exchanged through the energetic medium of qi. All phenomena are both composed of and impelled by qi, and since all currently differentiated qi emerged from an originally undifferentiated Grand One, all qi remains mutually resonantly linked. The pathways of resonance are not random, however. Objects are most sensitive to resonant influences emanating from other objects that share the same constituent form of qi.

2500|$|Similarly, {{the fluid}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>interaction</b> of {{particles}} suspended in a flow were investigated. The drag forces exerted on the particles by the relative velocity by {{them and the}} flow were treated as additional forces acting on the particles. Therefore, these multiphase flow phenomena including a solid e.g.~particulate and a gaseous or fluid phase resolve the particulate phase by discrete methods, while gas or liquid flow is described by continuous methods, and therefore, is labelled the combined continuum and discrete model (CCDM) as applied by Kawaguchi et al., Hoomans, Xu 1997 and Xu 1998. [...] Due to a discrete description of the solid phase, constitutive relations are omitted, and therefore, leads {{to a better understanding}} of the fundamentals. This was also concluded by Zhu 2007 et al. and Zhu 2008 et al. during a review on particulate flows modelled with the CCDM approach. It has seen a mayor development in last two decades and describes motion of the solid phase by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on an individual particle scale and the remaining phases are treated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the method is recognized as an effective tool to investigate into the interaction between a particulate and fluid phase as reviewed by Yu and Xu, Feng and Yu [...] and Deen et al. [...] Based on the CCDM methodology the characteristics of spouted and fluidised beds are predicted by Gryczka et al.|$|E
