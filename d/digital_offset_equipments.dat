40|$|In recent years, digital print engines {{have made}} marked strides in {{increasing}} {{their level of}} image quality. What was once a ragged, de-saturated, and uninspiring color document can now be made sharp and vibrant. The difference between the image quality of digital printers relative to offset lithographic presses is shrinking—but just how big is this difference? What particular image quality parameters contribute most to this difference? And how much does this difference matter to the end user? The objective {{of this research was}} to answer these questions by evaluating the image quality gap between digital print technologies and offset lithography and determining the importance of this gap to end users. It was found that there were significant differences in perceived value of prints made on <b>digital</b> versus <b>offset</b> printing <b>equipment,</b> with the prints on coated media from <b>offset</b> <b>equipment</b> being generally preferred and the prints on uncoated media from digital printers being generally preferred...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{differences}} in image quality of digital printers relative to offset lithographic presses have been becoming ever subtler. In 2007, experimentation was conducted within the Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at the Rochester Institute of Technology examining this difference. It was {{found that there were}} significant differences in the perceived value of prints made on <b>digital</b> versus <b>offset</b> printing <b>equipment.</b> Prints on coated media made on <b>offset</b> <b>equipment</b> were generally preferred, while the prints on uncoated media made on digital printers were frequently assigned higher values. The results of this experiment were possibly compromised by the reality that there were unintended shifts in the color balance of the prints made on some of the digital equipment relative to the offset reference prints that the participants in the study were asked to disregard. The present study was conducted to examine the effect, if any, of these unintended color shifts and to further probe the effect of the media on the perceived image quality differences between high-end <b>digital</b> presses and <b>offset</b> lithography. The impact of observer image evaluation skill on the perceived image quality differences was also examined. The experimental results suggested that the color balance shift had minimal impact on the perceived image quality differences, though contrast played a significant role. The media also had a strong effect on perceived quality. Unsurprisingly, skilled observers tended to rate images more critically than unskilled participants, though this effect was only statistically significant for photo-based images on uncoated paper...|$|R

40|$|Principles and {{techniques}} useful for calibrated color reproduction are defined. These results {{are derived from}} a project to take digital images designed {{on a variety of}} different color monitors and accurately reproduce them in a journal using <b>digital</b> <b>offset</b> printing. Most of the images printed were reproduced without access to the image as viewed in its original form; the color specification was derived entirely from calorimetric specification. The techniques described here are not specific to offset printing and can be applied equally well to other digital color devices. The reproduction system described is calibrated using CIE tristimulus values. An image is represented as a set of three-dimensional points, and the color output device as a three-dimensional solid surrounding the set of all reproducible colors for that device, called its gamut. The shapes of the monitor and the printer gamuts are very different, so it is necessary to transform the image points to fit into the destination gamut, a process we call gamut mopping. This paper describes the principles that control gamut mapping. Included also are some details on monitor and printer calibration, and a brief description of how digital halftone screens for offset printing are prepared...|$|R

Ion channel recording with planar bilayer lipid membranes (BLM) is scalable and has very high sensitivity. A HTS system based on BLM ion channel recording faces three main challenges: (i) design of scalable microfluidic devices; (ii) design of compact ultra-low-noise transimpedance amplifiers able to detect currents in the pA range with bandwidth > 10 kHz; (iii) design of compact, robust and scalable systems that integrate these two elements. This paper presents a low-noise transimpedance amplifier with integrated A/D conversion realized in CMOS 0. 35 um technology.

50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (<b>digital)</b> <b>offset</b> presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} method {{for determining the}} total offset in lidar signal created by a daytime background-illumination component and electrical or <b>digital</b> <b>offset.</b> Unlike existing techniques, here the signal square-range-correction procedure is initially performed using the total signal recorded by lidar, without subtraction of the offset component. While performing the square-range correction, the lidar-signal monotonic change due to the molecular component of the atmosphere is simultaneously compen-sated. After these corrections, the total offset is found by determining {{the slope of the}} above transformed signal versus a function that is defined as a ratio of the squared range and two molecular scattering components, the backscatter and transmittance. The slope is determined over a far end of the measure-ment range where aerosol loading is zero or, at least, minimum. An important aspect of this method is that the presence of a moderate aerosol loading over the far end does not increase dramatically the error in determining the lidar-signal offset. The comparison of the new technique with a conventional tech-nique of the total-offset estimation is made using simulated and experimental data. The one-directional and multiangle measurements are analyzed and specifics in the estimate of the uncertainty limits due to remaining shifts in the inverted lidar signals are discussed. The use of the new technique allows a more accurate estimate of the signal constant offset, and accordingly, yields more accurate lidar-signal inver...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Hand-held {{devices are}} among the most {{successful}} consumer electronics in modern society. Behind these successful devices, lies a key analog design technique that involves high-performance analog-to-digital conversion combined with very low power consumption. This dissertation presents two different approaches to achieving high power efficiency from a two-step pipelined architecture, which is generally {{known as one of the}} most power-consuming analog-to-digital converters. In the first approach, an analog feedback loop of a residue amplifier in a two-step pipelined analog-to-digital converter is reconfigured digitally using a single comparator and an R- 2 R digital-to-analog converter. This comparator-based structure can reduce power consumption of a conventional two-step pipelined analog-to-digital converter which consists of an opamp-based residue amplifier followed by a second- stage analog-to-digital converter. In addition, this dissertation includes circuit design techniques that provide a <b>digital</b> <b>offset</b> correction for the comparator-based two-step structure, binary-weighted switching for an R- 2 R digital-to-analog converter, and reference trimming for a flash analog-to-digital converter. A 10 -b prototype analog-to-digital converter achieves an FOM of 121 fJ/conversion-step under 0. 7 -V supply. The second approach provides a way to achieve low power consumption for a high-resolution two-step pipelined analog-to-digital converter. An opamp is designed to consume optimized static power using a quarter-scaled residue gain together with minimized loading capacitance from the proposed second stage. A 14 -b prototype analog-to-digital converter achieves an FOM of 31. 3 fJ/conversion-step with an ENOB of 11. 4 b, which is the lowest FOM in high-resolution analog-to-digital converters having greater than an ENOB of 10 b.
