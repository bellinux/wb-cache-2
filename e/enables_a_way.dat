40|$|One of {{the effects}} of ecocritical {{scholarship}} {{can be seen in the}} questioning of postmodern attempts of a radical constructivism that understands the world as a discursive phenomenon and that opposes any notion of a ‘reality’ outside those discursive entanglements. In light of environmental crises in particular, to doubt an extradiscursive reality seems inappropriate. However, I will argue in this essay that narratives of catastrophe do follow specific dramatising rhetorics, and I will show how Indra Sinha’s Animal’s People questions and ultimately deconstructs these. By radically questioning the idea of a stable reality and authentic means to narrate it, postcolonial ecocriticism in general, and Animal’s People in particular, engenders a sense of the tension between reality and representational ideology, and it <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of experiencing this conflict through the eyes of an ecological posthumanism...|$|E

This causes problems in and with architectural analysis, which can have serious consequences {{for the quality of}} a system being developed, as this quality might be incompletely or wrongly assessed. This paper presents a domain model, which {{can be used as a}} common ground among analysts and architects to capture and explicitly share such knowledge. This <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to overcome some of the obstacles imposed by the multi-disciplinary context in which architectural analysis takes place. To apply the domain model in practice, we have created a tool implementing (part of) this domain model for capturing and using explicit architectural knowledge during analysis. We validate the tool and domain model in the context of an industrial case study. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} Foucault’s {{multifaceted}} understanding of modern power, the sovereignty–discipline–government complex, {{as a means}} of re-conceptualizing, and finding critical analogues for, what is perhaps psychology’s most characteristic formof applied practice: psychotherapy. One of the chief assets of this model is that it enables one to think the dynamic interchange between capillary and modern state forms of power. An explication of this particular interchange is one of the primary focuses of this paper. A brief characterization of technologized disciplinarity is offered as a first tentative model for psychotherapeutic practice. Whereas the idea of a disciplinary technology provides a means of thinking the instrumentation of psychotherapeutic power, Foucault’s notion of the pastorate is seen {{as a means of}} thinking its rationality. The notion of technologies of subjectivity <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of conceiving of psychotherapy’s functionality as an interchange between a structural apparatus of influence and a micro-politics of self. The confluence of these notions allows one to speak meaningfully of a ‘governmental psychotherapy’, a complex mode of power that operates perhaps both more widely and more privately than one may at first have suspected...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of Israeli {{military}} and civil cemeteries that I conducted between July and September 2007, {{this article focuses on}} the increasingly common custom of mounting family photographs on tombstones of Israeli fallen soldiers—a phenomenon unique in Israel to military cemeteries in particular, although it is forbidden both by Jewish law {{as well as by the}} Israeli Law of Military Cemeteries legislated in 1950.

My main argument is that this practice subverts the most fundamental patterns of commemoration prevailing in contemporary occidental military cemeteries in formal-spatial, symbolic, and ideological terms. Analyzing particularly the formal and social positions Israeli soldiers occupy in professional and amateur family photographs mounted on military tombstones, this article offers a series of historical, theoretical, and social interpretations of this growing phenomenon, and opens up the question of the relationship between politics, death, commemoration, and the family photograph...|$|E
40|$|Background Energy network {{companies}} are commonly attributed the public task to help society in becoming greener {{in the domain}} of energy. This extra public task has high costs and comes with high uncertainties. It may also compete with existing public tasks of network companies. When network {{companies are}} involved in local green initiatives, they encounter dilemmas and need to arrange trade-offs among multiple public values. It may also compete with existing tasks of network companies. Therefore, these network companies can face dilemmas when involved in local green initiatives. The aim {{of this paper is to}} reflect on the role of energy network companies in the face of these dilemmas. What is the role of energy network companies in coping with conflicting public values when helping local initiatives that create a greener energy system? Methods We answer this question via an essay that reflects on existing research in the Dutch energy sector. Our answer is derived from the fields of law, politics, policy, economics and engineering about the role of network companies. Results and discussion We argue that these five perspectives leave the role of energy network companies in the energy transition under-articulated. Our additional answer is based on our own empirical research that focuses on how network companies currently deal with dilemmas between multiple public tasks.

40|$|Future {{trends in}} energy {{generation}} are {{renewable energy sources}} and distributed energy generation. In control systems, these changes require higher automatization, more intelligent devices and secure and reliable communication. Another requirement is faster communication. Building {{a system that is}} able to fulfill real-time communication requirements over network layer is a hindrance to automation systems. There are multiple protocols that can manage the requirements, but many of them have limitations and requirements of their own. The limitations can be related to packet sizes, used devices or they may require a license. Tunneling protocols can bring a more general solution for the real-time problem. Tunneling Ethernet communication over network layer and letting the tunneling protocol to handle the network layer packaging instead of the communication protocol removes the need of a layer 3 protocol. Layer 2 tunneling provides a direct connection between separate local area networks. It <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for devices {{to communicate with each other}} over network layer using layer 2 communication protocols. Tunnel uses a pre-configured route to the destination gateway device making the routing of messages simpler and faster than with traditional IP routing. Layer 2 tunneling can be used in any communication system that utilizes layer 2 and layer 3 communication. This thesis focuses on use of tunneling in automation systems. The purpose of this thesis is to provide information and possible solutions for layer 2 Ethernet tunneling. The main focus is in suitable tunneling protocols and communication protocols, but also security and resilience solutions are studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and analyze how the European union relates to the different dimensions of abortion. What kind of problem is abortion and whose right is it? Does difference framings of the problem enable different solutions? By analyzing debates from the European parliament through Carol Lee Bacchis method “What’s the problem approach” I have come to see that different representations of a problem changes the problem it self. This emphasis that a problem is a problem in one context, but not in an other. Depending on the work of, among others, Barbara Hobson and Ailbhe Smyth I have focused upon the European union as a economical project, leaving social issues to national competence. This makes the EU a patriarchal project that fails to guarantee women’s rights. By not being able to assure women the right of abortion, the women of Europe is treated as second class citizens. Through the eyes of the European union my material has shown that abortion is not only a conflict between the woman’s right to choose and the child’s right to live, but also a conflict of democracy. National sovereignty is challenged by a European citizenship of women. The right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU puts the European question of abortion in a new focus. By framing the problem of abortion as a problem of mobility it <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of placing women’s right in the free market system.

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of nanotechnology {{offers a new}} perspective {{in the field of}} optics. The study of light-material interaction has evolved into a nanoscale regime with its dimension smaller than the wavelength of light. While there are pressing needs of optical applications with higher resolution and efficiency, one important hurdle is the so-called diffraction limit that originates from light???s inherent wave nature. Based on the localized electromagnetic field generation due to the resonant oscillation of electron plasma in metal, plasmonics offers new opportunities for manipulating light at the subwavelength scale. This dissertation investigates the effects of electromagnetic field confinement on light-material interaction inside nanoscale metal-dielectric composite structures. 	 	One of the simplest structures is a subwavelength hole perforated on a thin metal film. The scalar diffraction theory by Kirchhoff fails to explain the nature of light at nanoscale. Later, it was pointed out by Bethe that light in a small hole can be represented by the electric and magnetic dipole fields which satisfy the boundary conditions at the screen. Using near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM), I have experimentally studied light transmission through a subwavelength hole, and found an unusually large amount of phase shift in the transmitted light contradicting Bethe???s theory. Such effect is explained by the strong contribution of in-plane electric dipole field due to the excitation of surface plasmon wave. 	An important challenge to the study of a localized light field is the requirement of non-traditional optical tools that can probe the near-field of light with subwavelength resolution. The cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope, which is a variation of the electron microscope (that has an imaging resolution better than 10 nm), is employed to generate a point-like dipole light source using an electron beam in a controlled way. By using CL to excite local plasmonic modes in a nanoscale metal-air-semiconductor bubbles, I demonstrate an ultrasmall mode volume and cavity-enhanced luminescence from a plasmonic structure. Numerical calculation based on a point dipole model indicates that such an effect is a result of increased local optical density of states (LDOS) due to a strong localized field. This device <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to generate localized light from a continuous active medium with high quantum efficiency, which is potentially useful for on-chip subwavelength optoelectric applications. 	Active optical devices sometimes involve an interaction between a plane electromagnetic wave and an active optical medium, which interaction can be modulated by an external stimulus, such as optical or electric pumping. The optical non-linearity of active media available in nature is, in general, extremely weak. Therefore, either bulky or highly resonant structures are required to build an effective, active optical device. Artificially engineered material, sometimes referred as a ???metamaterials,??? can have optical properties that are not naturally available. I demonstrate an efficient optical modulator based on a plasmonic metamaterial, which takes advantage of enhanced light-matter interaction within a small-footprint device. Simple modeling and numerical simulation is performed to identify a strong localized field that is due to magnetic resonance. A far-field optical characterization, based on the pump-probe technique, is performed, to demonstrate all-optical modulation with an ultrafast response time of 2 ps and a modulation depth of 40 %...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates how the {{interdisciplinary}} field of Complexity Science can inform both sociological theory and methodological practice. Non-linearity and complexity dynamics such as emergence and positive/negative feedback are central in many social phenomena, but have until recently {{not only been}} hard to grasp though intuition, but {{have been just as}} vexing for our social scientific theories and methods. These phenomena tend to defy deeply ingrained assumptions of regularity, linearity, and proportionality between cause and effect, as seemingly insignificant factors may set off avalanches of change. For instance, {{as in the case of}} Tunisia when the self-immolation of a street vender sparked a range of international revolts. Similarly, personalized memes in social media can spread like global electronic wildfires, reaching millions of people in a matter of hours. Complexity science shows that patterns and system dynamics in complex systems cannot be understood only through the properties of system components, but emerge through the intricate interactions between these components. Complexity science is now a dominant perspective within the natural sciences and has proven useful to analyze complex systems ranging from flocks of birds to the financial market, traffic congestion and emergency evacuations. The fact that complexity dynamics are general and can be found in many scientific fields and disciplines raises some pertinent and intriguing questions. Can complex social systems be approached in a similar way as complex systems in nature? Are methods such as computer simulations also useful within the social realm to investigate how collective patterns emerge from micro-level interactions? Or does the complexity of social systems resist reductionism to lower-levels, thus requiring us to acknowledge the causal power of higher-level social entities and social structures? And perhaps most importantly: can these approaches be combined? This thesis addresses these questions and through four theoretical and empirical studies it explores different approaches to social complexity and show how they can be combined. Paper I critically engages the notion of complexity and introduces a theoretical tool that distinguishes between different types of complexity and charts the relation between systems, problems and methods. The notion of wicked systems is introduced to describe the category most social systems belong to. Paper II focuses on radical societal transitions that are driven by social movements. The paper develops an integrated theoretical framework by combining social movement literature with Transition Studies—an interdisciplinary field that focuses on large scale socio-technical transitions. This conceptual framework builds upon complexity-thinking and focuses on the type of multi-level causality that typically characterizes social change. Paper III develops a computer simulation to investigate the emergent network structural effects of free social spaces on the diffusion of social mobilization, thus illustrating the potential of integrating formal modeling in research on social movements. Paper IV investigates discursive connections between Islamophobia and anti-feminism in a corpus of 50 million posts extracted from an Internet forum. The paper develops a methodological synergy that combines Critical Discourse Analysis and Topic Modeling—a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large amounts of texts. This is complemented with tools from Social Network Analysis to illustrate discursive connections. By employing different approaches to social complexity, each of these studies contributes to answering open issues in its field and thus provides a concrete illustration of how a complexity-based inquiry can inform sociology. By discussing, elaborating and refining various theories and notions, the introductory chapter then provides a re-contextualization of these studies and illustrates how they constitute complementing approaches that can be combined. The main conclusion is that most social systems can be conceptualized as wicked systems: they are open, nebulous systems, characterized by multi-level causation which makes them recalcitrant to formalization and reductionism. This calls for a method-pluralist approach that combines individualist strategies such as computer simulations with process-based frameworks that address multi-level causation and the co-evolution of causal mechanisms on higher levels. This approach to social complexity thus <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of capturing parts of the analytical sociology position, but embedded within a critical realist ontology that acknowledges the social as an emergent reality with its own specific powers. It also offers a contribution to critical realism by enabling us to systematically explore emergent processes. Hence, complexity science furnishes what critical realism lacks by affording both conceptual and technical means to study the emergent interplay between human action and social structure...|$|E
