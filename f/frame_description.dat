40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} the various {{conditions in which}} {{there can be a}} bouncing universe solution in f(R) gravity. In the article an interesting method, to analyze the bouncing FRW solutions in a spatially flat universe using f(R) gravity models using an effective Einstein <b>frame</b> <b>description</b> of the process, is presented. The analysis shows that a cosmological bounce in the f(R) theory need not be described by an equivalent bounce in the Einstein <b>frame</b> <b>description</b> of the process where actually there may be no bounce at all. Nevertheless the Einstein <b>frame</b> <b>description</b> of the bouncing phenomena turns out to be immensely important as the dynamics of the bounce becomes amenable to logic based on general relativistic intuition.

40|$|Whether Jordan's and Einstein's <b>frame</b> <b>descriptions</b> of F(R) {{theory of}} gravity are {{physically}} equivalent, {{is a long}} standing debate.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to rethink the {{relativity}} issue within the framework of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics. The aspect of so-called ``double special relativity'' (DSR) is a starting point in our discussion. The three elementary ideas were involved to show that special relativity may be treated as an integral part of quantum mechanics. These ideas (or observations) are: (1) the necessity of distinguishing the two time meanings, namely: (i) the vital one referring to description of system evolution, and (ii) the frozen one, referring to energy measure by means of inverse time units; (2) the existence of the energy-momentum (and time-distance) comparison scale in relativistic description; and (3) a possibility of introduction of mass by means of a light-cone <b>frame</b> <b>description.</b> The resulting quantum-mechanical analysis allows us to find diagonal form of the Lorentz-boost transformation matrix and thus to relate the interval invariant relativity principle with the principles of quantum mechanics. The manner, in which the diagonal form of the transformation matrix was found, shows that covariant description itself is a preferred <b>frame</b> <b>description</b> and that the time that undergoes relativistic transformation rules is the frozen time, whereas the vital time is the Lorentz invariant. A generalized form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle proposed by Witten (Phys. Today, Apriel 1996), is derived. It turns out, that this form is equivalent to the one know from the analysis of the covariant harmonic oscillator given by Kim and Noz (the book, 1986). As a by-product of this analysis one finds that special relativity itself preserves the Planck length, however, a particle cannot be seen any longer as a material point, but rather as an extended quantum object.

Substitution and adjunction in the syntax then trigger the unification of the associated semantic frames, which are formally defined as base-labelled feature structures. Moreover, the system of elementary constructions is specified in a metagrammar by means of tree and <b>frame</b> <b>descriptions.</b> This metagrammatical factorization gives rise to a fine-grained decomposition of the semantic contributions of syntactic building blocks, and it allows us to separate lexical from constructional contributions and to carve out generalizations across constructions.
