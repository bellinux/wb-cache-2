5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|King of Pop is a {{compilation}} album by American recording artist Michael Jackson released in commemoration of Michael Jackson's 50th birthday. The album differs significantly <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> {{it was released}} because fan voting was employed to determine the songs for each country's version. The album's title comes from the title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years earlier. The album's launch was made public on June 20, 2008, with the official announcement of the Australian version. The first release came with the German edition (which {{is identical to the}} Swiss edition) on August 22, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008 {{the winning}} entry of each contest has been decided by {{a mixture of}} televoting and {{national}} juries, each counting for {{fifty percent of the}} points awarded by each country. The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting. The ten entries that have received the most votes <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> are awarded points ranging from one to eight, then ten and twelve. These points are then announced live during the programme by a spokesperson representing the participating country (who, like the participants, is aged between ten and fifteen). Once all participating countries have announced their results, the country that has received the most points is declared the winner of that year's contest.|$|E
5|$|The American effort {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} soon outstripped the British as the American authorities {{were reluctant to}} share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> with some exchange of information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access {{to all of the}} information available. They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.|$|E

5|$|The {{governing}} bodies <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, {{in which the}} teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At {{the end of a}} season, the top team is declared the champion.

5|$|The {{need for}} {{preschool}} education <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> was assessed through research {{and interviews with}} television producers, researchers, and educational experts, which paralleled what the producers of Sesame Street did in the late 1960s. Then they convened the experts {{in a series of}} meetings, held in the individual countries, to create and develop a curriculum, the show's educational goals, and its set and characters, as was done in 1968 in the US. Finally, they held a series of meetings, both at the CTW offices in New York City and in the individual countries, to train the co-production team in the CTW model. Writing seminars were also held in New York.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ted {{started work}} in February 1961 as an {{assistant}} district attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he first developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime. He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours {{with the goal of}} improving his foreign policy credentials. On a nine-nation Latin American trip in 1961, FBI reports from the time showed Kennedy meeting with Lauchlin Currie, an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers. Reports from the FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour. The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy's foreign policy views, and in subsequent Boston Globe columns he warned that the region might turn to Communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in a more effective way. Kennedy also began speaking to local political clubs and organizations.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{of these shows}} developed them using a variant on the CTW model, a flexible model of production based upon {{the experiences of the}} creators and {{producers of}} the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive test screening of the shows. The shows came to be called co-productions, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending upon each country's needs and resources. They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>country</b> that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, from the South African co-production Takalani Sesame, was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the US show's 40thanniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140countries.|$|E

Hooper scored his second Premier League goal and fourth goal in all competitions in just his seventh start for Norwich City, on 30 November 2013 against Crystal Palace, which Norwich City won 1–0 for a vital 3 points. On 7 December, Hooper scored his fifth Norwich City goal and third Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, a first time angled shot across goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into the corner after a through ball from Leroy Fer, the match ended in a 0–2 Norwich City victory. On 15 December, Hooper scored in consecutive Premier League matches, the one-time Scunthorpe United frontman took one touch on his chest after a Johan Elmander lay off, before hitting a superb volley 30 yards out over Michel Vorm and into the roof of the net, levelling the score at 1–1. Hooper would score again on the Boxing Day fixture against Fulham as his shot deflected off of Aaron Hughes and past goalkeeper David Stockdale, thus making Hooper the first ever Norwich City player to score in four successive Premier League matches at Carrow Road.|$|E
