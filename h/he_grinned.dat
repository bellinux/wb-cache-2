He incurred a compound fracture to his ankle in September 1948 and subsequently the Braves were without their starting left fielder for the 1948 World Series.

500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E

[...] Whereas at the advent of their marriage Maud was very assertive of her authority, Frank was charming and yielding. [...] In a frequently related family tale, Frank bought a dozen bismarks (jelly doughnuts) and took them home. [...] Affronted, Maud enjoined him to tell her whether he disliked the food she purchased and cooked. [...] Frank {{told her that her}} meals were satisfying, but <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> that he also enjoyed to eat Bismarks for breakfast. [...] For three consecutive mornings, she gave him bismarks to eat. [...] Frank, sick of the now stale doughnuts, placed them in the cupboard after bundling them up in newspaper. [...] Taking the doughnuts back from the cupboard, Maud forced him to eat them.|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
