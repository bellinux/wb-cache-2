40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} the question, 2 ̆ 2 How should journalists cover the environment, {{according to the}} conversation between the scholarship on environmental journalism and the <b>handbooks</b> on environmental journalism? 2 ̆ 2 Do the <b>handbooks,</b> written for practicing journalists, agree with the academic scholarship on environmental journalism? The conversation between the literature and <b>handbooks</b> is important to examine, as the <b>handbooks</b> are tools journalists may use when reporting on the environment. The <b>handbooks</b> could influence a journalist, who influences the public, who make decisions in a democracy. As well, examining the conversation between the literature and the <b>handbooks</b> reveals {{whether or not the}} academy and the practice agree on how to respond to the criticisms and challenges of environmental journalism. Do they offer the same tips for improvement? First, an extensive literature review on environmental journalism revealed the criticisms, challenges, and tips to improve. Second, a qualitative document analysis examined <b>handbooks</b> published for journalists covering the environment to capture definitions, meanings, and similarities and differences among them. Third, the results of the literature review and the results of the document analysis were compared to examine if the <b>handbooks</b> respond, emulate, or differ from the literature content. Findings include five qualitative document analyses of the <b>handbooks,</b> and a comparative essay of the <b>handbooks</b> to the scholarly literature. These findings were based on the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s interpretive analysis. The conversation between the literature and <b>handbooks</b> is a healthy one. As the literature presents challenges and criticisms, the <b>handbooks</b> suggest solutions. Most importantly, as the literature presents tips and techniques for improvement, the <b>handbooks</b> agree with the ways to improve. Overall, the scholarship on environmental journalism and the <b>handbooks</b> on environmental journalism are 2 ̆ 2 on the same page. 2 ̆ 2 Both support understanding audience needs, obtaining a solid understanding of a topic before reporting, addressing environmental issues thoroughly, translating the science, providing the history of a topic, addressing risk, using diverse sources, maintaining long-term coverage, disseminating objective information, and more training for journalists...|$|R

40|$|Three <b>handbooks</b> {{have been}} developed, in {{conjunction}} {{with a wide range of}} stakeholders to assist in the management of contaminated food production systems, inhabited areas and drinking water following a radiological incident. The <b>handbooks</b> are aimed at national and local authorities, central government departments and agencies, emergency services, radiation protection experts, the agriculture and food production sectors, industry and others who may be affected. The <b>handbooks</b> include management options for application in the different phases of an incident. Sources of contamination considered in the <b>handbooks</b> include nuclear accidents and radiological dispersion devices; the most relevant radionuclides are included. The <b>handbooks</b> are divided into several sections which provide supporting scientific and technical information; an analysis of the factors influencing recovery; compendia of comprehensive, state-of-the-art datasheets for around 100 management options and guidance on planning in advance. A decision-aiding framework comprising colour coded selection tables, look-up tables and decision trees and several worked examples are also included. The <b>handbooks</b> can be used as a preparatory tool, under non-crisis conditions, to engage stakeholders and to develop local and regional plans. The <b>handbooks</b> can also be applied as part of the decision-aiding process to develop a recovery strategy following an incident. In addition, the <b>handbooks</b> are useful for training purposes and during emergency exercises. To realise their full potential, the <b>handbooks</b> should be customised at national, regional and local levels...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{theories}} of intercultural researchers Michael Agar and Gary P.

In Agar’s and Ferraro’s view, there is insufficient attention for language use in these <b>handbooks.</b> Chapter 1 explores the theoretical background of the topics Culture and Language, Culture and Language Shock, and the topic Culture, Language and Identity. Chapter 2 analyzes the general approach of the five German <b>handbooks</b> for future sojourners. Chapter 3 compares the <b>handbooks</b> with intercultural theory from Agar and Ferraro. The <b>handbooks</b> are analyzed with the aspects Culture and Language, Culture and Language Shock, Culture Language and Identity, Register, Linguistic Styles, and Spoken Language. Finally, an evaluation is made of how well the <b>handbooks</b> can prepare prospective foreign students for their time abroad, and what could be improved...|$|R

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 266 p. The dissertation, "Resisting Handbooks: A Semiotic Analysis of the Genre and the Discipline," presents another way to read <b>handbooks</b> for writing instruction. Using the material that <b>handbooks</b> themselves posit as central to writing instruction and practice, the analysis brings current critical theory to bear upon traditional methods of writing instruction. Reading <b>handbooks</b> in a semiotic way, then, uncovers codes within the <b>handbooks</b> [...] rhetorical, economic, and scientific [...] and suggests that teachers of composition begin to read <b>handbooks</b> against the grain. The call is to "read the world of handbooks," in order to see the layers of ideology that sediment the text. Chapters are devoted to uncovering <b>handbooks</b> as repositories of belief systems, as empirical texts that gain credibility for the discipline, as texts rich in marketing strategies, where rhetoric for writing instruction is also rhetoric that sells. Presentation of thesis statement in <b>handbooks</b> is challenged using Jacques Derrida's notion of exteriority of writing. Choice of subject position, that is, person, is analyzed by use of Roman Jakobsen's understanding of pronouns as "shifters. " Finally, Henry Giroux's resistance theory underpins the approach entertained in the dissertation...|$|R
