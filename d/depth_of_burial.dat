5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} an {{underground}} nuclear test may vary according to factors including the depth and yield of the explosion, {{as well as the}} nature of the surrounding rock. If the test is conducted at sufficient depth, the test is said to be contained, with no venting of gases or other contaminants to the environment. In contrast, if the device is buried at insufficient depth ("underburied"), then rock may be expelled by the explosion, forming a crater surrounded by ejecta, and releasing high-pressure gases to the atmosphere (the resulting crater is usually conical in profile, circular, and may range between tens to hundreds of metres in diameter and depth). One figure used in determining how deeply the device should be buried is the scaled <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> or -burst. This figure is calculated as the burial depth in metres divided by the cube root of the yield in kilotons. It is estimated that, in order to ensure containment, this figure should be greater than 100.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{minutes to}} days later, once the heat dissipates enough, the steam condenses, and the {{pressure}} in the cavity falls below the level needed to support the overburden, the rock above the void falls into the cavity. Depending on various factors, including the yield and characteristics of the burial, this collapse may extend to the surface. If it does, a subsidence crater is created. Such a crater is usually bowl-shaped, and ranges in size from a few tens of metres to over a kilometre in diameter. At the Nevada Test Site, 95 percent of tests conducted at a scaled <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> (SDOB) of less than 150 caused surface collapse, compared with about half of tests conducted at a SDOB of less than 180. The radius r (in feet) of the cavity {{is proportional to the}} cube root of the yield y (in kilotons), r = 55 * an 8 kiloton explosion will create a cavity with radius of 110 feet.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent to}} which finite element models of {{partially}} buried nuclear power plant structures {{may be used to}} compute seismic induced wall pressures is investigated in this paper. Stresses in three dimensional finite elements modeling the soil adjacent to the structure are used and stresses in these elements are used to evaluate wall pressures. <b>Depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> the structure varying from to 1 times the height of the structure are considered. The SASSI computer code is used to perform the analyses. The wall pressures for the shallower <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> are found to depend on the inertial interaction loads, while the pressures for the deeper embedded structures are found to depend on kinematic interaction loads. The input ground motion for the study has a ZPA equal to 0. 3 g. The maximum wall pressures are examined to determine whether non linear effects (separation of the wall and soil or slippage of the soil relative to the wall) are important.

Their quiet tectonic history — with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> never exceeding 200metres, and [...] "no thermal maturation" [...] occurring (Jeppsson 1983) — means that organic material is preserved relatively unscathed, to a degree of quality barely rivalled anywhere else on earth for rocks of this age - indeed, the preservation is equivalent to that expected from the Tertiary (Sherwood-Pike and Gray 1985). Dissolution of the rocks in hydrofluoric acid leaves the organic matter unscathed, and putative fungi (Ornatifilum) and fæcal pellets have been unearthed (Sherwood-Pike and Gray 1985), as well as supposed euglenids (Gray and Boucot 1989): the latter being of particular interest as not one other fossil euglenid is known.

An x-ray backscatter method has been developed with photon detection efficiency sufficiently high such that an electric power requirement of only hundreds of watts yields a soil surface interrogation rate of 1 sq m per minute. Extensive laboratory measurements, and one test on the mine lanes at Fort A. P.

40|$|The Paleo- to Mesoarchaean Barberton granitoid-greenstone {{terrain of}} South Africa {{consists}} of two main components: the low-grade metamorphic supracrustal greenstone sequence of the Barberton greenstone belt {{in the north and}} a high-grade metamorphic granitoid-gneiss terrain to the south. The boundary between the two different domains corresponds to the highly tectonized, amphibolite-facies rocks of the Theespruit Formation that occur along the margins of the greenstone belt. These rocks record high-P, low-T peak metamorphic conditions of 7. 4 ± 1. 0 kbar and 560 ± 20 °C that are very similar to estimates from other areas of the high-grade terrain and were attained during the main phase of terrain accretion in the greenstone belt at 3230 Ma. In contrast, the greenstone sequence ca. 4 km to the north only records low greenschist-facies metamorphism, indicating that a metamorphic break of ca. 18 km exists between the high-grade terrain and the greenstone belt. The main phase of deformation in the Theespruit Formation was initiated under peak metamorphic conditions and continued during retrogression. Retrograde P-T estimates and mineral reactions indicate that retrogression involved near-isothermal decompression of ca. 4 kbar prior to cooling into the greenschist-facies, suggesting that the fabric in these rocks is an exhumation fabric that accommodated the juxtaposition of the high-grade terrain against the greenstone belt. Geochronological constraints, combined with the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> indicate that exhumation of the high-grade rocks occurred at rates of 2 - 5 mm/a and are comparable to the exhumation rates of crustal rocks in younger orogenic environments. The extremely low apparent geothermal gradients of ca. 20 °C/km that are recorded in the high-grade terrain are inconsistent with models of a hotter and weaker crustal environment in the Archaean. Rather, the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> and structural integrity of this terrain suggest that the Mesoarchaean crust was cold and rigid enough to allow tectonic stacking and crustal overthickening and had a rheology similar to modern continental crust. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Well-exposed blueschists also occur in Greece, Turkey, Japan, New Zealand and New Caledonia.Continued subduction of blueschist facies oceanic crust will produce eclogite facies assemblages in metamorphosed basalt (garnet + omphacitic clinopyroxene). Rocks which have been subjected to blueschist conditions during a prograde trajectory will gain heat by conduction with hotter lower crustal rocks if they remain at the 15-18 km depth.

This is in contrast to the ambient high volatile C bituminous coal rank in the region. Low-rank peat-like textures are preserved in the clasts, suggesting that the metamorphism took place soon after deposition of the peat.

Certain areas of this crust experienced anomalously high temperatures due to deep burial, while others did not. This burial has been investigated using optical indicators of organic matter (OM) maturity and clay mineralogy. The maximum <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> Tertiary surface sequences have been established based on the vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and thermal alteration index (TAI) of OM dispersed in synorogenic sediments and from clay mineralogy of pre-thrusting clayey deposits.

The greatest water volumes are produced {{during the early stages}} of production. Environmentally acceptable disposal of brine is a major cost factor for economic methane production. Fresh water may be discharged on the surface, but brine is usually injected into rock at a depth where the salinity of the injected brine is less than connate fluids of the host rock. Evaporation of water for recovery of potentially salable solid residues might be feasible in regions having high evaporation rates.|$|E
