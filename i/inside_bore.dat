Section IV checked and considered the <b>inside</b> <b>boring</b> structure of the Jikokuten and the Zochouten Buddhas(produced around the 10 th century) in the Konin Temple from a wooden sculptor's point of view.

40|$|AbstractSampling stygofauna is {{both time}} {{consuming}} and labour intensive. The {{challenge is to}} get samples from as many bores as possible within a limited time. The essential assumption {{for this is that}} faunal communities <b>inside</b> <b>bores</b> are comparable and representative of the communities outside. To compare relative abundance, taxonomic richness and community composition of the fauna <b>inside</b> groundwater <b>bores</b> to the fauna of the surrounding aquifer, 20 monitoring bores in Palatinate, southwestern Germany, were sampled twice in 1 month. Initially, a sample of 4 l of water was collected from the bottom of each bore. A further sample of 51 l was collected from the groundwater surrounding the bore using a pneumatic piston pump with double packer sampler. Water chemistry inside and outside the bore was similar, but the relative amounts of sediments within the bores were higher compared to those from outside. Relative abundances of fauna <b>inside</b> the <b>bores</b> were higher than in the aquifer, but taxonomic composition was similar {{with the exception of the}} proportions of nematodes and amphipods, which were higher inside. As a result, the proportions of cyclopoids were lower inside. Higher nematode proportions are explained partially by the nearly complete extraction of bore sediment. A “habitat heterogeneity effect” states that in heterogeneous aquifers with few suitable habitats, faunal distribution is supposed to be extremely patchy. Thus, detritus accumulates in bores, attracting animals and providing “habitat islands” in the groundwater. This effect could explain the higher amphipode proportions <b>inside</b> the <b>bores,</b> which were generally more frequently populated than the surrounding groundwater. As a consequence, fauna is thought to be nearly absent from groundwater, where suitable habitats are lacking. In those sparsely populated aquifers, samples representative of the aquifer taxonomic richness and composition can only be collected by removing large volumes of water, or by sampling the bottom of bores. These findings also suggest that the use of unbaited colonisation chambers or traps in the groundwater, which are comparable with bores, would seem to be a promising approach...|$|R

Together, these characteristics make for a visibly and audibly raw and organic instrument. Hotchiku are sometimes referred to as jinashi nobekan, meaning [...] "without ji (a paste made of clay and lacquer, used to smooth the bore on modern shakuhachi), one-piece" [...] (hotchiku are not cut in two pieces for crafting or storage, unlike modern shakuhachi that are used as musical instruments).|$|E

50|$|Polyvinyl {{siloxane}} (PVS), {{also called}} poly-vinyl siloxane, vinyl polysiloxane, or vinylpolysiloxane, is an addition-reaction silicone elastomer (an addition silicone). It is a viscous liquid that cures ("dries") quickly into a rubber-like solid, taking {{the shape of}} whatever surface it was lying against while curing. As with 2-part epoxy, its package keeps its 2 component liquids in separate tubes until the moment they are mixed and applied, because once mixed, they cure (harden) rapidly. Polyvinyl siloxane is widely used in dentistry as an impression material. It is also used in other contexts where an impression similar to a dental impression is needed, such as in audiology (to take ear impressions for fitting custom hearing protection or hearing aids) or in industrial applications (such as {{to aid in the}} inspection of interior features of machined parts, for example, internal grooves <b>inside</b> <b>bores).</b> Polyvinyl siloxane was commercially introduced in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to rescue of trapped child in to the boar well by {{continues}} monitoring & supply of necessary items to survive using technical method. These bore wells in turn have started to take many innocent lives. Bores which yielded water and subsequently got depleted are left uncovered. Small children without noticing the hole dug for the bore well slip in and get trapped. To aid in such rescue we have proposed a system. The Methods to keep a child alive in a bore should take in to consideration the lack of oxygen, increased temperatures and humidity, which produces hyperthermia. These problems are addressed with fresh air delivery with or without oxygen. A hand-powered equipment to deliver fresh air <b>inside</b> <b>bore</b> is being designed. This method brings down temperature and delivers fresh air. Visualizing the child is made possible with infrared waterproof cameras and a portable high resolution TV Monitor. This is light weight machine that will go down into the bore well pipe and save the child life systematically. This machine will go down the bore well and perform the action.

40|$|A tool was {{developed}} to repair or replace AN fittings on the shuttle external tank (ET). (The AN thread {{is a type of}} fitting used to connect flexible hoses and rigid metal tubing that carry fluid. It is a U. S. military-derived specification agreed upon by the Army and Navy, hence AN.) The tool is used on a drill and is guided by a pilot shaft that follows the <b>inside</b> <b>bore.</b> The cutting edge of the tool is a standard-size replaceable insert. In the typical Post Launch Maintenance/Repair process for the AN fittings, the six fittings are removed from the ET's GUCP (ground umbilical carrier plate) for reconditioning. The fittings are inspected for damage to the sealing surface per standard operations maintenance instructions. When damage is found on the sealing surface, the condition is documented. A new AN reconditioning tool is set up to cut and remove the surface damage. It is then inspected to verify the fitting still meets drawing requirements. The tool features a cone-shaped interior at 36. 5, and may be adjusted at a precise angle with go-no-go gauges to insure that the cutting edge could be adjusted as it wore down. One tool, one setting block, and one go-no-go gauge were fabricated. At the time of this reporting, the tool has reconditioned/returned to spec 36 AN fittings with 100 -percent success of no leakage. This tool provides a quick solution to repair a leaky AN fitting. The tool could easily be modified with different-sized pilot shafts to different-sized fittings...|$|E

The force and torque applied by a 3. 0 -tesla scanner on an ultrasonic motor are not fully known.
