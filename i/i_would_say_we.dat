40|$|The {{dictionary}} {{tells you}} that a shadow is a dark area or volume caused by an opaque object blocking some light. The definition is correct, {{but we need to}} clarify a couple of its elements: darkness and blocking. Regarding darkness we should note two things. One is that a shadow {{does not need to be}} pure darkness; depending on the circumstances, a shadow can be darker or lighter in absolute terms. The second thing to note is that a shadow to exist at a certain location does not always require a contrast with lighter areas surrounding it. Such a contrast is required in order to see a shadow, but not for the shadow to exist as such. To illustrate this point, consider the shadow cast by a box on a white wall. Suppose we painted the area on the wall surrounding the shadow in a color that exactly matches the darkness of the shadow. Did we render the shadow invisible? Yes, it is not visually identifiable. But did we annihilate it? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> did not. As far as ontology goes, the cast shadow is simply the absence of light on a certain surface as a result of its being blocked by an opaque object, or, in other words, as a result of an opaque object standing between the light source and the surface.

Nevertheless, we are no doubt both so attuned {{to the sound of the}} saxophone that it would not be easy to fool either of us into believing that a real instrument is being played if in reality the sound of the instrument had been electronically synthesized. Certain instruments are easier to synthesize than others. For instance, it is hard even for sensitive ears to distinguish between a genuine church organ and a church-organ sound coming out of a good synthesizer. This is partly because the sound quality of the organ is not dependent on the organist: a two-year-old child who presses an organ key achieves no better or worse sound quality with that key than the most gifted organist. On the other hand, a synthesized solo saxophone (like most synthesized instruments) tends to have a certain unnatural, mechanical quality which is difficult to pin-point but which to the saxophonist immediately rings false. It was therefore with astonishment that I recently listened to two solo saxophone pieces, one played on a real tenor saxophone by a top-flight jazz saxophonist, the other the result of some keyboard input and clever programming by computer scientists who may well have had only a rudimentary knowledge of music and perhaps no playing skills whatsoever. I was quite unable to say which of the two was synthesized even after repeated listenings. The fact is that the perceived perfection achieved by a professional saxophonist is not perfection at all but an amalgam of skill, flexible reactions and numerous little human errors, and provided that this skill, these reactions and these errors can be identified and quantified - clearly, they can - they can all be coded so that the result is perceived perfection. In short, perceived perfection in instrumental synthesis seems to be merely a matter of how long a programmer is willing to spend on fine-tuning the program code...|$|E
40|$|Cue: In Zimbabwe, {{three years}} of poor {{rainfall}} have had a devastating effect on crop yields. Many are attributing the shortage of good rains {{to the process of}} global warming, raising fears about the long-term future of agriculture in the country, and indeed the region. In response, the government is trying to raise awareness of the relationship that exists between people and their environment. Dumisani Nyoni, a senior agricultural extension officer for Matabeleland North province, spoke to Busani Bafana about the climatic changes affecting Zimbabwe and how the government?s programmes and policies are addressing these changes. IN:		?We seem to note that? OUT:		?guiding all the processes involved? DUR?N	 4 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dumisani Nyoni of Zimbabwe?s agricultural extension service. Transcript Nyoni	We seem to note that there is a decline in rainfall received annually. There is also a decline in terms {{of the quality of the}} rainfall season; that is the spread of rainfall over the season, such that you might receive a lot of rain within a short space of time, but unfortunately the distribution is poor. We have also noticed that there is an increase of temperatures, that is also affecting, during the dry spells, the survival of the crops. Bafana	Would you say the farmers have started changing their farming methods in line with the climatic changes? Nyoni	The tendency now is to move away from the traditional cropping system, which was maize based, to production of sorghum, production of pearl millets, cowpeas, groundnuts, crops that can grow with about 350 mm of rain. But of course what still needs to change, and change drastically, are our food preferences, because we might be growing sorghum or pearl millet, but few of our farmers in this area have a preference now for that food. But traditionally these were always the crops that were being grown. Bafana	Would you then say the extension services are addressing the issues of climatic change? Nyoni	We have weekly radio programmes that are looking at the seasonal forecast in terms of rainfall, and we have also now ten day forecasts, which indicate what temperatures will be like, that indicate what rainfall is likely to be received within that particular week or ten day period. What then happens is that as we broadcast these programmes to farmers, we have begun a process of making farmers aware of the impact of the weather on their cropping programmes, or their agricultural programmes. Bafana	For some farmers, the issue of climate change comes no doubt as a shock. Would you say you have encountered any major problems in trying to address this issue? Nyoni	Farmers are realising that there are changes taking place. It is only maybe that the process of discussing climate or global change issues in our region is still behind the international pace as it were. But farmers are realising that there are changes taking place, and probably the more we intensify environmental education, encompassing global change issues, I think farmers will begin to appreciate more and more, what they are contributing to environmental change, and how the environmental change is impacting on their lives. Bafana	And would you say there are any success stories? Nyoni	<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> are moving in the right direction, in the sense that once farmers begin to appreciate that the natural resources management in their areas has an impact is terms of the quality of season they get, that is a step forward. Although unfortunately the limiting factor is poverty; farmers are beginning to realise that the moment you cut down or degrade the environment, it is bound to come back and haunt you, in terms of the rainfall you receive, in terms of the effectiveness of the rainfall you receive, and in terms of what agricultural practices you can perform on the ground. So this is a process that needs both education and also addressing issues of poverty, because the hungry man will not listen to reason, because he or she wants to fulfil the immediate need, that of food, first. Bafana	And lastly Mr. Nyoni, Zimbabwe has made great strides in actually changing the Environmental Act, in order to address several environmental issues, which I believe one of them is climatic change. What impact will the changes in the Act have? Nyoni	Having this Environmental Act in place will have a positive impact in terms of natural resources management in the country. What we need to do now, is educate and engage communities in thorough discussions, so that they see how they contribute to environmental change, how they need to contribute to environmental management, so that at the end of the day we produce whatever we produce on a sustainable basis. It?s going to be an engaging process that requires a lot of resources, and a lot of time. And we need to go into schools, we need to go into farming communities, with this message. But what is good about this Environmental Act, is that all government departments, all non-governmental organisations that have a part to play in environmental management issues, are going to go to the people, to the stakeholders, with one voice, with one Act guiding all the processes involved.

40|$|Promoting {{fruit tree}} {{cultivation}} Cue: While the planting {{of trees in}} homesteads and crop land is a traditional practice in many areas, in other places it is a more recent innovation. And even though the benefits of trees on farms are now widely recognised, organisations that aim to spread agroforestry techniques still have to plan their approach carefully. In Botswana, for example, an NGO called the Forestry Association has, since 1983, been working to reverse the destruction of natural woodland. One recent project has been the promotion of fruit trees on homesteads. But getting a ?new? technology like this widely accepted has required the organisation to work through local chiefs and through schools, as well as offering incentives to the farmers themselves. Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Association spoke to Busani Bafana about the work. IN:		?Farmers like to develop. ? OUT:		?. acquired from primary level and secondary level. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Forestry Association of Botswana, was talking to Busani Bafana. Transcript Motoma 	Farmers like to develop but then the question sometimes is the practicability of those methods whether {{they can afford to}} do that. Taking into consideration that the land which they have been given are just small plots, but they would need a larger chunk in its entirety. Unless they come together as communities in woodland management projects - be it agroforestry or anything - but when they come together then they can be able to get larger chunks of land to manage sustainably. Busani	You have talked about the challenge that has faced your Association, in effect promoting a fully fledged agroforestry. But you have recorded some successes in planting indigenous trees even for orchards. Tell us briefly about that. Motoma	I wouldn?t say for orchards, that is a big thing. But the other thing that we have done which is still in the line of agroforestry is the homestead one, where people planted trees in their own homesteads. They would plant three indigenous species, one of which would be a fruit tree and they would plant two exotic species, one of which would be a fruit tree. And in that way, that was the agroforestry of the home, which would also provide shade, it would provide some form of firewood, it would also provide some form of soil fertility. We are encouraging Batswana people to plant the indigenous species so that they can maximise the benefits from them. The benefits mainly being that they don?t have to water them as much, they are frost resistant when they are in their right environment. They can withstand the termites, the poor nutrition of the soil also is OK for them because they sink their roots quite deep. They can also stand the drought because they tap water from quite deep. So that?s basically what we are encouraging the farmers, even at their homes, to do. We are not only limiting ourselves to big farmers; even the upcoming ones in schools we are also targeting and we are encouraging all the facets of agroforestry in the schools, and also targeting the teachers to teach agroforestry as they teach their agriculture curricula. Busani	I notice in the summary of the Association?s performance you indicate that to date we have planted indigenous trees in the 64 villages in approximately 7, 250 households through the Home Tree Planting Programme. How easy has this been to get the involvement of the communities? Motoma	<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> were successful because we approached it the traditional way. We went through the chiefs and we used the Kotla system. The Kotla system is where the local gathering area that is called by the chief. So that is how we would come in. And people would embrace this around the home tree planting, and then that?s when we would discuss on how best to do it. And that is how we have been successful. Although since people didn?t quite believe so much in indigenous tree planting, at the beginning when they started they would take care more of the exotic species than the indigenous. But because we also had incentives for those who had 100 % or 80 % survival some would just go along so that they get those incentives, which were two grafted citrus fruits. And because they wanted that they would take care of the indigenous species as well. And in that way since the indigenous species would only need that one year to be taken care of, then they would get established and thereafter need not much attention. And that?s how we have managed to succeed. But we lost out on those who were sceptical at the beginning or the laggards who would come after everybody else had gone because by the time they came we had already passed to another village. We wouldn?t go back to the same village the same time. This is one thing that we have learnt that in future we will have to stay in one area for more than a year. Busani	And what does the future hold? What do you hope to do in the future as far as expanding your programmes? Motoma	We still have a lot to do. We {{need to go back to}} communities and get them together because that?s the way to go now. And on agroforestry encourage the inter-cropping of horticulture, trees, both exotic and indigenous because we can?t cast out the exotic trees, there are those ones which are good. We would also like to move aggressively into soil conservation and addressing the energy issue of using fuel wood because now people are cutting live trees for fuel wood and that is very bad for a fragile environment like Botswana. We also would like to continue with the schools - to target primary schools, to target secondary schools so that they grow up with the knowledge of planting trees, of agroforestry and all the interventions of woodland management or environmental management. So that even when they grow up wherever they go to work, whatever career they choose, they would have that basic knowledge in them, having been acquired from primary level and secondary level. End of track. Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Forestry Association of Botswana explains how her organisation is promoting fruit tree cultivation...|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} fun, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> our first record and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that because <b>we</b> didn't care. I mean, there was {{absolutely}} no thought, there was no revision; we were a local band and we just wrote music that didn't make sense and it doesn't go together at all, so that was definitely the easiest one to do, because we didn't really give a crap what it sounded like. - Jeremy McKinnon, upon being asked which album was the most fun to record, 2011 According to McKinnon, And Their Name Was Treason was recorded [...] "probably within 3 days", in Andrew Wade's bedroom at his parents house (credited in the album booklet as The Wade Studio). The members later said they had [...] "no idea" [...] what were they doing when they were recording the album. The album features samples from various films throughout; [...] "Intro" [...] features a sample from the film Donnie Darko, [...] "1958" [...] features a sample from the film The Boondock Saints and [...] "Sound the Alarm" [...] features audio from Shaun of the Dead. Speaking about the lyrical themes on the record, guitarist Tom Denney said that they were [...] "all experiences that singer Jeremy has had, its all based on life".|$|R
5000|$|With the {{continuous}} impact growth of ICT to the world, {{a lot of}} other improvement opportunities in the development sectors emerged. In this Information Age, information is considered great source of wealth which prompted development planners to invest in ICT projects. This give birth to different applications for the development sector. However, some of them are considered non appropriate technology. As mentioned in the module, [...] "How can one talk about connectivity in rural areas when electricity itself is lacking? How can one assume computer literacy when functional literacy is a problem?" [...] Thus, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>we</b> haven't fully maximized the benefits we can get from ICT because of other problems that are already present in other factors that would affect ICT's functionality and effectiveness. Just like what's mentioned above, the initial problem in some rural areas is electricity which must be fixed first before connectivity in that specific area can be accomplished. Same goes with functional literacy problem before thinking of teaching computer literacy. These initial problems must be fixed first to effectively execute ICT applications. For instance in the Philippines, I believe we must improve the speed of our connectivity in the National Capital Region first, before we can help people in remote areas. ICT has a lot to offer. We just need to work hard on getting all that we can get from it by starting from the bottom - fixing what needs to fixed first before creating something that will not be use because of unfixed initial problems. Just like in other aspects in life, [...] "first things first".|$|R
40|$|Cloned {{animals are}} often {{understood}} as 'models' whose embodiments demonstrate {{the viability of}} somatic cell nuclear transfer and its applicability to a species body. In conceptualizing models through the trope of technoscience, Evelyn Fox Keller has argued that scientific models are not simply cognitive representations of something else, but are also embodiments of action and practice that constitute the kinds of scientific questions that can be asked and how those questions can be answered. Drawing on Keller's language, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that, while <b>we</b> understand cloned animals as 'models of' somatic cell nuclear transfer, little empirical scholarship has explored what these animals are 'models for'. This article asks what practices cloned animals embody, focusing on endeavours to clone endangered wildlife in the United States. Based on a multi-sited, ethnographic study, I show that these animals are models for conducting science in zoological parks, which entails questions regarding the kinds of knowledge practices that {{should be used to}} reproduce zoos and, in turn, meaningfully reconstitute wildlife. Based on this analysis, I contend that cloned animals not only model technique and scientific practices, but also new assemblages in the reproduction of zoos and, in turn, nature...|$|R
