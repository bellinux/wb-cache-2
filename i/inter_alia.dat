5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a local union was dismissed in Thailand.

5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966.

The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal.

The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E
