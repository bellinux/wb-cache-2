25|$|A {{hearing aid}} is an electro-acoustic body-worn {{apparatus}} which typically fits in or behind the wearer's ear, {{and is designed}} to amplify and modulate sounds for the wearer.

25|$|Most, if not all, of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra {{were known}} of <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> other before Kepler. A small stellated dodecahedron {{appears in a}} marble tarsia (inlay panel) {{on the floor of}} St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, Italy. It dates from the 15th century and is {{sometimes}} attributed to Paolo Uccello. In his Perspectiva corporum regularium (Perspectives of the regular solids), a book of woodcuts published in the 16th century, Wenzel Jamnitzer depicts the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron. It is clear from the general arrangement of the book that he regarded only the five Platonic solids as regular.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} courts-martial were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, {{and another}} at San Ángel on 26 August. At {{neither of these}} trials were the men represented by lawyers nor were transcripts made of the proceedings. This lack of formal legal advice {{could account for the}} fact that several of the men claimed that drunkenness had led them to desert (a common defense in military trials at the time that sometimes led to lighter sentences), and others described how they were forced to join the Mexican Army <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> another. The majority of the San Patricios either offered no defense or their defenses were not recorded. Wealthy Mexicans came to the San Patricios' defence at the trials, and members of Mexico's first families visited them in prison.|$|E
25|$|Official {{records of}} mining {{in the area}} go back {{at least as far}} as 1898. Before that it is likely, due to the {{particularly}} craggy nature of the valley, that the local dry stone walls and stone for housing were taken from the slopes around the valley, even as far back as the Bronze Age. There are two main open cast mines in the valley. The first is Jumb Quarry, situated within a few hundred yards of the early settlement at Tongue House, suggesting that the two may have been coexisting <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> other. However the general proliferation of rock in this part of Kentmere means the early inhabitants may easily have taken their building material from almost anywhere in the valley, so it is by no means certain.|$|E

50|$|Planned {{ignoring}} is {{a strategy}} where a person gives no outward sign of recognizing a behavior, such as no eye contact, no verbal response and no physical response to the person seeking attention.

Interracial marriage and cultural assimilation often prevent the formation a precise definition of Chinese Indonesians in line with any simple racial criterion. Use of a Chinese surname, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> circumstance, is generally a sign of cultural self-identification as ethnic Chinese or alignment with a Chinese social system.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{perceived}} as an upbeat one that leaves listeners with a happy feeling. It is described as having catchy riffs and exuberant vocals that characterized the essence of Cubs fandom while, noting in the lyrics, [...] "You can catch it all on WGN." [...] (That particular lyric is now partially out of date, as WGN radio, which had carried Cubs games <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> another since 1925, gave up the radio rights to the Cubs in 2015 to CBS Radio.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to Newman's idea of Quatermass as {{the embodiment of}} humanity, writer and lecturer Peter Hutchings in his essay [...] "We are the Martians" [...] sees Quatermass as an isolated character. [...] "In the 1950s Quatermass stories, Quatermass himself is someone who, while working to protect the nation, remains a curiously isolated figure, bereft of anything resembling a meaningful relationship. (In the 1979 Quatermass, he has acquired a granddaughter; possibly connected with this is the fact that here he seems a much weaker figure who can only defeat the aliens through the sacrifice of the lives of both himself and his granddaughter)." [...] Hutchings also compared this to American productions of the era: [...] "The standard, if not clichéd, figures of the clean-cut square-jawed hero and his girl, which are present <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> other in most US sf films of this period... are absent." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{over three}} decades, Victor has been romantically linked with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Nikki was {{originally}} {{from the lower}} walks of life, having been a stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. They {{fall in love and}} have a child, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and later a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the soap opera media. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed their characters to marry and divorce or depart from each other <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> fashion in a continuous cycle, which is a take on the original supercouple formula. Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact, described as an [...] "inspired decision", led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple. In an interview with Dose magazine, Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge.|$|E

2500|$|... {{there is}} still a {{considerable}} gulf between hedge witches and cunning-folk, not only in relation to the unbewitching trade, but also from a religious point of view.

Hedge witches, on the other hand, are mostly pagans <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>form</b> <b>or</b> other. They worship nature and have an animistic conception of the physical environment. This, in turn, is mirrored in the content of the spells and charms they use.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the realm}} of theory, the first {{appearance}} of fractals in cosmology was likely with Andrei Linde’s [...] "Eternally Existing Self-Reproducing Chaotic Inflationary Universe" [...] theory (see Chaotic inflation theory), in 1986.

[...] Alan Guth's 2007 paper on [...] "Eternal Inflation and its implications" [...] shows that this variety of Inflationary universe theory is still being seriously considered today.
