50|$|In 2007, {{they were}} invited by the Vulgaires Machins {{for a series}} of shows across the {{beautiful}} province. With Akuma also on the bill, the tour was spread throughout February, March and April. And, although every show was sick, the one at Metropolis in Montreal stuck out the most. In April, The Motions came out in Japan on One Big Family Records, and the band was invited {{to the land of the}} Samurai for a tour. Despite the language barrier and huge cultural shock, it was one of the band's best tour ever. Packed shows, incredible fans, and treated like kings by One Big Family records. November also saw the video for “The Factories” become “Buzzclip” at Musique Plus and receive an <b>exceptional</b> <b>visibility.</b> It has also lingered in the daily top 5 for weeks.|$|E
50|$|The Topolino {{was one of}} the {{smallest}} cars in the world {{at the time of its}} production. Launched in 1937, three models were produced until 1955, all with only minor mechanical and cosmetic changes. It was equipped with a 569 cc four-cylinder, side-valve, water-cooled engine mounted in front of the front axle, (later an overhead valve motor) and so was a full-scale car rather than a cyclecar. The radiator was located behind the engine which made possible a lowered aerodynamic nose profile at a time when competitors had a flat, nearly vertical grille. The shape of the car's front allowed <b>exceptional</b> forward <b>visibility.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Following combat {{experience}} the P-51D series introduced a [...] "teardrop", or [...] "bubble", canopy to rectify problems with poor visibility {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. In America, new moulding techniques had been developed to form streamlined nose transparencies for bombers. North American designed a new streamlined plexiglass canopy for the P-51B which was later developed into the teardrop shaped bubble canopy. In late 1942, the tenth production P-51B-1-NA was removed from the assembly lines. From the windshield aft the fuselage was redesigned by cutting down the rear fuselage formers to the same height as those forward of the cockpit; the new shape faired in to the vertical tail unit. [...] A new simpler style of windscreen, with an angled bullet-resistant windscreen mounted on two flat side pieces improved the forward view while the new canopy resulted in <b>exceptional</b> all-round <b>visibility.</b> Wind tunnel tests of a wooden model confirmed that the aerodynamics were sound.|$|R

5000|$|Since 2012 {{there has}} been a special {{facility}} on the Kalmit for measuring visibility; its task is to record visibility in the Palatine Forest-North Vosges Biosphere Reserve. Whilst at many, unmanned, weather stations, visibility measurements are made automatically for the range 0 to 10 km which is relevant to traffic safety, the measurement station on the Kalmit is designed for the range 10 to 390 km, which is relevant in assessing the fine dust content of the air. Measurements and survey photographs are obtainable through the [...] "Fern-Sehen Project" [...] (Projekt Fern-Sehen) in the Palatine Forest, which is managed by the House of Sustainability in Johanniskreuz, a department of the Rhineland-Palatinate State Forestry Commission. Another feature is that the values were introduced to alert nature lovers, because <b>exceptional</b> <b>visibility</b> is very rare and difficult to forecast.|$|E
30|$|Fame, {{popularity}} and celebrity status, frequently used tokens of success, are often loosely related to, or even divorced from professional performance.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{the last}} decades, the {{initiatives}} implemented under the conceptual umbrella of Harm Reduction have gained momentum, with a vigor and scope (both from a geographic and social perspective) never seen before. A more balanced reevaluation {{could and should}} rather say such initiatives have resumed, to a large extent, ideas and actions launched much earlier, in {{the first decades of}} the 20 th century. Notwithstanding, the dissemination of HIV/AIDS in recent years conferred an <b>exceptional</b> <b>visibility</b> and legitimacy to proposals formerly viewed as subsidiary or openly neglected. Nowadays, initiatives inspired by the Harm Reduction philosophy have faced an "identity crisis", not secondary (according to our perspective) to challenges faced by its concepts and operations, but rather as consequence of a world in a turmoil. Such fast-changing dynamics have reconfigured both drug scenes and the patterns and prospects of HIV/AIDS worldwide. This article briefly summarizes some of such recent, ongoing, changes, which have been deeply affecting both concepts and practices to the point of asking for a deep reformulation of most of the initiatives implemented so far...|$|E
50|$|At the 1957 London Motor Show Vauxhall {{presented}} radically new Velox and Cresta models: {{these would}} {{come to be known}} as the PA versions, being the first of the P series. Particularly eye catching was the new wrap-around windscreen; combined with a three part rear window it created an airy passenger cabin providing <b>exceptional</b> all round <b>visibility.</b> The back of the Velox was graced by tail fins, a Detroit inspired trend already taken up by the car's Ford rival, and which would in the next two years be followed also by UK rival BMC, and such European competitors as Fiat, and Peugeot. On the inside the new Velox also followed US practice of combining a front bench seat with a column-shift gear lever, continuing a trend that dates back to the first Velox models of 1948. Velox models were also assembled at the General Motors Holden plants throughout Australia, and the General Motors New Zealand plant in Petone, north of Wellington. The Wyvern was replaced by the new Victor model line which was also built in the New Zealand. Specially engineered versions of the Velox were built for use by the NZ Traffic Police.|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that the visibility of archaeological sites is largely influenced by their structural properties (e. g. large vs. small sites, low vs. high density sites) and post-depositional processes (e. g. organic vs. inorganic material, surface sites vs. deeply stratified sites). Although archaeologists are aware of this representation problem, {{it can be argued}} that during the history of our discipline, certain periods and regions have received repeatedly more attention than others, precisely because of their <b>exceptional</b> archaeological <b>visibility</b> (e. g. surface sites, wetland sites, large sites, architecturally elaborated sites, etc.). Consequently, site distribution maps on a regional or supra-regional scale do not always simply reflect representative ‘patterns of the past’, but can be seriously biased by the ‘research intensity of the present’ or/and regional differences in preservation and the ease of detection of sites (taphonomical factors). Again, although archaeologists are aware of this ‘modern’ bias in representation, the difference between well and lesser known regions and periods did and still does, often implicitly, influence our interpretations (e. g. a ‘crisis’ for a less investigated period, a ‘golden era’ for a well investigated period; climatic explanations for over- or underrepresentation, economic importance or a ‘demographic boom’ for well documented areas and phases, migrationist explanations for the ‘appearance’ of a well documented phase, etc.). It can thus be argued that a growing awareness of the problem of archaeological representation on the macro-scale has not always led to an equivalent change on the interpretational level. This session wishes to address this conundrum and compare how archaeologists cope with it. For example, the implementation of the Valetta treaty resulted recently in a serious expansion of the scale and intensification of archaeological research in many European countries. The related use of a more random and often methodologically more thought-out sampling strategy smoothed out some ‘historical’ representation biases on the macro-scale. However, does it suffice to simply change our methodologies in order to alter the traditional interpretations based on earlier representation biases? Or are there other ways of coping with this problem? Can new distribution maps change traditional grand narratives based on older ones? Or are academic power structures stronger than a flood of new ‘dots on a map’?status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the human visual system (HVS) is not a camera; the eye-retina-brain {{combination}} does not simply record a visual scene the way a movie camera or video camera does. Instead, the HVS processes the image in a series of steps of increasing abstraction. At each step some information about the scene may be lost and replaced by a higher level of representation. Thus, the HVS is remarkably insensitive to the loss of certain kinds of information in an image scene. Conversely, since the HVS has evolved to detect meaningful patterns, it is exceptionally sensitive to certain image characteristics, a case in point being vernier acuity. Vernier acuity refers to the ability of the HVS to estimate relative displacements between lines or other image features to a resolution much finer than the spacing between the rods or cones in the fovea [FAHLE 1981]. Vernier hyperacuity accounts for the <b>exceptional</b> <b>visibility</b> of "jaggies", the ragged line appearance of lines drawn on a computer display without proper antialiasing [MONTALVO 1979]...|$|E
30|$|While {{we would}} like to believe that fame, {{visibility}} and popularity are uniquely determined by performance, representing well-deserved recognition for some sustained or singular achievement, a significant body of media research indicates otherwise, suggesting that fame follows patterns on its own, divorced from talent or performance [8 – 22]. Here we aimed to quantify the relationship between performance and popularity in an area where these two quantities can be individually measured. We did so by constructing a model to predict a tennis player’s visibility captured by his Wikipedia page-views, a proxy of the athlete’s popularity and fame. Taken together, we find that in tennis a player’s popularity and momentary visibility are uniquely determined by his performance on the court. The agreement is especially good for elite players. This indicates that for athletes exceptional performance offers <b>exceptional</b> <b>visibility,</b> a level that is hard to modulate by exogenous events. For less accomplished players we observe deviations from the performance-predicted popularity, suggesting that in this case visibility can be manipulated by exogenous events or personal attributes outside of the scope of sports performance. It is comforting, however, that for most outliers the extra visibility can be explained by performance factors not considered in our model, like achievements in doubles or junior tournaments. In short, the better the performance of an athlete, the more accurately it determines his popularity, and the lesser the role of exogenous factors. Finally, we find that the fame of retired players is also determined by their past performance, indicating that exceptional past performance can lead to a commensurate lasting legacy.|$|E
