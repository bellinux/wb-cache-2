25|$|The crusaders {{captured}} Acre on 11 July 1191. On 28 July, Richard of England and Philip of France {{agreed that}} <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> retain {{the title of}} king {{till the end of}} his life, but Conrad would rule Tyre, Beirut and Sidon; after Guy's death, the kingdom would be united under the rule of Conrad and Isabella or their issue. Three days later, Philip of France left for France and Richard of England became the sole supreme commander of the crusaders. The native barons remained hostile towards Guy. After Richard decided to return to England in April 1192, the barons urged him to revise the previous decision about the Kingdom of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|After {{a couple}} of years, his skill began {{attracting}} other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this <b>guy</b> <b>could</b> fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{argued that}} [...] "the film is {{definitely}} not anti-American" [...] and that [...] "part of being an American is having the freedom to have dissenting ideas." [...] A critic for MTV concurred that [...] "it'd take a great leap of logic to tag 'Avatar' as anti-American or anti-capitalist." [...] Ann Marlowe called the film [...] "the most neo-con movie ever made" [...] for its [...] "deeply conservative, pro-American message". [...] But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that [...] "the bad <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be America in this movie, or the good <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be America in this movie, depending on your perspective", and stated that Avatars defeat at the Academy Awards might {{have been due to}} the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.|$|R
5000|$|The Journal {{newspaper}} {{described their}} music as [...] "sublime bliss" [...] while the National Student Magazine described them as [...] "coming {{on like a}} cross between Joanna Newsom fronting an unplugged Cocteau Twins" [...] and that [...] "these <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be your new favourite band within five minutes".|$|R

500|$|Three {{days before}} the season's premiere, Mel B made {{comments}} about the other judges, labelling them dishonest and boring. She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is modeled}} after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is {{intended}} to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. As {{is the case with}} his other friends and classmates, Stan is frequently at odds with Cartman, resenting Cartman's behavior and openly mocking his weight. Stan also shares a close friendship with Kenny, while Kenny professes that Stan is one of [...] "the best friends a <b>guy</b> <b>could</b> have". Stan can understand Kenny's muffled voice perfectly, and typically exclaims the catchphrase [...] "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!", following one of Kenny's trademark deaths, allowing Kyle to follow up with [...] "You bastards!" [...] Stan is the only character in the group to have had a steady girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger, and their relationship was a recurring topic in the show's earlier seasons. Despite reconciling and declaring to be a couple again in the season 11 (2007) episode [...] "The List" [...] after Wendy had dumped him in the season seven (2003) episode [...] "Raisins", their relationship has received relatively less focus in recent seasons. As a running gag, a nervous Stan often vomits whenever Wendy approaches to kiss or speak to him. In many episodes, Stan contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral dilemmas, and contentious issues, and will often reflect on the lessons he has attained with a speech that often begins with [...] "You know, I learned something today...".|$|E
2500|$|Boyzone {{released}} {{a brand new}} single, [...] "Love You Anyway", followed by a new compilation album in October 2008. December 2008 saw {{the release of a}} second new single, [...] "Better". The video for the song generated controversy, as scenes depicting romantic couples included a shot of two men embracing, in an inclusive nod to Gately's homosexuality. The group unanimously agreed that Gately should be allowed to pair with a male actor. It was condemned by, among others, the minister of the Dromore Reformed Presbyterian Church. Others, however, cite that milestone as among the reasons why Gately is a [...] "gay rights hero". Wrote Tim Teeman of the Times Online, [...] "Gately showed that an unflamboyant <b>guy</b> <b>could</b> be a pop star and gay...the real shame should be reserved for those managers and showbusiness power-brokers who practise that kind of discrimination, and also maintain the closet, to line their pockets." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{in-depth}} review in 2010, Splitsider concluded that JJGO was [...] "a funny and subscription-worthy podcast {{that the new}} <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> all learn a lot from", and LA Weekly included the show in a [...] "comedy podcast flow-chart", implicitly describing listening to Jordan, Jesse, Go! as [...] "feeling like you're at a party with hilarious comics doing bits all night".|$|R

2500|$|After NBC was {{finished}} with their post-1994 All-Star Game six-week baseball coverage, ABC (with a reunited Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer {{as the primary}} crew) then picked up where NBC left off by televising six more regular season games. Joining the team of Michaels, McCarver, and Palmer was Lesley Visser, {{who served as the}} lead field reporter for the CBS' baseball coverage from 1990-1993. Visser was reuniting with McCarver, for whom she had worked with on CBS. The regular season games fell under the Baseball Night in America umbrella which premiered on July 16, 1994. On the subject of play-by-play man Al Michaels returning to baseball {{for the first time since}} the infamous 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer said [...] "Here Al is, having done five games since [...] and steps right in. It's hard to comprehend how one <b>guy</b> <b>could</b> so amaze." [...] Meanwhile, Brent Musburger, CBS alumnus Jim Kaat, and Jack Arute became the secondary team for ABC.|$|E
2500|$|The pair {{continue}} their affair in secret {{but it soon}} becomes problematic. Arfwedson told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Jesse really understands Zosia. She is played as an [...] "ice queen" [...] yet she just [...] "melts" [...] in his presence. Jesse tries {{to distance himself from}} Zosia and she attempts to win him creating negative consequences for her. The actress detailed the scenes in which Zosia sneaks into an important neurological operation to be close to him. But Jesse cannot cope with her distraction and she kisses him. But the move causes [...] "everything to blow up in her face". The episodes which aired in July feature Jesse ending his relationship with Zosia for good when she becomes too serious about their future. But when Guy finds out about their affair he punches Jesse and he leaves Holby City. Arfwedson assessed that <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> not accept Zosia and Jesse because the latter [...] "is such a player" [...] and has been sleeping with his daughter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{promoter}} became violently {{angry and}} [...] "sailed into us, barehanded", threatening {{to stop the}} fight. Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, [...] "I might kill that skinny guy." [...] The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as [...] "Jack Dempsey", the future champion downed Copelin six times {{in the first round}} and twice in the second. From there, it was a battle of attrition ("Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek."), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. Dempsey: [...] "In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one <b>guy</b> <b>could</b> move." [...] This trial by fire carried with it a $100.00 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, [...] "...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything." ...|$|E

They do not lose their habits until later.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, {{five of the}} company's {{games were}} ported to the Commodore VIC-20. Developer Neil Harris recalled: [...] "Our sales <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> not {{figure out what they}} were gonna do with them. 'What are these games? It's all words on the screen! There's no graphics! What kind of a video game doesn't have video?' laughs And they became the best-selling {{cartridges}} for the VIC-20, period." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} the title track {{surprised}} Donaldson: [...] "We made the date and we were three minutes short. I said we don't have no more material. And the guy said just play anything for three minutes so we can fill out the time. So I just made the riff and naturally the <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> follow it. That's the only damn thing that sold on the record." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Hamburg, the Sircello's first child, Maria Anne Sircello was born, and {{the family}} {{returned}} to New York with another daughter as well, an adopted daughter, Deborah Ruth Sircello. In New York, the family grew as the Sircellos also became foster parents to Deborah's brothers, Billie, Alexander, and Constantine (Stan). In 1963, another daughter, Pier Andrea, was born in New York City {{just prior to the}} family's move to Portland, so that <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> join the Reed faculty. In Portland, in 1965, another daughter, Anne-Marie Sircello was born, not long after the death of Maria Anne, who had been born with multiple serious disabilities. In 1966, the entire family of eight moved to Irvine, and finally, in 1967, the final child of the Sircello family, Christopher Chapin Sircello, was born. Guy was an attentive and involved father, and enjoyed family camping outings to Yosemite, a three-month family camping trip to Europe, and visits to museums, concerts, and the ballet. He was a major influence, along with Sharon, in three of his children becoming professional dancers, two others becoming professional visual artists, and another an accomplished amateur pianist.|$|E
2500|$|When Barrington had {{his second}} heart attack Ann quickly called the team {{physiotherapist}} Bernard Thomas {{from the next}} room and ran downstairs for help while he tried to resuscitate Ken. She found Alan Smith in the crowded lobby and they called for a doctor and an ambulance, {{but by the time}} they arrived Barrington was already dead. They tried to keep the death a secret until his son <b>Guy</b> <b>could</b> be told at his boarding school, but his body had to be sent to the mortuary via the lobby and the news soon leaked. The England captain Ian Botham was told and he and Smith informed each member of the team in the morning. They had a minute's silence at the team meeting before returning to the Kensington Oval, where Barrington had made his maiden Test century 21 years before. The news was announced at the ground and there was another one minute's silence at the beginning of play. The England team were distraught and Robin Jackman said he couldn't bowl properly as he had tears in his eyes. Unsurprisingly they lost the Test by 298 runs, though Graham Gooch made a fighting 116 in their second innings. He later said ...|$|E
