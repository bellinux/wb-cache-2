The decision was published in the Government Gazette, making the prescribed medicinal use of cannabis legal. With the announcement, Tsipras commented ″our country is turning a page on its history since Greece is now included in the countries where the prescription of medical cannabis is legal for patients who are in need of it″.|$|E
50|$|The presidential decree, {{that was}} issued to clearly demarcate the {{protected}} zones and protection measures, overlooked {{the creation of}} a local Reserve Management Agency. MOm, aided by the European Commission, initiated the reserve's support and monitor program. This action is implemented with the local operators of the high-speed craft Alonnisos and the first few years in close cooperation with the Fishing Cooperative of Alonnisos. Following the environmental study that lasted several years issued by a <b>Joint</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Decision</b> which set out the composition {{of the board of the}} management agency of the marine park, the overall responsibility for managing the reserve passed to the new management agency. MOm participates as a full member of the board, the Operational Management Council, however, without a clearly defined plan of operation, with lack of funding and some unfortunate choice of a president of the board for the next three years remained ineffective. In 2007, some funding by the Third EU Community Support Framework initiated the first steps of operation. The current situation is critical, since the choices to be made and management actions to be implemented will determine both the credibility of the new management agency and the protection of the coastal region.|$|E
40|$|Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos" (AIA) is {{considered}} a pioneer international Public-Private Partnership, being the first major greenfield airport constructed with {{the participation of the}} private sector with the BOOT method (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer). AIA's 1 st day of operation was in March 2001 and the aircraft traffic on 2006 reached 191. 000 movements & 15. 1 million passengers. According to the European Directive 49 / 2002 and the <b>Joint</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Decision</b> 13586 / 724 - 28 / 3 / 06, Athens International Airport (AIA) is included in the category of "large airports" and it consequently comes under the authority of the above mentioned legislation on the evaluation and management of environmental noise. A complete Study on Aircraft Noise [1], according to the European Directive 49 / 2002 [2] and <b>Joint</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Decision</b> 13586 / 724 - 28 / 3 / 06 was undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} Ministry of Environment, Energy & Climate Change, the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority, and AIA S. A. In this article the following results are presented: a) The 2006 Strategic Noise Map (SNM) of both indicators Lden and Lnight based on the ECAC. CEAC Doc 29 methodology "Report on Standard Method of Computing Noise Contours around Civil Airports", 1997 [3], b) A statistical analysis of predicted vs measured noise levels based on the existing Noise Monitoring System, c) Effects from the removal of marginally accepted chapter 3 aircraft, d) A complete evaluation of results regarding calculation of area/land uses and number of individuals living in residences inside blocks exposed in various levels of noise, and e) A full evaluation of Noise Action Plans (NAP) regrouping existing and foreseen actions, especially regarding among others, noise abatement procedures, a comprehensive noise insulation legal framework...|$|E

30|$|The {{importance}} of agricultural crop insurance as a risk mitigation strategy {{to climate change}} in Burkina Faso was first highlighted in the country’s National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA). However, it was the <b>Joint</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Decision</b> N 0 2012 MAH/MRA/MEDD/MEF/MICA/MASSN/MATD of 2012 that formally {{set the stage for}} its operationalization and implementation in the country. However, prior to the decision, the first pilot initiative in the country (i.e., Satellite-based weather index insurance) took off in early 2011 by PlaNet Guarantee which mainly targeted maize and cotton farmers (Planet Guarantee 2014). Similar to many existing crop insurance pilot schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), yield losses are not directly measured in the fields of insured farmers. Rather, they are indirectly assessed through the value of an index (decadal relative evapotranspiration), which is measured through remote sensing approaches (i.e., EARS method) [Muller 2012].|$|E
40|$|The Egnatia Motorway {{is the one}} of {{the major}} road {{construction}} projects being carried out in Greece and, {{one of the largest in}} Europe. It constitutes one of the 14 TENT (Transportation European Network) priority projects and is co-funded by the European Union. It is a 670 km modern motorway which is the communication link spanning Northern Greece from its western to its eastern border. The Egnatia Motorway is one of the first large-scale public works to apply a system of environmental management, that is, a method of organising and implementing environmental protection measures in the design, construction, operation and maintenance stages of the project. Egnatia Odos S. A. is the company ensuring the construction, maintenance and operation of the Egnatia motorway, which in close co-operation with the University of Thessaly - Faculty of Civil Engineering (Transportation sector) has executed since 2007 an extended specialised program throughout the axis of Egnatia Motorway, aiming at the detection of road traffic noise caused by the road circulation. The results of the program were evaluated and used in order to take the necessary measures so as to limit the disturbance of the population caused by noise. The whole program is performed with respect to the European Guideline 2002 / 49 /?U "concerning the evaluation and management of environmental noise" of the Council dated 25. 6. 2002 and the relevant Greek <b>Joint</b> <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Decision</b> 13586 / 724 (GG 384 28. 3. 2006) concerning the "definition of measures, terms and methods of evaluating and managing noise in the environment"...|$|E
