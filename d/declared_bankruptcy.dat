When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing.

5|$|In 1896, Savage sued his {{publisher}} for $12,000 in unpaid royalties. The publisher, Frank Tennyson Neely, who {{had filed}} for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client, argued {{that he did not}} owe Savage anything, instead, Savage owed him. Neely's scattered and incomplete accounting books prevented an easy conclusion to the trial. Three years later, Neely once again <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> In 1899, Abraham Lewis of Brooklyn sued Savage for $10,000 in damages, for stealing away the affections of his wife. Savage's own wife and a friend defended him in court, saying Lewis, an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage's command, was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but illegal act of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1893 had a {{severely}} {{negative effect on}} the Hoosier economy when many factories closed and several railroads <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The Pullman Strike of 1894 hurt the Chicago area and coal miners in southern Indiana participated in a national strike. Hard times were not limited to industry; farmers also felt a financial pinch from falling prices. The economy began to recover when World War I broke out in Europe, creating a higher demand for American goods. Despite economic setbacks, advances in industrial technology continued throughout the last years of the 19th and into the 20th century. On July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes successfully road tested his first automobile, and opened the Haynes-Apperson auto company in 1896. In 1895, William Johnson invented a process for casting aluminum.|$|E
5|$|Wien Air Alaska, {{which had}} its {{headquarters}} in Fairbanks, was the state's largest private employer until it <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 1983. The resulting shutdown cost hundreds of jobs in Fairbanks. This was a foretaste of more problems to come. In 1986, Saudi Arabia boosted oil production and oil prices plummeted. Alaska banks failed, construction came to a halt, and bankruptcies and foreclosures were common. A common practice in Fairbanks was for workers to drop their house keys off at local banks before catching a flight out of Alaska, the better to speed the foreclosure process. Although an expansion of Fort Wainwright helped the construction industry during this time, Fairbanks lost about 3,000 jobs between 1986 and 1989. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division was stationed at Fort Wainwright in late 1987, but it {{was reduced to a}} single brigade and renamed in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Between 1936 and 2001, {{the award}} was given {{at an annual}} gala {{ceremony}} at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. The Downtown Athletic Club's facilities were damaged during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Due to financial difficulties stemming from the damage, the DAC <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 2002, turning over its building to creditors. Following the club's bankruptcy {{and the loss of}} the original Downtown Athletic Club building, the Yale Club of New York City assumed presenting honors in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony was moved to the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square for the 2002, 2003, and 2004 presentations, but since 2005, the event has been held at the venue now known as PlayStation Theater, also in Times Square. The move to the PlayStation Theater allowed the Downtown Athletic Club (and ultimately, the award's successor, The Heisman Trust) to resume full control of the eventâ€”the most prominent example of which was the return of the official portraits of past winnersâ€”despite the loss of the original presentation hall.|$|E

5|$|It {{had taken}} {{a decade and a}} half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 millionâ€”a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally historyâ€”almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an inability to pay off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
5|$|Trappers and explorers {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Idaho {{in the early}} 19thcentury. They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the Oregon and California trails. The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries. Fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin {{in the northern part}} of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver. For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range. Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, lead, and zinc. The Black Pine Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954. The Black Pine Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The location of the mine has since been reclaimed.|$|E

On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools {{with the assistance of the}} Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2015, the league's Board {{unanimously}} {{approved of}} several charges for {{players and coaches}} from the Rainmen. The organization {{as a whole was}} fined $20,000 per league rules, head coach Josep ClarÃ³s was fined $10,000 and assistant coach Pedro Monteiro was fined $5,000. Both coaches received lifetime bans from the NBL Canada as well. A $5,000 fine was imposed on every player on the team's roster, excluding Douglas Appiah, Jr. who was injured {{at the time of the}} brawl. They were also suspended indefinitely during the investigation. Later on, the league allowed the Rainmen's players to apply for reinstatement into the league, although the coaches remained banned for life. Halifax's fines totaled $90,000. The Rainmen were not notified of their fines and suspensions through e-mail or a phone call. Instead they learned of it through Twitter. ClarÃ³s officially received his termination letter on May 5, after his contract had already been renewed for one more month. In an effort to give the players and coaches their final paychecks, he contacted the Canadian labour board. After one month, ClarÃ³s won the decision, but Levingston <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> on July 6, the following day. According to bankruptcy documents, the Rainmen were about $700,000 in debt.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Schindler {{had spent}} his entire fortune on bribes and black-market {{purchases}} of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich, but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In fact, he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria, a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including a cement factory. He <b>declared</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of the}} Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Other awards include the German Order of Merit (1966).|$|E
