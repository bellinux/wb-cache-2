25|$|The Sweden Finns {{are either}} native to Sweden or have emigrated from Finland to Sweden. An {{estimated}} 450,000 first- or second-generation immigrants from Finland live in Sweden, of which approximately half speak Finnish. The majority moved from Finland to Sweden following the Second World War, {{taking advantage of}} the rapidly expanding Swedish economy. This emigration peaked in 1970 and has been declining since. There are also native Finnish-speaking minorities in Sweden, e.g. the Tornedalingar (Meänmaa Finns) and the Finns of <b>Dalecarlia.</b> The Finnish language has official status as one of five minority languages in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|The {{topography}} of the District of Columbia {{is very similar}} to the physical geography of much of Maryland. The District has three major natural flowing bodies of water: the Potomac River and two tributaries, the Anacostia River and Rock Creek. The confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia forms the historic peninsula known as Arsenal Point. The District also includes the Washington Channel, which flows into the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers. There are also three man-made reservoirs: <b>Dalecarlia</b> Reservoir, which crosses over the northwest border of the District from Maryland, McMillan Reservoir near Howard University, and Georgetown Reservoir upstream of Georgetown. A fourth, minor reservoir is at Fort Reno in Tenleytown.|$|E
25|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{was born}} in Stockholm as the oldest son of Duke Charles of the Vasa dynasty and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. At the time, the King of Sweden was Gustavus Adolphus' cousin Sigismund. The staunch Protestant Duke Charles forced the Catholic Sigismund {{to let go of}} the throne of Sweden in 1599, a part of the {{preliminary}} religious strife before the Thirty Years' War, and reigned as regent before taking the throne as Charles IX of Sweden in 1604. Crown Prince Gustav Adolph had Gagnef-Floda in <b>Dalecarlia</b> as a duchy from 1610. Upon his father's death in October 1611, a sixteen-year-old Gustavus inherited the throne (declared of age and able to reign himself at seventeen as of 16 December), as well as an ongoing succession of occasionally belligerent dynastic disputes with his Polish cousin. Sigismund III wanted to regain the throne of Sweden and tried to force Gustavus Adolphus to renounce the title.|$|E

Water) is an {{independent}} authority of the D.C. government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in Washington. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's <b>Dalecarlia,</b> Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water {{for a total of}} 1.1 million people in the District and Virginia, including [...] Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.

2500|$|Before either {{connection}} was made, however, another branch was {{built around the}} west side of Washington. During the 1880s the B had organised a group of bankrupt railroads in Virginia into the Virginia Midland Railroad. The VM track ran from Alexandria to Danville, Virginia. The line projected west across the Potomac River was intended to cross the Potomac just north of the D.C. line, to continue southwest to a connection with the B Virginia Midland (VM) in Fairfax (now Fairfax Station, to distinguish it from what was Fairfax Court House and is now the City of Fairfax, Virginia), and if possible to a connection with the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in Quantico. The branch was started in 1892 and reached Chevy Chase, Maryland, the same year. Financial problems in both the VM and B forced a halt to construction and led to the B's loss of control of the VM. [...] Following bankruptcy, and control by the Pennsylvania Railroad, by the time the line was completed in 1910 there was no longer any point to the river crossing. Thus, the renamed Georgetown Branch came to serve a wide range of customers in Maryland and in Georgetown, such as the Potomac Electric Power Company, the Washington Milling Company, and the U.S. government. The line cut directly across various creeks, and includes what was said to be the longest wood trestle on the railroad over Rock Creek; and a short tunnel, <b>Dalecarlia</b> Tunnel, under the Washington Aqueduct. The line was almost completely abandoned in 1986 by CSX and is presently used in part as the right-of-way for the Capital Crescent Trail.|$|E

The first section of the trail to open, in April 1995, was built by PEPCO in exchange for easement considerations elsewhere and ran from Bethesda Avenue to Little Falls Parkway. Montgomery County, with financial assistance from Maryland {{and the federal government}} and planning from the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, built the section from Little Falls Parkway to the District Line. Arlington County, oddly, built a section of the trail near <b>Dalecarlia</b> Reservoir because they were doing unrelated work on pipelines in the area. [...] Finally, the National Park Service built the section from <b>Dalecarlia</b> Reservoir to Georgetown, with all of the work except for the Arizona Avenue Trestle completed in 1994. In 1995, the concrete deck of the trestle was poured, replacing the wooden deck built 5 years earlier. In 1996 a trail bridge was opened over busy River Road and the <b>Dalecarlia</b> Bridge was completed.

However, muddy water from Little Falls Branch continued to flow into the reservoir, and a bypass pipe was built to channel the aqueduct water to another city reservoir, the Georgetown Reservoir. In 1895 construction was completed to fully divert the stream from the <b>Dalecarlia</b> Reservoir.|$|E
