40|$|The word "vecindad" in Spanish means neighborhood, but {{the word}} {{is also used to}} {{describe}} a <b>dwelling</b> <b>form.</b> The vecindad is usually known as a row of one-room dwellings surrounding an open space or patio. This kind of <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> exists in most Latin American countries as well as in Spain, however the word "vecindad" is used exclusively in Mexico. This <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> existed in Spain under the name of "corrales" and it was brought to Mexico in the XVI century with the Conquest of 1521. Initially, vecindades were built as multi-family tenements to rent to low-income artisans or workers in Mexico. There are two kinds: the multi-storied ones which were built within the Traza, which was the first design of Mexico City by the Spaniards; and the one-storied buildings built in the Indian barrios located {{on the periphery of the}} Traza. While each vecindad is different, they share the same elements such as the zahuan (entrance), the patio, the dwellings and the accesorias (commercial spaces). The number and dimensions of these elements vary depending on the characteristics of each vecindad. From the XVI century until the early XX century, vecindades comprised the majority of the housing stock in Mexico City. In the 1940 's, due to the ideas of Functionalism, vecindades ceased to be built and were relegated as an old and traditional <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> in the center of the city. This thesis presents the origin, evolution and present condition of vecindades within the Traza of Mexico City. Their adaptability to fulfill social, cultural and political circumstances throughout the history of Mexico City reveals their importance as the city's main collective urban <b>dwelling</b> <b>form...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{relation}} of " theory to empirical research in the broad area indicated by the title is examined. The relevance, and, in cases, the adequacy, is discussed of existing theory for 'making sense ' of specific empirical data on one item, or segment, of the built environment, namely, the specialised <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> of the bungalow, which, in both name and single-storey form, as vacation house or suburban dwelling, has been introduced to many market economies around the world. After a brief consideration of the historical and cross-cultural approaches {{to the study of}} the built environment and its neglect in the new urban studies, a series of questions generated by the data and contextualised within specific theoretical spheres are addressed. These include: {{the relation}} of building form to economy, society, and culture; culture and the political economy of building form; the social production of specialised dwelling forms; the relationship between per capita income, tenure, and <b>dwelling</b> <b>form,</b> and between dwelling and settlement forms; urban and building form and the world system; counterurbanisation and the world economy; and the political economy of global urbanisation. It is concluded that, for the adequate conceptualisation of the built environment, the use of theory must be eclectic and prepared to draw on different disciplines. ...|$|E

The main arena for competitive display and distinction is on the front facades of the dwellings where variations in colour and form become increasingly evident as settlements consolidate.

40|$|Modern {{biological}} studies often {{employ a}} synthesis of multiple fields to accomplish a unified research goal. For instance, evolution of development (evo-devo) answers questions concerning the emergence of unique organismal phenotypes resulting from changes in evolutionary and developmental forces. I am interested in studying these forces on a microevolutionary scale. To accomplish this, I use the teleost fish Astyanax mexicanus. This species, indigenous to Mexico, is comprised of two forms: a surface stream <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> (surface fish) and a cave <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> (cavefish). Cavefish, which are the evolutionary descendent of surface fish, have evolved a number of constructive and regressive features {{as a result of}} being exposed to the subterranean environment, including loss of functional eyes and melanin pigment. Thus, Astyanax is ideal for comparative studies on a microevolutionary scale. I am interested in studying changes in eye development between surface fish and cavefish, and how this may relate to the evolution of the two forms. I initially utilized a comparative approach, using candidate gene, cell proliferation, and cell death studies. I extended these studies to include differential gene expression analyses as a means to better understand differences between surface fish and cavefish development. To further this understanding, I ultimately performed surface fish to cavefish lens transplants and surface fish lens deletions to study the effect of the lens on eye development. Finally, I integrate these data into a theory concerning eye development in Astyanax and put these developmental phenomena in the context of evolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} of traditional Chinese urban dwellings mainly {{focuses on the}} dwelling forms in large cities, like Beijing and Guangzhou. The urban form and architectural typology in prefectural level cities (Zhou 州 and Fu 府cities in history) are generally overlooked. The city of Chaozhou (潮州), a typical southern Chinese prefectural city, has large areas of well-preserved urban fabric constituted of courtyard houses with unique local characteristics. However, a thorough study of its urban forms and architecture {{is yet to be}} explored. This thesis aims to explore the relation between <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> and urban fabric in Chaozhou’s historical district, and to look into the elements of urban fabric in Chaozhou, including the shaping of urban structure, sub-dimension of urban blocks, the location of houses within urban blocks, and the way that houses are arranged. The urban fabric of Chaozhou is examined at four levels. First, the transformation of urban structure and public space is represented based on the analysis of primary sources. Second, a typological approach is adopted in this thesis to analyze the urban fabric and traditional dwelling forms based on the field study in “Yi xing jia (义兴甲) ” Historical Conservation Area of Chaozhou. The dwelling units are categorized into 14 types, according to the layout and scale of the courtyard houses. The survey and illustration of courtyard dwellings has been done with the help of open-ended interviews. Third, the relation between <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> and plot pattern is carefully examined, and a set of modules that control and influence the urban fabric and dwelling forms are analyzed through maping. Finally, the transformation of dwelling forms in Chaozhou from imperial China to the Republic era is reviewed, through the comparison between courtyard houses of Chaozhou and Beijing, as well as urban dwelling and rural dwelling. The findings of this study prove firstly that the shaping of Chaozhou city’s form is a process of natural growth and a result of planning, which leads to the irregular urban blocks with an organic pattern, and also the regular urban blocks with a grid pattern. Secondly, a clear module of urban fabric in Chaozhou controls the depth of urban blocks and the dimension of plots, and ultimately affects the choice of dwelling forms within the urban blocks. This research argues that three elements of urban forms (urban block, plot pattern and <b>dwelling</b> <b>form)</b> have interrelationship with each other. Fundamentally, all the plot patterns and dwelling forms are constrained by the block sizes. Streets changed very little, and as a result, the traditional residential fabric has remained through the long-history of socio-economic upheavals in Chaozhou. Finally, Chaozhou has developed a variety of residential building types, and this variety has been shaped over a long historical process. Several original dwelling types were largely determined by the socio-economic condition of the householder and the original land divisions. During the early modern time, with the introduction of modern building materials and technology, as well as the influence of overseas cultures, Chaozhou’s dwelling types transformed in several ways, adopting more free layout and formspublished_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} for good thermal design of houses in {{hot and humid}} climates are well known. Heating is largely un-necessary and evaporative cooling methods often ineffective, but strategies such as ensuring good ventilation, adequate shading to walls and windows, and providing ventilated roof spaces with insulated ceilings are commonly employed as passive design elements. Passive design considerations are important when designing housing for remote Indigenous communities in tropical regions, {{but there are other}} design priorities that must be accommodated. These priorities include cultural practices and preferences regarding <b>dwelling</b> <b>form,</b> privacy and security, climate suitability, durability, and the logistics of building in remote areas.

40|$|Albinism, {{the loss}} of melanin pigmentation, has evolved in a diverse variety of cave animals but the {{responsible}} evolutionary mechanisms are unknown. In Astyanax mexicanus, which has a pigmented surface <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> (surface fish) and several albino cave-dwelling forms (cavefish), albinism is caused by loss of function mutations in the oca 2 gene, which operates during {{the first step of}} the melanin synthesis pathway. In addition to albinism, cavefish have evolved differences in behavior, including feeding and sleep, which are {{under the control of the}} catecholamine system. The catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways diverge after beginning with the same substrate, L-tyrosine. Here we describe a novel relationship between the catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways in Astyanax. Our results show significant increases in L-tyrosine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in pre-feeding larvae and adult brains of Pachón cavefish relative to surface fish. In addition, norepinephrine is elevated in cavefish adult kidneys, which contain the teleost homologs of catecholamine synthesizing adrenal cells. We further show that the oca 2 gene is expressed during surface fish development but is downregulated in cavefish embryos. A key finding is that knockdown of oca 2 expression in surface fish embryos delays the development of pigmented melanophores and simultaneously increases L-tyrosine and dopamine. We conclude that a potential evolutionary benefit of albinism in Astyanax cavefish may be to provide surplus L-tyrosine as a precursor for the elevated catecholamine synthesi...|$|E
40|$|With {{the process}} of urbanization, {{a large number of}} {{residential}} quarters, which is the main <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> in the urban area of Beijing, have been developed in last three decades to accommodate the rising population. In the context of intensification of urban heat island (UHI), the potential degradation of the thermal environment of residential quarters can give rise to a variety of problems affecting inhabitants' health. This paper reports the results of a numerical study of the thermal conditions of a residential quarter on a typical summertime day under four greening modification scenarios, characterized by different leaf area density (LAD) profiles. The modelling results demonstrated that vegetation could evidently reduce near-surface air temperature, with the combination of grass and mature trees achieving as much as 1. 5 degrees C of air temperature decrease compared with the non-green scenario. Vegetation can also lead to smaller air temperature fluctuations, which contribute to a more stable microclimate. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was then calculated to represent the variation of thermal environment of the study area. While grass is helpful in improving outdoor thermal comfort, trees are more effective in reducing the duration and expansion of suffering from severe heat stress. The results of this study showed that proper maintenance of vegetation, especially trees, is significant to improving the outdoor thermal environment in the summer season. In consideration of the deficiency of the current code in the management of greenspace in residential areas, we hope the results reported here will help promote the improvement of the code and related regulations for greenspace management...|$|E

The reality is we buy, build and expand to have big houses as close as {{practical}} to the city. While {{a lot of research}} looks at the urban, suburban and rural debate, the size of our houses and apartments across Australian have been increasing. Originality/value: Often in literature on housing, size is a factor in the variables but it is rarely the focus. This research focuses on the factors that determine dwelling size and the influences behind those choices. Findings: A home does not just provide shelter for our family; it is storage for our possessions, it expresses our desired social status and offers a sense of financial security. These aspects of life are changing and our houses are increasing to accommodate them. Design/methodology/approach: An examination of the literature on role of the home to identify how changes to that role is impacting the size dimension.

40|$|Casalini and {{the design}} of the medieval city This paper will discuss a smaller scale {{architectural}} element, the “casalino”, which was quite present in notarial documentation and in the statutes of medieval cities. For a time indicated as “dwelling” or buildable urban space, this type appears in numerous local variations both in relation to its physical and legal status as well as with different formulas and denominations, recorded over a period ranging from the Middle Ages until the early modern period. It is therefore indicated as a built element in less documented contexts and takes on secondary meanings, distant from the original concept linked to an architectural or urban project. Casalini, often found in acts or regulations issued by municipal or ecclesiastical authorities, seem to be inalienable assets connected to important acts of urban foundation or the planned and designed expansion of an existing settlement. Their mere presence in a city or a street constitutes evidence of some urbanizing or populating act. Their particular location, but also the conditions of the use of their perimeter walls, leads {{to the study of the}} medieval <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> which was originally legally separated from its building lot, and potentially temporary and removable. The meaning of casalino is therefore close to that of units and cadastral particle.

They are consequently enriched with additional values that bear witness to their role in relation to the periods of formation of streets and towns...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to indoor allergens {{is crucial}} for IgE {{sensitization}} and development of allergic symptoms. Residential settings influence the allergen amount in house dust and hence allergic sensitization. Within this study, we investigated allergen exposure and molecule-based IgE levels in a geographically confined region and evaluated the impact of housing, pets and cleaning. 501 adolescents from Salzburg, Austria participated in this cross-sectional study. House dust samples were examined regarding major mite, cat, dog, and mold allergens using a multiplex assay. Serum samples of participants were analyzed for specific IgE to Der p 1, Der p 2, Fel d 1, Can f 1 and Alt a 1 using the multiplex array ImmunoCAP ISAC. Information on allergies, living areas, <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> (house, flat, farm), pets, and household cleanliness were obtained by a questionnaire. In investigated house dust samples, the concentration of cat allergen was highest while the prevalence of mold allergens was very low. Participants showed IgE sensitization to Der p 1 (13. 2 %), Der p 2 (18. 2 %), Fel d 1 (14. 4 %), Can f 1 (2. 4 %) and Alt a 1 (2. 0 %). In alpine regions, lower mite allergen concentrations were detected which correlated with reduced IgE levels. A trend for increased sensitization prevalence from rural to alpine to urban regions was noted. Living on farms resulted in lower sensitization prevalence to mite and cat allergens, even though exposure to mites was significantly elevated. The presence of cats {{was associated with a}} lower sensitization rate and IgE levels to cat and mite allergens, and less frequent allergic diseases. Cleaning did not impact allergen concentrations, while IgE reactivity to mites and allergic diseases were more pronounced when living in cleaner homes. Allergen exposure to indoor allergens was influenced by setting of homes. Living in a farm environment and having a cat at home showed a protective effect for IgE sensitization and allergies. This cross-sectional study in combination with hereditary and lifestyle factors enables development of risk schemes for a more efficient management and potential prevention of allergic diseases...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The research, undertaken {{within the context of}} recent studies on the mutual relation between society and its built environment, concerns a particular item in that environment - the specialised <b>dwelling</b> <b>form</b> of the bungalow - and the various historical forces which have produced it. It also explores the meaning of that form for, and its influences on, the society where it exists. The study has two dimensions: 'a cultural history of the bungalow' and a discussion of various themes which the investigation of that history suggests. The bungalow is probably the only house-type which, both in name (from 'bangla', meaning of, or belonging to Bengal) and form exists in almost every continent. In investigating its origins in India, and later development in Britain, North America, Australia, Africa and Europe, the study explores the historical forces which, in producing it, have also shaped the modern world: colonialism, industrialisation, urbanisation and suburbanisation, and the emergence of a global economy and culture. In different historical contexts, the bungalow has been variously peasant's hut, colonial dwelling, specialised vacation house, country retreat, tropical dwelling, and suburban home. In tracing these developments, the chapters discuss the economic. political, cultural, social and other influences on dwelling and urban form; the symbolic function of architecture and environments; the relationship between social form-and built form, ideology and environment, and dwelling type and property ownership. The role of economic and social power in shaping environments is discussed in relation to 'town and country planning' in Britain. Chapters on India and Africa explore, in the context of debates on 'Westernisation' the transfer of values and standards in housing and planning, {{as part of a larger}} transformation of material culture. In investigating the social production and meaning of the bungalow, the study attempts a comparative, inter-disciplinary approach to the-historical study of the built. environment, drawing on social and cultural explanations of built form, the political economy of urbanisation and studies of the world system...|$|E
