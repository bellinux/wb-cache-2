5|$|On Lombok, Wallace observes how {{guns are}} made, {{witnessing}} the boring of gun barrels {{by two men}} rotating a pole which is weighted down by a basket of stones. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> Sasak people of the island, and the custom of running amok.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> conodont genus Culumbodina. In 1988, <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> conodont order Proconodontida and the conodont family Gnathodontidae.|$|R

50|$|In 1981, <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> conodont family Paracordylodontidae. In 1974, <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> multielement conodont genus Appalachignathus {{from the}} Middle Ordovician of North America.|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> {{range of}} species {{in each group}} in some detail, {{concluding}} that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> atrocious conditions he witnessed in China. Shanghai is depicted as a squalid, noisy, and polluted den of crime, poverty, and disease, and yet still comparatively wealthy compared {{to the rest of}} the country. The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly unsafe for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E
5000|$|Together with Hermann Schlegel <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Madagascan {{fruit bat}} (Eidolon dupreanum) in 1866.

5|$|Gyula Kristó {{and many}} other historians refute Porphyrogenitus's report of the {{omission}} of Álmos in favor of his son, saying that the turul legend connected to Álmos's birth proves his role as forefather of his dynasty. These historians say that the emperor's account {{is based on a}} report by one of Árpád's descendants named Termacsu, who emphasized by this report of Árpád's election that only those descending from Árpád were suitable to lead the Hungarians; other children of Álmos were excluded. András Róna-Tas says that Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved the memory of a coup d'état organized against Levedi kende by Álmos gyula, who had his own son Árpád elected as sacred ruler in his opponent's place. A late 9th-century Central Asian scholar, Abu Abdallah al-Jayhaniwhose works were partially preserved in Ibn Rusta's and other Muslim authors' booksmentions the existence of these two high offices among the Hungarians. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> kende as the Hungarians' sacred ruler and the gyula as their military commander. Historians still debate which of the two offices was held by Álmos.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{interactive}} discussion, Thomson {{was able to}} differentiate the United States from <b>the</b> Philippines. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Philippines {{as a group of}} islands that were rich in natural resources, culture, and traditions. <b>He</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Philippines as [...] "a string of pearls hanging from the golden Equator.” ...|$|R
5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E
5|$|The theory {{describes}} {{five major}} biological processes, namely metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, embryogenesis, and inheritance. Each was defined in some detail, {{in some cases}} sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the mechanisms described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E

5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E
