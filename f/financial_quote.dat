40|$|Abstract- This study {{determines the}} impact of capital {{structure}} on the financial performance of non <b>financial</b> firms <b>quoted</b> at the Nairobi securities exchange (NSE) in Kenya {{for the period of}} 2009 - 2013. The study adopts an explanatory descriptive research design. A sample of 40 non financial firms listed at the NSE is drawn under judgmental sampling method. Secondary data is obtained from NSE hand book. Multiple regression method is used to analyze and test the hypothesis at 5 % and 1 % level of significance with the aid of statistical package for social sciences. The findings show that capital structure variables; current liabilities to total assets ratio, long term liabilities to total assets ratio and total liabilities to total assets ratio have a negative and significant effect on financial performance measured by return on assets for <b>financial</b> firms <b>quoted</b> on the NSE in Kenya. The study concludes that capital structure is an important determinant of firm’s financial performance as shown by prior studies. Index Terms- Capital structure, financial performance, no...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new automated, {{objective}} and intuitive scoring technique {{to measure the}} content of central bank communication about future interest rate decisions based on information from the Internet and news sources. We apply the methodology to statements released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its policy meetings starting in 1999. Using intra-day <b>financial</b> <b>quotes,</b> we find that short-term nominal Treasury yields respond to changes in policy rates around policy announcements, whereas longer-dated Treasuries mainly react to changes in policy communication. Using lower frequency data, we find that changes {{in the content of}} the statements lead policy rate decisions by more than a year in univariate interest rate forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) models. When we estimate Treasury yield responses to the shocks identified in the VAR, we find communication to be a more important determinant of Treasury rates than contemporaneous policy rate decisions. These results are consistent with the view that the FOMC releases information about future policy rate actions in its statements and that market participants incorporate this information when pricing longer-dated Treasuries. Finally, we decompose realized policy rate decisions using a forward-looking Taylor rule model. Based on this decomposition, we find that FOMC statements contain significant information regarding both the predicted rule-based interest rate and the Taylor-rule residual component, and that content of the statements leads the residual by a few quarters. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Financial</b> assets' <b>quoted</b> prices {{normally}} {{change through}} frequent revisions, or jumps. For markets where quotes {{are almost always}} revised by the minimum price tick, this paper proposes a new estimator of Quadratic Variation which is robust to microstructure effects. It compares the number of alternations, where quotes are revised back to their previous price, {{to the number of}} other jumps. Many markets exhibit a lack of autocorrelation in their quotes' alternation pattern. Under quite general 'no leverage' assumptions, whenever this is so the proposed statistic is consistent as the intensity of jumps increases without bound. After an empirical implementation, some useful corollaries of this are given. ...|$|R

The results indicate the existence of economic exposure in many companies. It has also been found that the cross sectional variation in exchange-rate risk of firms is related to the firm s operational and financial characteristics as well as foreign currency hedging proxies...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} statement audit {{is an important}} tool for reducing information asymmetries and maintaining an efficient market environment. However, if the audit is to improve financial performance, there must be credibility and reliability as regards audited financial information. This research work was designed to {{examine the impact of}} audit quality on <b>financial</b> performance of <b>quoted</b> firms in Nigeria. The study is descriptive in nature and the correlational and ex-post facto designs were adopted in carrying out this research. Data were obtained basically from the published annual reports and accounts, and notes to the {{financial statement}}s of the four firms that represent the sample of the study. The data collected were quantified and presented in tables. Multiple regression analysis using the SPSS Version 15. 0 was employed in analyzing the data and testing the stated hypotheses. The results of the findings shows that auditor size and auditor independence have significant impacts on the <b>financial</b> performance of <b>quoted</b> cement firms in Nigeria. However, auditor independence has more influence than auditor size on financial performance. The study recommends that the management of quoted cement firms in Nigeria increase the remuneration of auditors in order to improve their financial performance.

40|$|Providing {{authentication}} {{mechanisms for}} IP-Multicast streams is paramount {{for the development}} of large scale commercial multicast content delivery applications. This need is particularly strong for the delivery of real time content, such as live video/audio news events or <b>financial</b> stock <b>quote</b> distribution. However, this {{turns out to be a}} quite challenging problem for many reasons. First, the authentication of the multicast data must be verifiable by a potentially very large number of untrusted recipients. Second, since multicast communication protocols are almost always best effort, the authentication mechanisms needs to authenticate received content despite the potential loss of some packets. Finally, the authentication mechanism needs to be efficient enough to cope with real time data and should have a small communication overhead. We propose a new multicast authentication scheme designed to authenticate real time multicast packet streams with a potentially unlimited number of recipients. This scheme provides both integrity and nonrepudiation of origin, and in a majority of situations, it performs with less overhead in bytes per packet than previously proposed practical real time stream authentication schemes. ...|$|R
