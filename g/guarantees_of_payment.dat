40|$|Construction {{materials}} suppliers {{have earned}} {{the reputation of}} being the Builders’ Banker. This has come about due to suppliers purveying construction contractors with a form of working capital. Inevitably, with the construction industry being volatile and prone to large numbers of insolvency, the risk associated with being a crediting organisation (e. g. supplier) is high. Suppliers’ utility gain from furnishing credit to contractors is directly related to their financial turnover. Therefore, research into supplier turnover provides valuable insight concerning issues such as their working capital ‘contribution’ to the construction industry. Using data from a UK survey of materials suppliers’ credit control and debt collection practices, stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis identified that suppliers’ turnover was related to: (1) whether they held insurance against bad debt; (2) the total number of credit accounts furnished; (3) the percentage of debting contractors who have credit limits imposed upon them; (4) whether <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> are sought; and (5) turnover trend for the last three years’ trading. The paper identifies that ‘large’ turnover suppliers tend to utilise more ‘formal’ credit control and debt collection practices (i. e. insuring against bad debt and imposing credit limits upon creditworthy contractors). This contrasts to ‘smaller’ turnover contractors, who tend only to seek <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> when a contractor places a substantial order...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, bond {{insurers}} {{have provided}} <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> on municipal bonds, where defaults {{have been very}} limited. But since the late 1990 s they have become increasingly involved as guarantors of elements of various structured financial products: in particular, the credit enhancements provided by these entities have {{played an important role}} in making securities based on sub-prime loans attractive to a wide range of investors. It is this trend change in their activity that has become the focal point in concerns about the health of these entities that have grown during the financial turbulence. The note identifies three policy issues that arise in the context of the current challenges facing these entities and it draws some preliminary findings. First, while concerns regarding the potential financial stability implications of further downgrades and/or failures of some of these companies have ebbed somewhat from their peaks in early 2008, the situation still bears monitoring. Second, current developments raise questions regarding the role of financial guarantors in specific financial market segments. In this context, there appears to be a public interest in the continued availability <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> on <b>payments</b> on municipal bonds. Private solutions seem to be forthcoming. Third, transparency <b>of</b> the financial <b>guarantee</b> insurance sector is limited. In this context, the performance of credit rating agencies in providing guidance for investors regarding the quality <b>of</b> the <b>guarantees</b> provided by financial guarantors appears to have been uneven. ...|$|R
