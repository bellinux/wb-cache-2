5|$|The II SS-Panzer Corps {{continued}} its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. The advance of Leibstandarte was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps, {{which had been}} reinforced by the 9th <b>Guards</b> Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd <b>Guards</b> Rifle Corps. Totenkopf was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd <b>Guards</b> Rifle Corps' 95th <b>Guards</b> Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of Leibstandarte, the 2nd <b>Guards</b> Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of Das Reich.|$|E
5|$|The main Soviet {{armoured}} formation {{involved in}} the battle was the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army, which controlled five corps, two of which were <b>Guards</b> units, by 12 July: the 2nd <b>Guards,</b> 2nd, 5th <b>Guards</b> Mechanized, 18th and 29th Tank Corps. Altogether they fielded 793 tanks and 37 to 57 self-propelled guns {{for a total of}} approximately 840 armoured fighting vehicles. About two-thirds of these tanks were T-34s, while the remainder were T-70 light tanks, with some 31 to 35 Churchill heavy tanks as well. Not all of the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army was present in the Prokhorovka area during the battle, as part of the formation had been sent south to check the advance of the III Panzer Corps. The Soviet armour of the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army – including the newly attached 2nd <b>Guards</b> Tank Corps and 2nd Tank Corps, as well as the 5th <b>Guards</b> Mechanized Corps held in reserve – that faced the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July was about 616 tanks and self-propelled guns. In addition, five artillery regiments, one artillery brigade, and one anti-aircraft artillery division were attached to the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army for the assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{main attack}} of the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army was {{conducted}} against Leibstandarte by its fresh 29th and 18th Tank Corps that had been brought up from the Soviet strategic reserve. These two Soviet tank corps together provided {{the greatest number of}} tanks in the attack, with the 18th Tank Corps fielding 190 tanks and self-propelled guns, and the 29th Tank Corps fielding 212 tanks and self-propelled guns. Infantry support to the 18th and 29th Tank Corps was provided by the 9th <b>Guards</b> Airborne Division. A portion of the 18th Tank Corps was directed against the eastern flank of Totenkopfs 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment Theodor Eicke. On the southeastern wing of the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army, Rotmistrov deployed the 120 tanks of the 2nd <b>Guards</b> Tank Corps. Later on 12 July during the battle, the 26th <b>Guards</b> Tank Brigade of that tank corps with its estimated 40 tanks were sent south to face the III Panzer Corps. The remainder of the 2nd <b>Guards</b> Tank Corps, supported by the remnants of the 2nd Tank Corps, was to attack Das Reich. Their infantry support was provided by the 183rd Rifle Division. The western flank of the 5th <b>Guards</b> Tank Army, which faced Totenkopf, was defended by the 33rd <b>Guards</b> Rifle Corps' 42nd and 95th <b>Guards</b> Rifle Divisions, which were supported by the remnants of the 31st Tank Corps and the heavily depleted 23rd <b>Guards</b> Rifle Corps' 52nd <b>Guards</b> Rifle Division.

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} <b>guards,</b> there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} <b>guards</b> to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the <b>guards</b> come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some <b>guards</b> who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|After a heavy, {{concentrated}} artillery barrage, the White <b>Guards</b> began advancing {{from house}} to house and street to street, as the Red <b>Guards</b> retreated.

5|$|As the <b>guards</b> brigades {{reached their}} objectives, the newly gained ground was {{gradually}} {{turned over to}} reserve HV units. The 163rd Infantry Brigade, defending Dubrovnik during the JNA siege, took over positions captured by the 4th <b>Guards</b> Brigade. The 1st <b>Guards</b> Brigade was relieved and its territorial gains were garrisoned by elements of the 115th Infantry Brigade, the 145th Infantry Brigade, the 148th Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 156th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 102nd Infantry Brigade. The VRS counter-attacked the reserve infantry on 9 July, causing losses and {{the withdrawal of the}} 102nd Infantry Brigade company east of Zavala and the 115th Infantry Brigade from Zavala and Orahov Do. The retreat created a gap in the HV defences, threatening the town of Slano, but the 3rd Battalion of the 4th <b>Guards</b> Brigade closed it. Days later, the 148th Infantry Brigade conceded some of the offensive's gains to another VRS counter-attack near Bobani. On 13 July, a platoon drawn from the 2nd <b>Guards</b> Brigade attempted to capture the Vlaštica Peak, but the attack failed, marking the end of Operation Tiger.|$|E
