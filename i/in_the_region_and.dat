5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>and</b> their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>and</b> the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking {{the beginning of a new}} phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida.

There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h).

5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>and</b> have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
