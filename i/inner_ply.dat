40|$|AbstractCrack {{initiation}} in the <b>inner</b> <b>ply</b> of symmetric [0 / 90]s laminates under {{tension is}} studied applying the coupled stress and energy criterion proposed by Leguillon (Eur. J. Mech. A/Solids 21, 2002) {{in the framework}} of the finite fracture mechanics. This criterion assumes that a crack of a finite extension appears abruptly when the stress criterion is fulfilled and this crack onset is energetically admissible. The stress state is calculated by applying the laminate theory to the undamaged laminate which provides explicit expressions {{to be used in the}} stress criterion. Assuming generalised plane strain, the magnitude involved in the (incremental) energy criterion is evaluated numerically by means of a boundary element code and a dimensional analysis. The two criteria lead to a theoretical model providing explicit expressions of the critical parameters for the crack onset, which depend only on the computational results through a scalar value. This model predicts that the crack grows unstably after the onset in the <b>inner</b> <b>ply</b> and is arrested close to the interface between the plies for a length larger than a certain threshold length independent of the fracture and strength properties. This threshold length depends only on the elastic and geometric properties of the laminate. The model also predicts the existence of a size effect which agrees with the experimental results found in the literature. In addition, the model provides a physical interpretation of this size effect...|$|E
40|$|Deformation {{mechanisms}} and failure of textile laminates are strongly affected by inter-layer configurations – a mutual {{shift of the}} plies. To model it within a traditional framework, one must construct a representative volume element (RVE), which includes all the plies. This is a time consuming and computationally expensive work. As an alternative, the paper suggests boundary conditions (BC) imitating the interaction with the surrounding non-periodic media. This makes possible analysis on a single unit cell of one ply. The proposed BC respect inter-ply configurations, account {{for the number of}} plies, distinguish the ply position, and reproduce the meso stress state with a good accuracy. The BC are constructed through (1) averaging of the known periodic solutions with respect to the ply shifts, (2) separation of the solution to the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>ply</b> cases, (3) energy equilibrium of heterogeneous and effective media.

Prior to mechanical testing, as-manufactured [+ 45 /? 45 / 0] 3,s glass/epoxy specimens were CT scanned to provide 3 -dimensional images of their internal microstructure, including voids. Voids were segmented and extracted, and individual characteristics and volumetric distributions were quantified. The coupons were then fatigue tested in uniaxial loading at R = ? 1 % to 40 % of the nominal tensile failure stress. Some tests were conducted to failure for correlation with the initial void analysis and to establish failure modes. Other tests were stopped at various life fractions and examined using CT to identify key damage mechanisms. These scans revealed transverse matrix cracking in the surface layer, occurring predominantly at free edges. These free-edge cracks then appeared to facilitate edge delamination at the 45 /? 45 ° interface. Propagation from sub-critical, surface ply damage to critical, <b>inner</b> <b>ply</b> damage was identified with either a ? 45 / 0 ° delamination, or a 0 ° fibre tow failure allowing a crack to propagate into the specimen bulk.

40|$|The {{application}} of fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites in aerospace industry has increased drastically {{in the last}} decade. Carbon fibre/Polyether-ether-ketone (C/PEEK) {{is one of the}} high-performance thermoplastic composites and is replacing metallic and thermosetting counterparts in various aircrafts components. Parts made from such composites undergo multiple heat treatment cycles, and each cycle involves processing at temperatures above melt. At these temperatures, thermal stability is a limiting factor, which results in severe thermal degradation of the polymer, especially in oxidative environments. For this project, the thermal degradation of 8 -ply unidirectional C/PEEK composites is investigated. The objectives include finding the reduction in morphological properties of PEEK polymer due to degradation over four different processing temperatures (385, 405, 425, and 445 °C), and times (10, 30, 60, and 90 minutes), in two processing environments (air and nitrogen), exploring the effect of oxygen and temperature on degradation, and evaluating the mechanical performance through three-point bending. Thermal analysis through Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed that the crystallinity reduces from 32 % for an untreated laminate to 28 % for the lowest heat treatment condition (385 °C, 10 minutes). From there, a steady reduction is observed, with 15 % at 425 °C, 60 minutes, and 0 % at 425 °C, 90 minutes and 445 °C, 90 minutes. A contour plot for polymer property reduction based on crystallinity serves as a processing guideline for C/PEEK laminates. DSC analysis through the thickness of air treated laminates showed that surface plies degrade faster than the <b>inner</b> <b>plies.</b> This effect is not observed in a nitrogen environment. This showed the effect of oxygen on the surface. Though <b>inner</b> <b>plies</b> were shielded from oxygen exposure, they still showed a higher degradation than nitrogen treated laminates, showing that diffusion of oxygen through the laminates has taken place. At 425 °C and 445 °C, in air, the through thickness difference is higher compared to 385 °C. So, in oxygen environment, polymer degrades faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures. In nitrogen, at 385 °C, there is almost no degradation, whereas the other three temperatures show an increased degradation. The rate of degradation in different environments and at different temperatures is characterized by computation of activation energies. The air treated laminates showed an activation energy of 126 kJ/mol, whereas, nitrogen treated laminates has 193 kJ/mol. 3 -point bending tests are performed to observe matrix failure. No failure was observed at 10, 30, and 60 minutes at 385 °C, but from 405 °C, cracks starts to appear and cracks initiates at lower stresses with increasing heat treatment conditions.

40|$|Recent roof {{failures}} in South Africa, of multiple ply nail plated trusses, have necessitated a rethink {{about the way}} in which timber trusses are analysed. The authors believe that the relative slip between plies caused by a torsional moment as a result of eccentric loading is a possible reason for some of the failures. The design assumption in South Africa and America is that all the plies share the applied load equally; Eurocode 5 (BS EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004) does not cover the design of multiple ply trusses; and BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 recommends additional load factors to be applied to eccentrically loaded truss components with the outer ply being loaded more than the <b>inner</b> <b>plies,</b> {{as a result of the}} torsion induced by an out-of-plane eccentricity.

40|$|Generating high-energy {{absorbing}} FML concepts {{is challenging}} because aluminium and composite failure mechanisms are acting concurrently during the impact process. Because the impact process involves energy transformation, an analytical energy balance method {{was used to}} assess the contribution of the material constituents in the low-velocity impact energy absorption. The energy approach was combined with a structural approach using the Classical Laminate Theory. This theory covers out-of-plane deformation cases {{that can be used for}} impact studies. Corresponding to this out-of-plane displacement, strain energy was balanced with the energy due to delamination to obtain the absorbed energy. The generic quasi-static energy balance model predicted accurately the low-velocity impact behaviour of FMLs under large mass. The theoretical energy partition among the material constituents was revealed to substantiate firm conclusions on the impact resistance of FMLs. The excellent impact resistance of FMLs is not only due to the increasing strength of glass composites when loaded at higher strain rates. The <b>inner</b> composite <b>plies</b> absorb a minor portion of the impact energy and they direct the impact load in the plate's plane. The outer metal layers limit the extent of delamination and undergo large global displacement before fracture. Due to the generic nature of the developed approach, it was possible to implement minor modifications to predict the low-velocity impact behaviour of an FML-based sandwich structure.

40|$|Engineers {{are still}} looking for ways to improve the {{performance}} of materials used in aircraft. A major step was going from metal parts to laminates in order to save weight significantly. Those laminates existed of fibres with a constant orientation, and became laminates with changing fibre directions. Variable stiffness laminates (VSL) are used for its possibility of exploiting the anisotropic properties of composites. In order to improve the buckling load of a panel, VSL are used. Those laminates steer the loads through the laminate. This is beneficial for maximising the buckling load of a panel. An optimiser is built by the Delft University of Technology to optimise VSL by changing its fibre orientations throughout the entire panel. A manufacturing constraint is added to the optimiser to prevent the fibre paths to have a turn radius of smaller than 0. 333 [m]. Plate designs with fibres paths having a smaller turn radius than this constraint, are assumed to be unmanufacturable. The software optimises fibre paths of VSL against buckling and keeps the stiffness of the entire plate equal or higher than the quasi isotropic design. Since the aircraft of nowadays are stiffener dominated, an extra functionality is added to the optimiser. The optimiser is further developed to be capable of optimising stiffened plates. Stiffeners are taken into account during the optimisation. Extra functionalities such as integrated stiffeners are introduced. These are stiffeners sharing layers with the plate. The extended optimiser is verified by comparing the internal loads from five cases with the values calculated with ABAQUS. After having the optimiser verified, it is used to calculate results for twelve different cases. Those cases range from square unstiffened plates to rectangular plates with two stiffeners. The results show the influence of stiffeners on the optimised panel with changed fibre paths. Those cases are compared to the plate designs with the stiffeners excluded from optimisation. Performance increases of up to 174 % are obtained for balanced symmetric laminates. The results show clearly that when stiffeners are added to a panel, the area in-between the stiffeners can be treated as a simply supported plate. Integrated stiffeners also show a buckling load increase of 113 % with respect to the quasi isotropic case. The fibres of the buckling optimised plates show a relating behaviour. Fibre orientations going towards [45,- 45] are present in buckling critical areas. Near stiffeners and near edges, [0, 0] areas are present in order to introduce the load through the structure. A relation is found between having more [0, 0] orientations in the <b>inner</b> <b>plies</b> of the laminate and significantly more [45,- 45] orientations at the outer plies of the laminate. The outer plies are more critical for buckling, which requires more fibres being close to a [45,- 45] in order to higher the buckling load. The inner areas are less vulnerable for buckling, which creates the opportunity of creating stiffness in the inside of the laminate.

Laminates from 8 -ply to infinitely thick wer, analyzed. Thick laminates were synthesized by stacking (45 / 0 /- 45 / 90) ply groups, rather than grouping like plies. Laminates {{with and without}} delaminations were studied. in laminates without delaminations, the free-edge interlaminar normal stress distribution in the outer ply groups was insensitive to total laminate thickness. The interlaminar normal stress distribution for the interior ply groups was nearly {{the same as for}} an infinitely thick laminate. In contrast, the free-edge interlaminar shear stress distri-bution was nearly the same for <b>inner</b> and outer <b>ply</b> groups and was insensitive to laminate thickness [...] In laminates with delaminations, those delaminations near the top and bottom surfaces of a thick laminate have much larger total strain-energy-release rates and mode I-to-total (G /GT) ratios than delaminations deep in the interior. Therefore, delaminations can be expected to grow more easily near the surfaces of a laminate than in the interior. This is consistent with experimental results reported in the literature. Also, near surface delaminations in thin laminates tend to have larger strain-energy release rates than corresponding near surface delaminations in thick laminates...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{investigate}} stress-induced whitening in glass fibre/epoxy (0, 90) s laminates and to develop a technique to monitor the low strain damage associated with it. The effect of resin cure, laminate geometry, heat treatment and surface finish of glass fibres on the extent and development of damage has also been studied. It has been found that the whitening is caused by the development of micro-cracks in the resin. The micro-cracks developed in the 90 ° ply and occurred predominantly at or near points of contact between fibres where the strain magnification in the resin is highest. The cracks occurred near the fibre/matrix interface and extended into the resin with the crack faces lying at 90 ° to the loading axis. Careful observation under oblique illumination conditions has shown that the whitening effect is preceded by other colour effects so that the laminate is observed to gradually change colour from an original blue through to red or white depending on the level of cure of the matrix resin. The whitening is a result of ordinary diffuse reflections from cracks that are larger than the wavelength of light and occurs when the level of cure of the matrix system is low while the reddening is the result of Rayleigh or Mie scattering from cracks that are smaller than the wavelength of light and occurs when the level of cure of the matrix is high. An off-axis LASER diffraction technique has been developed to monitor the amount of damage in the transverse ply of laminates by measurement of the intensity of light diffracted by the micro-cracks. In addition to confirming the results obtained from photomicroscopy, it revealed that decreasing the <b>inner</b> 90 ° <b>ply</b> thickness in (0, 90) s laminates resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of micro damage in the laminate. Heat treatment of the laminate after testing resulted in the disappearance of whitening and healing of micro-cracks in the resin which continues to cure during heat treatment. Successive heat treatments reduced the size of micro-cracks which developed on reloading. In addition to decreasing the rate of re-development of the original cracks on reloading, the heat treatment reduced the rate of development of "new" cracks formed at higher applied strains...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{are one of}} {{the prospective}} material families being investigated for use in the fuel tanks of future reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). The extreme cryogenic thermo-mechanical loading that these structures experience can lead to damage build-up in the CFRP in the form of microcracking and delamination, which can lead to increased laminate permeability. This work presents a combined experimental and numerical approach for predicting damage and permeability in composite laminates and linerless cryogenic tanks. A novel extended finite element (XFEM) -based methodology for the combined simulation and prediction of thermal fatigue delamination for identification of delaminated crack opening displacement (DCOD) and, hence, composite laminate permeability is presented first. The methodology is validated through simulation of standardised static and fatigue delamination test methods, using computationally efficient modelling techniques. Delamination growth in a quasi-isotropic laminate under cryogenic fatigue loading is used {{to examine the effects of}} initial interlaminar defects on subsequent crack growth, as well as the relationship between delamination length and material permeability based on DCOD values predicted by the new methodology. An experimental investigation into damage formation in CF /PEEK laminates before, during and after cryogenic cycling, using optical microscopy and three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography (CT), is conducted. Thicker laminates were found to exhibit significantly greater microcrack density and delamination when compared to thinner laminates, with lay-up and material type also being important contributing factors. Microcracking induced by thermal residual stresses was also observed in thicker laminates following processing. 3 -D rendering software was used to establish the presence of through thickness crack networks within the laminates, as well as the extent of cracking through the specimen width. Crack opening in <b>inner</b> and off-axis <b>ply</b> groups was found to be significantly less than in outer plies, indicating the importance of these plies for limiting laminate permeability. The presence of voids was found to influence crack nucleation and growth paths within the laminates, with full void volume characterisation presented. A novel computational methodology for predicting three-dimensional microcracking and permeability in composite laminates is presented based on experimental observations and established numerical methods. The methodology simulates (i) microcrack initiation and propagation using XFEM, and (ii) delamination, using a mixed-mode cohesive zone model. Random microcrack initiation is modelled using a random (Weibull) distribution of fracture strengths. The Weibull distribution is adjusted to account for specimen volume, allowing mesh independent crack density predictions. An alternative method is also investigated, based on an elemental representation of defects using measured void geometry. The predicted microcracking and damage distributions are shown to correlate closely with 3 -D X-ray CT scans of cryogenically cycled specimens. Crack opening displacements are consistent with laminate test measurements. Permeabilities, based on the dimensions of the leak paths, were found to be within the measured range for various CF/PEEK materials. Finally, a combined experimental and numerical approach to the design and analysis of tape-laid composite cryogenic tanks is presented. A detailed material and defect characterisation of automated tape-laid CF/PEEK was undertaken using optical micrography and 3 -D X-ray CT, as well as cryogenic testing to investigate damage formation. Resulting material data is used as input to a novel XFEM-cohesive zone methodology which is used to predict intra- and inter-ply damage in an internally pressurised cryogenic tank. An optimised tank lay-up is presented and tested using the numerical method to ensure resistance to microcrack formation and fuel leakage through the tanks walls under operating loads...|$|R
40|$|Good skid {{resistance}} of a pavement surface {{is essential for}} road safety. Loss of {{skid resistance}} can lead to property damage and loss of lives. Ever increasing need of driver safety poses challenges to the highway authorities to evaluate pavement conditions even more precisely under different conditions. Environmental variables like temperature, water, snow etc. can {{have a significant effect}} on the skid resistance apart from the vehicle and pavement related factors. The temperature increase in the tire-pavement contact region results in a complex relationship between the temperature and the friction and constitutes one of the main sources of uncertainty in interpreting the data of continuous field measurements. Likewise, very low friction coefficients can be observed between the tire and pavement surface under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the phenomena have not been adequately quantified yet within the skid resistance evaluation engineering community. The road agencies use correlation factors to estimate frictional characteristics of the road. These correlation factors are based on the experience and field test measurements which have a very limited scope in terms of reliability and transferability. It is the aim of this research is to study the effect of temperature and water on the frictional performance of the asphalt surface, when a pneumatic tire is traversing at given operating conditions. The tire operating temperature is a very important concern to the tire manufacturers, highway agencies and users due to its major influence on the traction performance of a tire. Tire rubber hysteresis is considered to play a major role in countering skidding of a vehicle travelling at high speed. Past studies showed that the contribution from the hysteresis component in comparison to adhesion has a larger influence on the friction measurements. This research aims to develop a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical model in the finite element (FE) framework to determine the progressive temperature development in a pneumatic tire rolling over a simulated asphalt pavement surface mesh and its eventual effect on the hysteretic friction. This research also studies the hysteretic frictional behavior of a test tire under different surrounding temperature conditions. In this methodology, first, the tire is tested under static loading conditions to obtain its overall deformation characteristics and in particular the relation tire load - inflation pressure – foot print. In the second step, rubber material tests are performed to determine the rheological characteristics of the tire tread rubber. The test results are used for the determination of rheological parameters of a tire rubber material in the form of Prony’s coefficients. The Prony’s coefficients are later utilized in the development of a 3 D FE test tire. In the third step, the tire is modelled in the FE framework, accounting for the different components of a tire like tread, side wall, carcass, belts, <b>plies,</b> <b>inner</b> liner, rim etc. The FE simulation results corresponding to the footprint and the deformation are compared with the measurements of static load deflection tests. The FE mesh of a given asphalt pavement surface is developed based on scanned asphalt surface data obtained by a Laser Profilometer and an X-ray tomographer. A dynamic analysis of a tire rolling at a definite slip ratio over a simulated asphalt pavement surface is performed. The results obtained from this analysis are used in the subsequent energy dissipation analysis to determine the heat fluxes. These heat fluxes are the input of a heat transfer analysis to determine the temperature development in the body of a tire. Many past experimental studies showed that the tire-pavement friction values are related to the tire surrounding conditions such as pavement temperature, ambient temperature, contained air temperature and surface characteristic of pavement. Therefore, in this research, the effect of pavement temperature, ambient temperature and contained air temperature on friction measurements is studied. By using the developed FE model, practical test conditions of fully and partially skidding tires traversing over different asphalt pavement surfaces, namely, Porous Asphalt, Ultra-Thin Surface and Stone Mastic Asphalt and AC- 10 are analysed. Emphasis is placed on the determination of tire tread temperature as a critical combination of pavement temperature and ambient temperature. An attempt has also been made to determine the time required for different regions of a rolling tire to reach an effective temperature equilibrated state. Such kind of analysis gives insight into the effect of thermal behaviour of different components of tire on the tire hysteresis which eventually decides its frictional performance. This research also deals with the cornering frictional behaviour of a pneumatic tire. By utilizing the developed FE model, the cornering friction was computed for inflation pressure, wheel load, vehicle speed, side-slip angle, surface texture and mix design. Good pavement macrotexture has a direct influence on the vehicle safety during wet weather conditions by improving its traction/braking ability. Apart from the macrotexture, there are several factors that affect the wet friction, such as, environmental, tire and pavement related characteristics. In recent years, development of powerful finite element tools made it possible to simulate complex wet tire-pavement interaction as close as possible to the actual field conditions. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, none of the past analytical/numerical studies were able to include the asphalt pavement surface texture in their analysis. In the next part of this thesis, the loss of friction under wet/flooded pavement conditions is studied. This research presents an FE approach to study the effect of surface morphology of asphalt pavements on the wet friction coefficient. The wet friction performance of different asphalt surface morphologies of open-graded mix to close-graded mix are studied by using the developed FE model. The tire-wet asphalt surface interaction FE model is duly calibrated with the field investigations conducted by using the state-of-art field equipment. The extreme loss of wet friction which ultimately leads to risk of hydroplaning is also studied. The FE simulations are performed on different water film thicknesses, tread pattern and different tire slip ratios and yaw angles. The results from the current study can be used as safety indicators of in-service asphalt pavements under wet/flooded conditions. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
