Different cultures such as the Tamil, Urdu, Bantu and others express their courtesy for others through their language and customs vary with culture. Social status and gender is marked through individual's etiquette practices. The older one is or depending upon their position within society (politics especially) and the family comes from projects respect from others and dignity for one's culture. Families in rural areas have special customs in which they greet each other and show appreciation.

The youngest children must make way for their elders around the home allowing them to come through. If one is said to be rude it is considered a big deal.|$|E

40|$|In Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), nodes {{are capable}} of {{frequently}} changing their location. For effective routing, each and every node is expected {{to keep track of}} its moving neighborhood. So whenever the neighbor node changes, all the other nodes should update its routing table <b>to</b> invalidate <b>the</b> paths passing though old neighbors. This prevents the node from sending future packets to a node which is now not its neighbor, and thus preventing loss of packets. When network is highly dynamic neighborhood management becomes more important. Every node broadcasts a beacon, often known as HELLO packet, so that its neighbors may record its presence. Broadcasting HELLO packets consumes node energy. In this project work an alternative method for HELLO messaging is proposed to save energy and increase the throughput. Instead of constantly sending <b>the</b> <b>hello</b> packets <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> nodes for a specific time period. Otherwise <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> <b>hello</b> packets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nodes which are in active state, this method conserves the energy, eliminating <b>the</b> <b>hello</b> packets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broken links...|$|R
