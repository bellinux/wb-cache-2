5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|During dialogue, diction <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character's social background: Sumardjo {{writes that}} Marsiti speaks {{as a poor}} {{villager}} with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead.

5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> activation energy needed {{to form the}} transition state which then decays into products.

Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E

5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the translation of the toxin <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E

5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds {{to the value of}} the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E
