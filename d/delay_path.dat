The {{delay in}} the shortest weight path may be much larger than delay in the shortest <b>delay</b> <b>path</b> from a sender to a receiver. For delay sensitive applications, we investigate the possibility of adding proxies in networks to make the delay in the overlay path between senders and receivers close to the delay in shortest <b>delay</b> <b>path</b> and to reduce the delays from senders to receivers. By solving the integer linear programming formulations developed on the overlay logical network, we get optimization results: number of optimal proxies, optimal proxy locations and the improvement in reducing delays from senders to receivers. We also apply Dijkstra’s algorithm on the overlay logical network to explore the maximum benefit of placing proxies on reducing delays. From simulation results of 6 ISP networks, we observe that adding proxies significantly reduces the delay from senders to receivers for some networks. Finally, we identified a network metric, Default Delay Minimum Delay Ratio(DDMDR), which will provide guidance on whether adding proxies will significantly reduce the delays from senders to receivers in a network.
