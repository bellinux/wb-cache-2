With the advent of the BC Liberal government in 2001, and its limited funding of public schools, school districts gradually eliminated many schools' music programs, redirecting scant funds to provide urgently needed ESL training.|$|E
25|$|Amos Bronson Alcott, {{a teacher}} {{and member of the}} New England Non-Resistance Society, {{came up with the idea}} of Fruitlands in 1841. He {{traveled}} to England the following year, where he hoped to find support and people to participate with him in the experiment. England was home to his strongest group of supporters, a group of <b>educators</b> <b>who</b> had founded the Alcott House, a school based on his philosophy of teaching. One of his supporters was Charles Lane, who journeyed with him to the United States on 21 October 1842.|$|E
25|$|Cijevschi's {{parliamentary}} mandate expired on November 27, 1918, {{after which}} he withdrew from national politics. Still involved with the Moldavian Veterans' Association, and employed for a while by the Chișinău Community Bank, he worked mainly as a civil servant for the Mayor of Chișinău, supervising the local schools. His activity was primarily focused on the Art Academy, which he helped refurbish. Under his watch, the school employed <b>educators</b> <b>who</b> were frowned upon in Romania for their alleged communist sympathies. He dabbled in fiction writing: the short story Unei prietene ("To a Lady Friend") was published by Viața Basarabiei magazine in 1934.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} of being sexually victimized and taken advantage of. <b>Educators</b> <b>who</b> hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how to say no, teaching them of the risks of being victims and educate them about risks and diseases of being sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{families}} of manual alphabets used for representing the Latin alphabet {{in the modern}} world. The more common of the two is mostly produced on one hand, and {{can be traced back}} to alphabetic signs used in Europe from at least the early 15th century. The alphabet, first described completely by Spanish monks, was adopted by the Abbé de l'Épée's deaf school in Paris in the 18th century, and was then spread to deaf communities around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries via <b>educators</b> <b>who</b> had learned it in Paris. Over time, variations have emerged, brought about by natural phonetic changes that occur over time, adaptions for local written forms with special characters or diacritics (which are sometimes represented with the other hand), and avoidance of handshapes that are considered obscene in some cultures. The most widely used modern descendant is the American manual alphabet.|$|E
25|$|One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is {{a method}} of {{education}} for young children that stresses {{the development of a}} child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, The Montessori Method, presents the method in detail. <b>Educators</b> <b>who</b> followed this model set up special environments {{to meet the needs of}} students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.|$|E

25|$|At that time, the Wicking Library was the school's newest wing. The {{library in}} the parking lot did not satisfy <b>educators</b> <b>who</b> thought that a library could be the center of {{instructional}} activity. In addition, many classrooms in the school needed upgrading and the music facilities were poor. The plan to solve these problems showed a small addition on the left, a new hallway across the rear of the plant, and rooms surrounding the library. The music department would get two big practice rooms and a classroom. A large two-story structure was planned to surround the library. When the plans were revealed, everyone was happy that the definitely modern building would be {{around the corner from the}} traditional Georgian Facade. In September 1973, the new wing was completed. South now had first-class science labs and social studies classrooms, appropriately naming the new addition the “S-Building.” In addition to the new classrooms, South gained a new 116-seat lecture hall.|$|E
25|$|School of Education (Concurrent Education, English) In September 2003, Laurentian began {{offering}} an English bachelor of education. This concurrent B.Ed. is a four or five-year program taken {{along with an}} undergraduate degree. The primary goal of the English-language bachelor of education program is to foster {{the development of a}} new generation of reflective <b>educators</b> <b>who</b> employ holistic teaching approaches. The curriculum features an emphasis on equity and diversity as well as the infusion of aboriginal issues and content. At the moment, the program is offered in just two of the three areas of potential concentration: the primary/junior and junior/intermediate divisions. A new school of education building - based on sustainable environmental principles and located across from L'École des sciences at the east end of the campus – was completed in the summer of 2008. The program requires a 75% average over one's first four years (weighted 12.5/12.5/37.5/37.5) in order to progress to the final (or Pro Year). The 75% minimum average required for entry in the final year means a nearly 80% entering grade in reality, so the annual Pro Year class (ranging from about 65 to 95 students) constitutes a rather elite cohort compared to most other Ontario concurrent programs. Many graduates have gone on to employment with both the local Sudbury boards, with other school boards across Ontario, while many others have acquired employment in Alberta, B.C., and Saskatchewan, with a significant number working overseas (particularly in Britain).|$|E

[...] Her viewpoints on radical politics, her [...] "stinging attack" [...] against Barnard in Token Learning, and a budget cut at the college led to her being dismissed on December 23, 1968. Her artwork was featured in an exhibit at Greenwich Village's Judson Gallery. During these years Millett became interested in the peace and Civil Rights Movement, joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and participated in their protests.|$|E

500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what all the fuss was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. <b>Educators</b> <b>who</b> had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E
