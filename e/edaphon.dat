50|$|Soil {{biology is}} the study of {{microbial}} and faunal activity and ecology in soil.Soil life, soil biota, soil fauna, or <b>edaphon</b> is a collective term that encompasses all organisms that spend a significant portion of their life cycle within a soil profile, or at the soil-litter interface.These organisms include earthworms, nematodes, protozoa, fungi, bacteria and different arthropods. Soil biology plays a vital role in determining many soil characteristics. The decomposition of organic matter by soil organisms has an immense influence on soil fertility, plant growth, soil structure, and carbon storage. As a relatively new science, much remains unknown about soil biology and its effect on soil ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a literature review, examinig {{the effect of}} agricultural and nutritional measures on soil biological activity. Bachelor thesis is systematically divided into several parts. At {{the beginning of the}} thesis are included important dates regarding soil organic matter and <b>edaphon.</b> Another part of the work has been to study effects of fertilization and liming on soil biological activity. Furthermore, there are studies on the impact of agro-technical measures and the impact of the application of pesticides. The paper also lists methods of research soil biological activity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) are the {{important}} mutualistic symbionts {{of the soil}} <b>edaphon</b> in most agro-ecosystems. The present experiment was conducted in 2011 - 2012 to investigate the AM fungal status (AM root colonization, AM spore count and AM diversity) of fifteen ornamental flowering plants. AM root colonization ranged from 14. 28 ± 2. 08 to 100. 00 ± 0. 0 percent and AM spores in the rhizospheric soil of different ornamental plants also varied significantly. Maximum AM root colonization and spore count was observed in Senecio cineraria (100. 00 ± 0. 0) and Gladiolus grandiflorus (172. 00 ± 4. 35) respectively. Twenty three different species of AM fungi belonging to five genera i. e. Glomus, Acaulospora, Sclerocystis, Gigaspora and Entrophospora were reported. Glomus {{was reported to be}} dominant genera followed by Acaulospora. The study confirmed that biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi differ in different plant species...|$|E
40|$|The hypothesis, whether {{autochthonous}} {{species of}} soil biota {{are able to}} decompose litter from lower vegetation zones in higher zones, was tested by field trial. Litterbags with litter of beech (. i. Fagus sylvatica. /i. L.) and/or oak (. i. Quercus robur. /i. L.) were exposed in beech and spruce forest on the mountain Kleť (Protected Landscape Area Blanský les). Litterbags layout simulated vegetation zones shift to the higher altitude induced by global warming. There were used litterbags with three different mesh size (42 µm, 0, 5 mm, 2 mm) for exclusion of certain parts of <b>edaphon.</b> Several changes of soil bacteria and micromycetes, oribatid mites, springtails and gamasid mites were studied during two years of exposition. There were exposed 480 litterbags {{at the start of}} the experiment (November 2002). After 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 months of exposition parts of all litterbags were recovered. Immediately after the sampling litter pH(KCl), moisture and mass loss were measured...|$|E
40|$|Surface mining of coal in {{the country}} leaves a lot of damage. This type of mining is {{characterized}} by the creation of large external dumps. The dumps often contain substrates with toxic substances or substances which become toxic after reaction with air. These substrates are toxic to plants and <b>edaphon.</b> This work is intended to show what properties of substrates are important for phytotoxicity. The location of research was selected including 3 different kinds of substrates, terrain unevenness and a lagoon in the middle. Coordinate grid has been created on the selected location. At each point a test was conducted with plant Sinapis alba and biomass was extracted from a naturally growing vegetation. Further, at the points substrates were collected and values of pH, conductivity and arsenic were measured. Test with plant Sinapis alba was repeated in the laboratory conditions as well. On site GPS coordinates were measured for the mathematical model created in ArcGIS. Experiment has shown the importance of the type of substrate and the geologic description, and then the association between dejection, value of pH and conductivity. Conductivity and pH levels also correlate with the germination Sinapis alba and biomass of naturally growing vegetation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of different rates of organic fertilizers (farmyard manure and bio sludge) on occurrence of soil organisms with focus to species of family Carabidae. During 2001 - 2003, samples of biological material were collected using the earth trap method. Samples were taken from five treatments (i) unfertilized, (ii) 25 t ha- 1 farmyard manure, (iii) 50 t ha- 1 bio sludge, (iv) 50 t ha- 1 farmyard manure, (v) 100 t ha- 1 bio sludge) which cover area of 9 000 m 2 at experimental farm of Slovak Agricultural University Kolíňany. Totally 59 054 individuals of soil <b>edaphon</b> belong to 23 epigeic groups was collected from which 25 species totally 21 189 individuals belong to the target group Carabidae. The attributes of specific identity according Jaccard (IA) ranged from 45. 45 to 71. 43 % and those of dominant identity (ID) from 94. 20 to 97. 72 %. The attributes of diversity (d) achieved a level from 0. 5406 to 0. 8986. Harpalus rufipes (De Geer, 1774) occurring on arid to damp soil, mostly in light places, was determined as the dominant species. The attributes of individual treatments are influenced by the quantity of organic mater inputs into soil that affects the formation of well-defined communities with the characteristic species composition. A comparison of individual treatments in terms of the occurrence of zooedaphon showed that application of 100 t ha- 1 bio sludge create the most suitable soil condition for zooedaphon development...|$|E
40|$|The author kept 108 algal strains (Cyanophyta 53, Chlorophyta 35, Chrysophyta 20), of axenic {{cultures}} {{from the}} Kol-Algotheca in the Botanical Division of the Hungarian National Sciences Museum in the Baradla Cave, at Aggletek (Hungary) in darkness for 204 - 420 days under different environmental conditions. The experiments have proven that several algal strains can tolerate well the {{complete absence of}} light. Furthermore, that some algal strains show intensive development even under such conditions. These axenic cultures kept in the cave in metal boxes on inorganic medium {{have shown that the}} energy source used by these green coloured algae is not some by-product of chemotrophic bacteria, nor is it available organic material, but that it must be some kind of radiation which is able to penetrate even the metal boxes. The ability to adapt to the conditions existing in a cave is not a general characteristic of algal species, but is the capability of individual algal strains within that species. Most probably the algae living in the caves are aerophytes, terrestrial forms, and also some belonging to the <b>edaphon.</b> The cells were found to be smaller in the algae kept in the cave, there was almost no starch deposition in the cells, the pyrenoids were barely discernible, but the development of carotenes was more intense. Whether there are specific cave dwelling algal strains must be determined by future algological research conducted in caves. The composition of the algal floras of the caves may be equally dependent upon the chemical and physical characteristics of the biotope, {{as is the case in}} every other biotope...|$|E
40|$|To {{this day}} are terminological {{inaccuracies}} in subject publications, which direct us to wrong deductions. Therefore I devote oneself to literature search about soil organic matter, in my theses. Separately is split primary organic matter, levels of it´s lability and stable humus. I clarify the term stability {{and the difference}} in humus and primary soil organic matter. In this theses were effected analyses acid cambi soil in region Czech Budejovice and acid cambi soil in range of Bohemian Forest ? Kubova Huť. Was quantificated content HK, FK, Cox, humification degree SH, mineralized carbon Cminer, speed constant of biochemical oxidation C, fraction of labile organic substance Ccws, Chws, a CPM. I had compared this data with data, which we keep at one´s disposal from analyses effected twelve years ago. By comparing the real quality of humus in samples A (Kubova Huť) and B (České Budějovice) it stands to reason, that the B sample is superior in quality than sample A. Practice and media very often consider as ?humus? total content of Cox. If this thought should be the true, I would have to consider sample A (with content 9, 3 % Cox) as a soil with high level of humus and I would expect record returns in it. This conclusion would be real absurd. We can not talk about humus according to Cox content only. It is also necessary to take the primary claims (that the content Chws is an indicator of soil fertility) of some big men in field of pedology (for example Haynes) {{with a grain of}} salt. This applies only if soil micro ? <b>edaphon</b> is not decimated somehow. I came to the conclusions, that the final result of the analyses, effected by my thesis supervisor (Kolář) twelve years ago, on practically identical soil samples, are almost exactly the same with my results...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the dangers of {{acidification}} of the soil in our conditional environment, and the related events that have a negative reflection on the entire ecosystem, including the socio-economic consequences for the entire community as well. It describes the causes of soil acidification, its primary markers, and the negative impact on the soil environment, plants, and <b>edaphon.</b> Soil reaction plays an important role, and bears evidence {{of the quality of the}} soil in a given location. The dangers the soil acidification introduces do not only affect the field of agriculture, but is significant from an ecological perspective, where we can assess the influence of acidification on the environment. An increase in soil acidity leads to leaching of nutrients from the soil, increased mobilisation of toxic substances, a disruption of natural microbiological processes in the soil, it enhances the effect of other degradational processes, and the loss of the natural processes of the soil is often irreversible. The effect of calcium on the soil and its role in plants' ability to absorb nutrients is also examined. The work also deals with how to neutralise acidic soil, in which the application of calcium on agricultural soil plays the most important role. The effect of calcium changes the characteristics of the soil, such as soil fertility, soil reaction, availability of nutrients, biological activity, and others. Since the 1980 s, there has been a significant decrease in the use of calcium products. This study evaluated the results of agrochemical testing of agricultural soils for the past twenty years, in which the results show a clear, continuing decreasing trend in pH development. The conclusion focuses on an assessment of the information, an evaluation of influences, and recommendations for corrective and preventative measures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the future}} {{the amount of}} farm {{subsidies}} is no more yield dependent. As a following the optimum of the production function is shifted from yield optimisation to costs minimisation. This forces organic farmers to reduce production costs, because marginal profit of yield increase {{is lower than the}} costs of the marginal factor input to raise the yield. Direct drilling proofed to save costs in mainstream cereal production under application of chemical weed and pest control. Expensive weed control in organic farming is the main reason why direct drilling technique in organic farming is hardly applied. The aim of the project is to develop a suitable direct drilling technology for organic cereal production under Finnish conditions that guarantees 1. Reasonable weed control, 2. Reduced traffic, 3. Improved soil structure, 4. Cost savings, 5. High cereal quality. Material and methods: Cereals will be drilled into white clover at the organic research farm of MTT Agricultural Engineering Research in Vihti. Some annual subcrop will also be tested. The experiment will be conducted with spring and winter cereals. At least the following four variants are tested: Direct drilling after ploughing, direct drilling after mowing of white clover, mowing of white clover after direct drilling and direct drilling without mowing of white clover. The project is divided into five work packages: 1. Direct drilling technology: Within this work package all technical aspects of the project are handled. Both spring cereal and winter cereal experiments will be established at Vihti. Four treatments are applied with five replications on 25 m* 3 m sized plots. The knowledge, which is obtained in MTT's project: "Direct drilling of spring cereals", will be utilized during this study. 2. Weed control: Within this work package quantity and distribution of weeds is recorded. Perennial weeds are regarded as major threat in cereal production, particularly in organic farming in Finland. The most common and harmful species are Elymus repens, Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis. During the growing period weed survey is conducted, weeds are counted and their dry matter mass is measured. 3. Soil structure: Within this work package quality of soil structure is recorded: Profile of tilled soil, soil odour, soil colour, soil crumb, soil layers, organic material, root development, soil surface and earth worm activities. 4. Crop management and quality: Organic cereal (mainly barley) production often suffers from protein quality. Beside a carefully planned crop rotation under sowing of legumes or legume blends e. g. during row harrowing can solve the problem. Because nitrogen is considered as the limiting factor in respect of quality and yield of organically produced cereals, simultaneous cultivation of cereals and legumes may support nitrogen nutrition. The following data will be collected: Growing stages and root development, yield, harvest index and grain quality in terms of protein quantity, thousand-grain weight, hectolitre weight and falling number, biological activity in terms of mass of <b>edaphon,</b> respiration, mineralisation of organic material, activity of enzymes, amino acid concentration, number of earthworms, environmental pollution in terms of N 2 O and NH 4 emission, biodiversity in terms of weed societies and diversity of fauna. 5. The economy of direct drilling in organic farming: The production costs of cereals will be calculated in direct drilling, in conventional tillage and also in minimum-tillage. This cannot be done untill yield and weed data has been obtained. All parameters above are recorded and analysed and concluded for further development of direct drilling techniques. Organic farmers and direct drilling equipment manufacturers will apply the results...|$|E
