This paper focuses on the design of a channeladaptive QoS-supporting framework for radio resource management in WiMAX networks with <b>fixed</b> <b>subscriber</b> stations. The base station generates resource grants on the basis of (i) flowbased bandwidth requests, (ii) monitored link conditions to each subscriber station, and (iii) minimum resource requirements by high-demanding flows. A compensation technique that mitigates the negative effects caused by impairments on the radio channel is also presented. The effectiveness of the proposed solution in supporting both inter-class traffic QoS differentiation and intraclass fairness is demonstrated through simulations...|$|E

To fully explore the benefits of adopting relay stations (RSs), a vital issue is the placement of RSs by jointly considering an advanced coding scheme. In this paper, we aim to provide a general framework for solving the minimum cost RS placement problem in 802. 16 j Mobile Multi-hop Relay (MMR) networks. We first introduce a novel dual-relay architecture, where all the users, i. e., the mobile stations (MSs) and the <b>fixed</b> <b>subscriber</b> stations (SSs), are connected to the BS via two active RSs through decoded-and-forwarding scheme. We will then demonstrate that the most significant advantages of the dual-relay architecture lie in the ability of achieving high throughput for the systems. In addition, the users can be subject to better fault tolerance, robustness, and power saving. We formulate the dualrelay RS placement problem, and solve it through a two-phase algorithm to deal with the NP-hardness. Numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance gain due to cooperative RS placement in the proposed framework, and demonstrate that the proposed approach can lead to a well acceptable solution compared with that by exhaustively searching. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This follows NASA's earlier involvement in the FCC's 1994 Negotiated Rule Making Committee which studied frequency sharing between Ka-band Fixed Satellite Services and LMDS in the 27. 5 - to 29. 5 -GHz band. LMDS is a terrestrial, cellular, wireless communication service primarily intended to provide television distribution from hub stations located within relatively small cells to <b>fixed</b> <b>subscriber</b> receivers.

40|$|FMS (fixed-to-mobile substitution) has {{increasingly}} been echoed within the regulatory {{agenda of the}} global and domestic policy actors as the usage of mobile telephony has rapidly exceeded that of the fixed telephony in the last decade. In this line of thinking and upon the drastic changes in market figures, e. g., diminishing <b>fixed</b> <b>subscriber</b> number and traffic, Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA), regulatory authority in Turkey has had a survey carried out {{across the country in}} 2013, primarily to evaluate the degree of FMS. The survey results demonstrated the existence of one-sided (or imperfect) FMS, which has been found to influence fixed access and calling markets so as to ensure that these two markets are more competitive under a forward-looking approach. Moreover, ICTA has advanced the wholesale regulations within the context of fixed call origination market by imposing margin squeeze remedy on the fixed incumbent (SMP operator). While the latter step is criticized as being in conflict with the deregulation decision, the nature of the remedy being on ex post basis could be speculated to eliminate the concerns to an extent. Aggravating the discussion, an interesting development during the course of ICTA 2 ̆ 019 s intervention has happened in January 2015 when the SMP operator has increased its two retail prices so as to rearrange the margins. In this context, two questions arise from the discussions which extend to the philosophy of market regulation and deregulation: (i) First, does the regulator have a responsibility to pursue a regular (although being ex post) way of examining and when necessary intervening the incumbent 2 ̆ 019 s retail prices despite the fact Competition Authority has opened investigations several times on the same issue. (ii) Would the exposed degree of FMS have had a driving role for deregulation of fixed access and calling markets, which are freed from regulation including margin squeeze remedy on a different route across EU, i. e. mostly inner-market (or VOB-driven) developments towards effective competition. In this paper, such debates are addressed under the light of the reasons that justify margin squeeze as well as deregulation acts issued both by the Turkish regulator itself and in general way of regulatory understanding, i. e. with a particular emphasis to EU perspective and implementation. It is elaborated whether the underlined concerns relating to the degree of market regulation are successfully sorted out and translated into regulatory practice, specifically when thought with Turkey-centric competition problems, i. e. predominant WLR type service-based models, diminishing fixed markets. After discussions, it is found that although belatedly imposed and accompanied by deregulation, such a remedy would serve as a check-balance tool for a transition period, but not suffice to cover all the long-term problems by itself in cases where competing operators have insufficient competitive tools in terms of replicability. Last but not the least it is concluded that although European way of deregulation draws a differing roadmap, EU-centric pillars for regulation are implicitly injected into the Turkish system, which tries to resolve the issue with a trade-off together with the little possibility of ruling in a regulatory vacuum. Should this and a comparable risk of regulatory opportunism be prevented, a hybrid and promising example would be mentioned under the context of deregulatory reform...|$|E
40|$|Third {{generation}} {{mobile communication}} systems promise a greater data rate and new {{services to the}} mobile subscribers. 3 G systems support up to 2 Mbps of data rate to a <b>fixed</b> <b>subscriber</b> and 144 Kbps of data rate to a fully mobile subscriber. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the air interface access scheme widely used in all the 3 G communication systems. This access scheme has many inherent advantages m terms of noise immunity, security, coherent combining of multi path signals etc. But all these advantages {{come at the expense}} of higher complexity of the receivers. The receivers form the major portion of the processing involved in a base station. The heart of any CDMA receiver is the RAKE. The RAKE receiver separates the different multi-paths received by the antenna by using the properties of the Pseudo Random sequences. The phase and strength of each of these path signals is measured and are used by the coherent combiner, which de-rotates all the signals to a single reference and coherently combines them In general the Base station receivers make use of the top three multi-path signals ranked in terms of their signal energy Hence four RAKE fingers, each catering to single multi-path are needed for receiving a single code channel (3 for coherent combining and one for scanning). One such channel receiver requires a processing power of 860 MIPS (Mega Instructions Per Second). Some of the CDMA standards support up to 90 code channels at the same time. This means that the total processing power required at the base station is about 80 GIPS. This much of processing power will require large number of high end DSPs, which will be a very costly solution. In the current base station architectures these blocks are implemented using ASICs, which are specific to a particular standard and also the algorithms used for the different operations are fixed at the design time itself. This solution is not flexible and is not amenable for SDR (Software defined Radio) architectures for the Base stations. This thesis proposes a Co-Processor solution, which can be attached to a generic DSP or any other processor. The processor can control the Co-Processor by programming its parameter registers using memory mapped register accesses. This co-processor implements only those blocks, which are compute intensive. This co-processor performs all chip-rate processing functions involved m a RAKE receiver. All the symbol-rate functions are implemented through software in the processor. This provides more choices m selecting the algorithms for timing recovery and scanning. The algorithms can be changed through software even after the base station is installed in the field. All the inputs and outputs of the Co-Processor are passed through dual port RAMs with independent read and write clocks. This allows the Co-Processor and the processor to be running on two independent clocks. This memory scheme also increases the throughput as the reads and writes to these memories can happen simultaneously. This thesis introduces a concept of incorporating programmable PN/Gold code generators as part of the Co-Processor, which significantly reduces the amount of memory required to store the Scrambling and Spreading codes. The polynomial lengths as well as the polynomials of the code generator are programmable. The input signal memory has a bus width equal to 4 times the bus width of the IQ signal bus width (4 * 24 = 96 bits) towards the Co-Processor to meet the huge data bandwidth requirement. This memory is arranged as word interleaved memory banks. This can supply one word per memory bank on each clock cycle as long as the accessed words fall in different memory banks. The number of banks is chosen as more than twice that of the number of Correlators/ Rake fingers. This gives more flexibility in choosing the address offsets to different Correlator inputs. This flexibility allows one to use different timing recovery schemes since the number of allowable address offsets for different Correlators is more. The overall complexity of the solution is comparatively less with respect to the generic DSP based solution and much easier to modify for a different standard, when compared to the rigid ASIC based solution. The proposed solution is significantly different from the conventional way of designing the Base station with fixed ASICs and it clearly outweighs the solutions based on conventional approach in terms of flexibility, design complexity, design time and cost...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — WiMax {{broadband}} MAN {{based on}} the IEEE 802. 16 d/e standard supports mobile as well as fixed wireless access services. Both types of subscriber data links are characterized by totally different radio conditions such as e. g. propagation, interference rejection capability, terminal antenna gain, pattern and height. This leads to a significant coverage mismatch, different user application throughput and varying system capacity. Especially the mixture of both mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>subscribers</b> sharing the same radio resources will consequently determine the cellular network structure, frequency planning and radio resource management. In this paper the performance of mobile and fixed WiMax data links in cellular 3. 5 GHz deployments has been thoroughly analyzed depending on cell size, frequency reuse and system load. Detailed link and network level simulations have been provided for an OFDM- 256 system with 3. 5 MHz channels deployed in homogeneous hexagonal tight 1 x 1 and 1 x 3 reuse with cell radius of 300 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m.

40|$|Numbering and {{addressing}} issues arising in the Integrated Broadband Communication Network (IBCN) {{for the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile communications services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile Customer Premises Network (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data. The exclusive use of Personal Telecommunication Numbers (PTN's) as Dialing Numbers (DN) is proposed in IBCN for UMTS and PTS. That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as <b>fixed</b> <b>subscribers.</b> When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the called subscriber.
