5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld was {{developed}} by Crystal <b>Dynamics</b> and published by Eidos Interactive as the final Tomb Raider title to be published under the Eidos Interactive label prior to its purchase by Square Enix. Different versions of the game were developed by Crystal <b>Dynamics,</b> Buzz Monkey Software, Nixxes Software and Santa Cruz Games, all published by Eidos Interactive. Crystal <b>Dynamics</b> developed the Xbox 360 version and collaborated with Nixxes Software for the PC and PlayStation 3 versions. Santa Cruz Games developed the Nintendo DS version, while the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions were developed by Buzz Monkey Software. The Mac version {{was developed}} by Crystal <b>Dynamics</b> and released by Feral Interactive.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle and {{motorcycle}} <b>dynamics</b> is {{the science}} of the motion of bicycles and motorcycles and their components, due to the forces acting on them. <b>Dynamics</b> falls under a branch of physics known as classical mechanics. Bike motions of interest include balancing, steering, braking, accelerating, suspension activation, and vibration. The study of these motions {{began in the late}} 19th century and continues today.|$|E
5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble <b>dynamics,</b> also usually by {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble <b>dynamics</b> are varied. They range from {{those that are not}} much more complex than the dissolved phase models, to those that require considerably greater computational power.|$|E

25|$|Forrester was {{the founder}} of system <b>dynamics,</b> which deals with the {{simulation}} of interactions between objects in dynamic systems. Industrial <b>Dynamics</b> was the first book Forrester wrote using system <b>dynamics</b> to analyze industrial business cycles. Several years later, interactions with former Boston Mayor John F. Collins led Forrester to write Urban <b>Dynamics,</b> which sparked an ongoing debate on the feasibility of modeling broader social problems.|$|E
25|$|Neutral <b>dynamics</b> may be {{relatively}} important in some cases, {{depending on the}} species, environmental conditions and the spatial and temporal scale level under consideration, whereas in other circumstances, niche <b>dynamics</b> may dominate. Thus niche and neutral <b>dynamics</b> may be operating simultaneously, constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.|$|E
25|$|Inverse <b>dynamics</b> is {{an inverse}} problem. It {{commonly}} refers to either inverse rigid body <b>dynamics</b> or inverse structural <b>dynamics.</b> Inverse rigid-body <b>dynamics</b> {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse <b>dynamics</b> derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse <b>dynamics</b> computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.|$|E

25|$|In physics one {{separates}} {{the laws of}} motion, called kinematics, from the laws of force, called <b>dynamics.</b> Following the classical kinematics of Newton's laws of motion, the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built {{in such a way}} that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the <b>dynamics.</b> In other words, if the <b>dynamics</b> are invariant, then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant; if the <b>dynamics</b> is not, then the kinematics will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we examine these next.|$|E

25|$|The urban <b>dynamics</b> model {{attracted}} the attention of urban planners around the world, eventually leading Forrester to meet a founder of the Club of Rome. He later met with the Club of Rome to discuss issues surrounding global sustainability; the book World <b>Dynamics</b> followed. World <b>Dynamics</b> took on modeling the complex interactions of the world economy, population and ecology, which was controversial (see also Donella Meadows and Limits to Growth). It was the start of the field of global modeling. Forrester continued working in applications of system <b>dynamics</b> and promoting its use in education.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} motion {{can be divided}} into {{kinematics}} and <b>dynamics.</b> Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of <b>dynamics</b> are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct <b>dynamics</b> refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct <b>dynamics</b> is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse <b>dynamics</b> refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} molecular <b>dynamics,</b> {{one potential}} energy surface (usually the ground state) {{is represented in}} the force field. This {{is a consequence of}} the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as density functional theory. This is named Ab Initio Molecular <b>Dynamics</b> (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular <b>dynamics.</b> This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} from a fully quantum description to {{a classical}} potential entails two main approximations. The {{first one is}} the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which states that the <b>dynamics</b> of electrons are so fast {{that they can be}} considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian <b>dynamics.</b> In classical molecular <b>dynamics,</b> the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.|$|E

25|$|Surface hopping {{is a mixed}} quantum-classical {{technique}} that incorporates quantum mechanical effects into molecular <b>dynamics</b> simulations. Traditional molecular <b>dynamics</b> assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the lighter electrons adjust instantaneously to {{the motion of the}} nuclei. Though the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applicable {{to a wide range of}} problems, there are several applications, such as photoexcited <b>dynamics,</b> electron transfer, and surface chemistry where this approximation falls apart. Surface hopping partially incorporates the non-adiabatic effects by including excited adiabatic surfaces in the calculations, and allowing for 'hops' between these surfaces, subject to certain criteria.|$|E
