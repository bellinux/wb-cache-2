Thus, in 1962, Yamakawa completed the corrected chemical structure of sulfatide.|$|E

Against the epimastigote form in vitro, mevinolin produced a dose-dependent reduction of the growth rate up to 25,uM, but at 50 and 75,uM, complete growth arrest and cell lysis took place after 144 and 96 h, respectively. A systematic study of the effects of mevinolin combined with ketoconazole and terbinafine, which act at different points in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, on the proliferation of epimastigotes indicated a synergic action, as shown by concave isobolograms and fractional inhibitory concentration indexes ranging from 0. 17 to 0. 54.

In this study, membrane activity and lipid composition of the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio sp. DSM 14379, grown aerobically in a peptone-yeast extract medium supplemented with 0. 5, 1. 76, 3, 5 or 10 % (w/v) NaCl, was determined. The ability of the membrane to reduce a spin label was studied by EPR spectroscopy under different salt concentrations in cell suspensions labeled with TEMPON. For lipid composition studies, cells were harvested in a late exponential phase and lipids were extracted with chloroform–methanol–water, 1 : 2 : 0. 8 (v/v). The lipid polar head group and acyl chain compositions were determined by thin-layer and <b>gas–liquid</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> 31 P-NMR spectroscopy was used to study the phase behaviour of the cell lipid extracts with 20 wt. % water contents in a temperature range from − 10 to 50 °C. The {{results indicate that the}} ability of the membrane to reduce the spin label was highest at optimal salt concentrations. The composition of both polar head groups and acyl chains changed markedly with increasing salinity. The fractions of 16 : 0, 16 : 1 and 18 : 0 acyl chains increased while the fraction of 18 : 1 acyl chains decreased with increasing salinity. The phosphatidylethanolamine fraction correlated inversely with the lysophosphatidylethanolamine fraction, with phosphatidylethanolamine exhibiting a minimum, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine a maximum, at the optimum growth rate. The fraction of lysophosphatidylethanolamine was surprisingly high in the lipid extracts. This lipid can form normal micellar and hexagonal phases and it was found that all lipid extracts form a mixture of lamellar and normal isotropic liquid crystalline phases. This is an anomalous behaviour since the nonlamellar phases formed by total lipid extracts are generally of the reversed type...|$|R
