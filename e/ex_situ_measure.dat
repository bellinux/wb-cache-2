40|$|Abstract: Tasmania has {{a strong}} record of {{successful}} in situ plant conservation but {{there will always be}} a role for the integration of various <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures</b> into a plant conservation program due to pressure by threatening processes on wild populations. This paper replaces a 15 year old strategy for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation in Tasmania. Progress in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures</b> for Tasmanian plants is described and broadly evaluated against the previous strategy. Rare and threatened species are considered to be a high priority group for resources if intensive management is required. Endemic species likely to be adversely impacted by climate change would be a high priority for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation. Seed banking to capture as much genetic variation in these species is suggested. Eight <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> methods are briefly described and their application in Tasmanian instances noted. The Tasmanian Seed Conservation Centre established at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens is a central part of Tasmanian <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation efforts for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation programs.

40|$|Plantago algarbiensis and Plantago almogravensis are two {{endangered}} and {{endemic species}} from Portugal. Due to the rarity and endangered {{nature of these}} species {{as well as the}} lack of molecular data, their genetic variation was evaluated using ISSR and RAPD markers. P. algarbiensis species showed higher genetic variability (73. 9 % of polymorphism) than P. almogravensis (61. 2 %). The two species revealed a high level of genetic diversity, with a Nei's genetic diversity of 0. 1965 and 0. 2309 and a Shannon's diversity index of 0. 2975 and 0. 3520, for P. almogravensis and P. algarbiensis, respectively. A low level of genetic differentiation was observed (Gst = 0. 1873) among the species. However, the cluster and PCA analyses, based on genetic similarity, revealed two main, clearly separate clusters, which directly corresponded to the plants isolated from each species. In <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures</b> should be applied in order to preserve both species but, based on these results, P. almogravensis population should be a priority for conservation.

40|$|In a 5 -period study (2007 - 2011) we {{examined}} the effects of human trampling on the last remaining population of Anchusa littorea on the sandy coastal habitat. This species, considered extinct in the wild for several years, was casually rediscovered in a small population at Is Arenas (SW Sardinia). We monthly monitored six trampled and six untrampled permanent plots, mapping individuals and recording their size and reproductive variables. Trampled and untrampled plots showed significant differences with respect to plant density, plant size and reproductive performance (flowers and fruits production). This study demonstrated that human trampling represents a severe threat to the conservation of A. littorea and urgent measures should be planned to protect the unique remnant population in the dune system of Is Arenas. Tourist flow should be redirected and confined to others areas in order to promote the natural expansion of A. littorea in its original habitat.

40|$|For the {{investigation}} of organic carbon fluxes reaching the seafloor, oxygen microprofiles were measured at 145 sites in different sub-regions of the Southern Ocean. At 11 sites, an in situ oxygen microprofiler was deployed for the measurement of oxygen profiles and the calculation of organic carbon fluxes. At four sites, both in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> data were determined for high latitudes. Based on this data set {{as well as on}} previous published data, a relationship was established for the estimation of fluxes derived by <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measured</b> O 2 profiles. The fluxes of labile organic matter range from 0. 5 to 37. 1 mg C m&# 8722; 2 d&# 8722; 1. The high values determined by in situ measurements were observed in the Polar Front region (water depth of more than 4290 m) and are comparable to organic matter fluxes observed for high-productivity, upwelling areas like off West Africa. The oxygen penetration depth, which reflects the long-term organic matter flux to the sediment, was correlated with assemblages of key diatom species. In the Scotia Sea (not, vert, similar 3000 m water depth), oxygen penetration depths of less than 15 cm were observed, indicating high benthic organic carbon fluxes. In contrast, the oxic zone extends down to several decimeters in abyssal sediments of the Weddell Sea and the southeastern South Atlantic. The regional pattern of organic carbon fluxes derived from microsensor data suggests that episodic and seasonal sedimentation pulses are important for the carbon supply to the seafloor of the deep Southern Ocean...|$|R

Here, we examined the levels and partitioning of inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) diversity (109 loci) in five populations of this orchid to gain insight into its genetic variation and population structure in Eastern and Central China. It harbored considerably lower levels of genetic diversity both at the population (percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) = 11. 19 %, Nei’s gene diversity (H) = 0. 0416 and Shannon’s information index (I) = 0. 0613) and species level (PPL = 38. 53 %, H = 0. 1273 and I = 0. 1928) and a significantly higher degree of differentiation among populations (the proportion of the total variance among populations (Φpt) = 0. 698) than those typical of ISSR-based studies in other orchid species. Furthermore, the Nei’s genetic distances between populations were independent of the corresponding geographical distances. Two main clusters are shown in an arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendrogram, which is in agreement with the results of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) analysis and the STRUCTURE program. In addition, individuals within a population were more similar to each other than to those in other populations. Based on the genetic data and our field survey, the development of conservation management for this threatened orchid should include habitat protection, artificial gene flow and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The rainforest trees, Ocotea catharinensis, O. odorifera and O. porosa have been heavily harvested because of the high economic value of their timber and essential oils.

As a consequence, these species have suffered large declines in population size and are now considered to be potentially vulnerable to extinction. This study investigated the patterns and levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding of these species using eight microsatellite markers in order to define priority populations for conservation management actions focusing on population enhancement and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> germplasm collections.

40|$|Rhododendrons are an important, dominant, and {{primitive}} group of flowering plants with considerable ecological and economic importance {{found in the}} temperate, subalpine and alpine regions of western Arunachal Pradesh, India. In addition to aesthetic, sacred, and ethnomedicinal values, several species have commercial and social importance. Rhododendrons {{are one of the}} preferred plant species used by local inhabitants in the region. Anthropogenic disturbance associated with deforestation, unsustainable extraction, over-exploitation, and agricultural practices have collectively put pressure on Rhododendron species; as a result many species have become endangered, rare, or threatened. Knowledge of the specifics of a species’ distribution is essential for its in situ conservation and management. We focused, in this study, on four rare Rhododendron species (R. edgeworthii, R. kendrickii, R. keysii, and R. maddenii). We recorded geographic locations of the selected species through extensive field surveys, and obtained additional occurrences from secondary sources. We used a NASAMODIS/ Terra data set to summarize environmental characteristics. We incorporated location and environmental data into evolutionary-computing approaches to develop ecological niche model predictions of the likelihood of occurrence of these species. Seven new populations of the studied species were encountered in subsequent field surveys of the predicted sites. Ecological niche modeling can thus serve an important role in various in situ as well as <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures</b> for establishment of arboreta, sanctuaries, parks and reserve forests, protected areas through community management, botanical gardens, and also for in vitro research activities for species conservation...|$|R

Asian houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii is a globally threatened bird, with continuing declines across Central Asia, mainly due to unregulated hunting and trapping during migration and in winter. This research aims to improve understanding of the breeding season biology of the Asian houbara migratory populations in Central Asia to inform in-situ conservation of the species. Spring fieldwork during 2012 – 2015 involved distance sampling, nest monitoring and habitat sampling across 14, 500 km 2 of the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan. Contrary to expectations, there appeared to be no negative landscape-scale association between livestock density and the abundance of male houbara, and no grazing effect on desert shrub vegetation. Habitat characteristics selected by males at the landscape scale were more likely to maximise visibility of their displays, with higher male abundance in lower shrub vegetation, on gravelly substrate and flatter terrain. The first robust estimate of local male density stratified by different habitats and an estimate of regional numbers were obtained. Houbara nesting success was unaffected by variation in shrub species composition or livestock density, but nests placed within taller vegetation experienced greater success. Satellite-tracking revealed high site-fidelity of males to their display sites and intra-seasonal fidelity of females to breeding areas. During post-breeding dispersal adult birds were found to be using completely different, more productive in terms of vegetation, areas outside their breeding season range. In conclusion I discuss potential implications of key findings for the conservation and management of the Asian houbara population in the Kyzylkum, and their potential relevance to other houbara populations and study systems, and suggest priorities for further research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The karst {{regions in}} South China have an {{abundance}} of endemic plants that face high extinction risks. The Chinese Gesneriaceae endemic Paraisometrum mileense ( = Oreocharis mileensis), was presumed extinct for 100 years. After its re-discovery, the species {{has become one of}} five key plants selected by the Chinese forestry government to establish a new conservation category for plants with extremely small populations. For conservation purposes, we studied the phylogenetic and population genetic status of P. mileense at the three only known localities in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected 64 samples (52 species) of Oreocharis and 8 samples from three provinces of P. mileense and generated molecular phylogenies, and inferred that P. mileense represents a relatively isolated and derived taxonomic unit within Oreocharis. Phylogeographic results of 104 samples of 12 populations of P. mileense indicated that the populations in Yunnan have derived from those in Guangxi and Guizhou. Based on AFLP data, the populations were found to harbor low levels of genetic diversity (He =  0. 118), with no apparent gradient across the species' range, a restricted gene flow and significant isolation-by-distance with limited genetic differentiation among the populations across the three provinces (FST =  0. 207, P< 0. 001). The 10 populations in Yunnan were found to represent two distinct lineages residing at different altitudes and distances from villages. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The low levels of genetic diversity found in P. mileense are perhaps a consequence of severe bottlenecks in the recent past. The distribution of the genetic diversity suggests that all populations are significant for conservation. Current in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures</b> are discussed. Further conservation actions are apparently needed to fully safeguard this conservation flagship species. Our work provides a model of an integrated study for the numerous endemic species in the karst regions with extremely small populations...|$|R
40|$|Border and {{isolated}} plant populations represent an interesting target for ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the ecological constraints and the conservation {{status of the}} eastern population of Helianthemum caput-felis Boiss. (Cistaceae), located in Sardinia. The distribution of H. caput-felis was verified via field surveys; ecological data, morphological and reproductive traits, were recorded in 40 permanent plots randomly established; the human trampling effects on plant density, plant size and plant performance were analysed. Plant density was higher in bedrock and lowland areas, in garrigue and maquis habitats; however, the differences among plants growing in different ecological conditions were not statistically significant; only human trampling intensity significantly affected plant density and lowest values were observed in areas with intense trampling pressure. All ecological variables analysed had a statistically significant effect on plant size and {{on the number of}} fruits per plant. In particular, larger plants were found in areas with the following ecological features: presence of structured soil, on the slopes, in the maquis habitat, and in areas with intensive human trampling. Conversely, plants displayed a higher fruits output per plant in deep and structured soil, in lowland areas, and in the garrigue and maquis habitats; the mean fruits output per plant increased as human trampling intensified. Human-induced threats are the main hazards threatening the remaining Sardinian population. In particular, the major threats are linked to tourism and other outdoor activities (i. e. human trampling), followed by the expansion of agricultural activities; all of these threats result in the disappearance of small localities and in reduced population size due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Our study indicates that H. caput-felis should be considered as Critically Endangered (CR) at the regional level. Urgent measures should be undertaken to protect the remaining H. caput-felis population in Sardinia and a possible integrated strategy for the conservation and management consists of a combination of in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>measures.</b> In particular, greater emphasis should be given to minimizing the negative impacts of unsustainable tourism and recreation use, in order to exclude human trampling and to facilitate the plant recruitment process and population renewal.

Sponge survival was dependent on the species, experiment duration, and method of culture. For both species the highest mortality occurred within days of excision of sponge material from parent stock, and mortalities were negligible after 78 days. After 78 days, R. odorabile had highest survival <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> (75 %) and lowest in situ (60 %). In contrast, Coscinoderma sp. had the lowest survival <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> (30 %) and highest in situ (90 %). The total growth of R. odorabile (146. 0 ± 40. 3 %) and Coscinoderma sp.

Both species demonstrated initial size dependent growth rates with smaller explants growing fastest over the first 78 days. Explant recovery rates were rapid for both species with a protective layer of collagen forming over the surface within 24 h. This layer was replaced by pinacoderm between 3 and 41 days after excision as the subsurface tissue reorganised to recreate a functional surface for each species, including redevelopment of the aquiferous system within 41 days for R. odorabile. R. odorabile and Coscinoderma sp. both show potential for commercial aquaculture, however, further research is required to reduce initial mortality rates and the high variability in growth rates between explants...|$|R

Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts.

40|$|International audienceHere {{we present}} a novel {{methodology}} to measure the alkaline stability of anion conducting polymers {{to be used as}} anion exchange membranes and anion exchange ionomers for fuel cells. The new <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> technique simulates the environment of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) during operation, where nucleophilic and basic OH − species in the absence, or with a scarce amount of water, attack the functional groups of the ionic polymer. Using this technique, we clearly show the critical effect of water molecules on the alkaline stability of quaternary ammonium (QA) cations commonly used as functional groups in AEMFCs. The results show that as the water content is reduced, the QA cations are more rapidly degraded in the presence of OH − at room temperature. With an increasing number of water molecules solvating the hydroxide, its nucleophilicity and basicity are hindered, and the QA degradation is significantly slowed. These results indicate that the currently used aqueous alkali <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> tests to <b>measure</b> anion exchange membrane (AEM) stability may lead to false positive stability results where anion conducting polymers may appear more alkali stable than they really are...|$|R

The amount of genetic diversity of plant species is a valuable indicator of population, being the baseline in developing proper strategies for their conservation.  Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) markers were used to analyze polymorphism in A. liliifolia genome and to evaluate the genetic diversity and accordingly, the state of a recently identified population. Five ISSR primers, specially designed for plants, and containing different simple sequence repeat motifs were tested. A total of 52 ISSR fragments were generated of which 41 were polymorphic (78. 84 %) and 32 (61. 53 %) specific to Adenophora genus. The value of Shannon’s index of genotypic diversity was 0. 812. Jaccard similarity coefficient was calculated for pair wise comparisons among all individuals and ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 83.

We used <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> collection and threat rank data for North American angiosperms to investigate gaps in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> coverage and phylogenetic diversity of collections and to develop a flexible framework for prioritizing species across multiple objectives. We found that <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> coverage of 18, 766 North American angiosperm taxa was low with respect to the most vulnerable taxa: just 43 % of vulnerable to critically imperiled taxa were in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> collections, far short of a year- 2020 goal of 75 %. In addition, species held in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> collections were phylogenetically clustered (P < 0. 001), i. e., collections comprised less phylogenetic diversity than would be expected had species been drawn at random. These patterns support incorporating phylogenetic considerations into <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> prioritization in a manner balanced with other criteria, such as vulnerability. To meet this need, we present the 'PIECES' index (Phylogenetically Informed <b>Ex</b> <b>situ</b> Conservation of Endangered Species). PIECES integrates phylogenetic considerations into a flexible framework for prioritizing species across competing objectives using multi-criteria decision analysis. Applying PIECES to prioritizing <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation of North American angiosperms, we show strong return on investment across multiple objectives, some of which are negatively correlated with each other. A spreadsheet-based decision support tool for North American angiosperms is provided; this tool can be customized to align with different conservation objectives...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{phytochemical}} analysis [TLC method] and antioxidant {{activity of}} wild and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated shoots and tubers of Harpagophytum procumbens were done. Total phenolic content [Folin-Ciocalteu method] and free radical scavenging activity [1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl assay] of both chloroform and methanol extracts were determined. Analysis of <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated plant material showed presence of phytochemicals comparable with {{those found in}} the wild plants. The total phenolic contents (mg GAE/L) of methanolic tuber extracts from wild plants (3366 ± 22. 68) were comparable to the methanolic tuber extracts (3297. 00 ± 54. 56) from <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated plants. The total phenolic contents of methanolic leaf extracts from wild (2562 ± 158. 77) plants were also not significantly different from the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> (2686. 00 ± 10. 49) cultivated H. procumbens. Similar trends were observed in the chloroform extracts of both wild and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated H. procumbens. The free radical scavenging activities also correlated well with the total phenolic contents of both wild and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated plants. At all tested concentrations, the methanolic extracts of both wild and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated plants were ≥ 80 %. The scavenging potencies of chloroform extracts were consistently lower than the methanol extracts in both <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivated plants and wild species. The consistency in presence of phenolic compounds in these plant materials is of interest from both the pharmacological and conservation point of view given the role played by these compounds in oxidative stress. These results indicate that <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> cultivation can be both a conservation strategy and can provide an alternative and sustainable source of therapeutically active compounds...|$|R

40|$|In situ {{conservation}} {{is central to}} contemporary global biodiversity protection and is the predominant emphasis of international regulation and funding strategies. <b>Ex</b> <b>situ</b> approaches, in contrast, have been relegated to a subsidiary role and their direct contributions to conservation have been limited. We draw {{on a variety of}} sources {{to make the case for}} an enhanced role for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation. We note the advances occurring within institutions specializing in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation and stress that, although much remains to be done, many constraints are being addressed. We argue that the evidence of increasing extinction rates, exacerbated by climate change, challenges the wisdom of a heavy dependence on in situ strategies and necessitates increased development of <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> approaches. A number of different techniques that enable species and their habitats to survive should now be explored. These could build on the experience of management systems that have already demonstrated the effective integration of in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> techniques and hybrid approaches. For organizations specializing in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation to become more effective, however, they will require tangible support from the institutions of global biodiversity governance. Resistance is anticipated because in situ {{conservation is}} entrenched through powerful groups and organizations that exert influence on global conservation policy and facilitate the flow of funding. The chasm that has traditionally divided in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> approaches may diminish as approaches are combined. Moreover, the relentless loss of the ‘wild’ may soon render the in <b>situ</b> / <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> distinction misleading, or even obsolete. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} MgB 2 films were {{prepared}} by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> annealing processes respectively. Significant differences in properties {{between the two}} types of films were found. The <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> MgB 2 film has a Tc of 38. 1 K, while the in situ film has a depressed Tc of 34. 5 K. The resistivity at 40 K for the in situ film is larger than that of the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> film by a factor of 6. The residual resistivity ratios (RRR) are 1. 1 and 2. 1 for the in <b>situ</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> films respectively. The Jc-H curves of the in situ film show a much weaker field dependence than those of the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> film, attributable to stronger flux pinning in the in situ film. The small-grain feature and high oxygen level may be critical for the significant improvement of Jc in the in situ annealed MgB 2 film. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>situ</b> {{conservation}} {{strategies for}} threatened species often require long-term commitment and financial investment to achieve management objectives. We present {{a framework that}} considers the decision to adopt <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> management for a target species as the end point of several linked decisions. We used a decision tree to intuitively represent the logical sequence of decision making. The first decision is to identify the specific management actions most likely to achieve the fundamental objectives of the recovery plan, {{with or without the}} use of ex-situ populations. Once this decision has been made, one decides whether to establish an <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> population, accounting for the probability of success in the initial phase of the recovery plan, for example, the probability of successful breeding in captivity. Approaching these decisions in the reverse order (attempting to establish an <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> population before its purpose is clearly defined) can lead to a poor allocation of resources, because it may restrict the range of available decisions in the second stage. We applied our decision framework to the recovery program for the threatened spotted tree frog (Litoria spenceri) of southeastern Australia. Across a range of possible management actions, only those including <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> management were expected to provide > 50 % probability of the species' persistence, but these actions cost more than use of in situ alternatives only. The expected benefits of <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> actions were predicted to be offset by additional uncertainty and stochasticity associated with establishing and maintaining <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> populations. Na " ively implementing <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation strategies can lead to inefficient management. Our frameworkmay help managers explicitly evaluate objectives, management options, and the probability of success prior to establishing a captive colony of any given species...|$|R
