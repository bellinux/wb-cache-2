5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> book {{one can see}} {{sympathy for}} Grieban, and Greiban is {{depicted}} as a broken man, living {{out the rest of}} his years in hiding, and dying with no one around who particularly cares about him.|$|R
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the film Béart {{is dressed in}} grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E

50|$|Suho's chronicle {{runs from}} the {{creation}} of the world until 1447 (1452 in a second edition), focussing on the city of Osnabrück <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts.</b> Most of <b>the</b> text is standard material from usual sources (Petrus Riga, Martin of Opava), but <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> are important sources for local ecclesiastical history.|$|R

5|$|Norwich Market (also {{known as}} Norwich Provision Market) is an outdoor market {{consisting}} of around 200stalls in central Norwich, England.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{published}} numerous compilations of songs, {{including two}} six-volume textbook series, which were widely {{used throughout the}} United States. Most of her writings were focused on children's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the limited range and short attention span of children. Many of her compositions were still being used in music education programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} charter {{was passed}} by the state legislature on February13, 1832. The city's growth during the 19thcentury is indicated by the increase in its population; in 1845 the United States Census ranked Utica as the 29th-largest in the country (with 20,000 residents), more than the populations of Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland, respectively. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the century, Chicago became a boomtown based on resource extraction and processing from the Midwest, and as a railroad center.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, planar chiral {{metamaterials}} (PCMs) {{with single}} or multiple layers {{will be considered}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts.</b> Since PCMs are not bi-isotropic chiral media, one should be careful when describing their chiral responses. For example, circular polarisation states are no longer eigenstates of PCMs even though they exhibit optical activity and circular dichroism. Theoretical anlaysis on PCMs {{can be found in}} Ref.
