40|$|Image-to-physical {{registration}} {{based on}} volumetric data like computed tomography {{on the one}} side and intraoperative endoscopic images on the other side is an important method for various surgical applications. In this contribution, we present methods to generate panoramic views from endoscopic recordings for image-to-physical registration of narrow drill holes inside spongy bone. One core application is the registration of drill poses inside the mastoid during minimally invasive cochlear implantations. Besides the development of image processing software for registration, investigations are performed on a miniaturized optical system, achieving 360 ° radial imaging with one shot by extending a conventional, small, rigid, rod lens endoscope. A reflective cone geometry is used to deflect radially incoming light rays into the endoscope optics. Therefore, a cone mirror is mounted in front of a conventional 0 ° endoscope. Furthermore, panoramic images of <b>inner</b> <b>drill</b> hole surfaces in artificial bone material are created. Prior to drilling, cone beam computed tomography data is acquired from this artificial bone and simulated endoscopic views are generated from this data. A qualitative and quantitative image comparison of resulting views in terms of image-to-image registration is performed. First results show that downsizing of panoramic optics to a diameter of 3 mm is possible. Conventional rigid rod lens endoscopes can be extended to produce suitable panoramic one-shot image data. Using unrolling and stitching methods, images of the <b>inner</b> <b>drill</b> hole surface similar to computed tomography image data of the same surface were created. Registration is performed on ten perturbations of the search space and results in target registration errors of (0 : 487 ± 0 : 438) mm at the entry point and (0 : 957 ± 0 : 948) mm at the exit as well as an angular error of (1 : 763 ± 1 : 536) °. The results show suitability of this image data for image-to-image registration. Analysis of the error components in different directions reveals a strong influence of the pattern structure, meaning higher diversity results into smaller errors. © 2017 SPIE...|$|R
5000|$|By 1911, some 90,000 men {{and boys}} had {{registered}} for military training Australia-wide, a number which expanded to over 130,000 two years later. Facilities for training in Brisbane included drill halls in Alice and Adelaide Street Streets in the city, and in Boundary Street in Spring Hill. The increase in numbers placed pressure on these facilities, none of which had room for expansion as each was located in a built-up area. The Department of Defence decided it would solve the problem by swapping the three <b>inner</b> Brisbane <b>drill</b> hall sites with the Queensland Government for more adequate land, specifying that the site be close to a tram line. The Survey Officer of Engineers, Captain Good, identified three possible sites to replace the <b>inner</b> city <b>drill</b> halls. The Grammar School Endowment was favoured in assessments of the sites, and in November 1910 the trustees of the endowment accepted an offer of £8000, and the deed of title for the [...] "Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve" [...] {{was transferred to the}} Commonwealth in May 1911.|$|R

The flow-loop and the layout of the flow-loop are shown in Figs.  3 and 4, respectively. The flow-loop as shown in Fig.  3 was designed with a concentric annular test section of 16 ft (4.9  m) long acrylic pipe, with 3.5 -in. (0.089  m) ID that acted as a simulated wellbore/casing. The static <b>inner</b> <b>drilled</b> PVC pipe was built with 2.4 in. (0.609  m) and sealed at both ends. The annulus test section was adjusted for five different hole-angles (0 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °) as shown in Fig.  5 a–e during the experiments. The mud was circulated using a 2 -hp variable speed centrifugal pump with the capacity of about 20 – 42  L/min (181.2 – 380.52 bbl/day). In order to trap the cuttings, separation tank was mounted after the annulus section, and was fitted with wire mesh of 0.2  mm. The wire mesh was much smaller than the cuttings size in order to achieve efficient separation. The transported cuttings were collected after 7  min of circulation process and 5 min of recirculation to clean up any cuttings residue inside the flow pipes before a new run can be made.

40|$|AbstractHole {{accidents}} during {{drilling and}} borehole collapse during extracting are bottlenecks restricting gas drainage efficiency in soft outburst-prone coal seams in China. The auger-air combined drilling technique and sieve tube mounting method are an alternative solution to these technology bottlenecks. The auger-air drilling technique combines {{the advantages of}} “dry style” auger drilling and air drilling. Specially designed blade in drill rod can stir up large particles of coal so that large particles {{can be brought to}} ground smoothly using compressed air and is efficient to prevent borehole accidents. After drilling is completed, the sieve tube is tripped in through the <b>inner</b> hole of <b>drilling</b> pipes, and then lifting up drilling pipes, the tube sieve will provide a complete tunnel for gas extraction. Field application proves that with proper drilling parameter selection and appropriate tube install control, it is more promising to double drilling depth and raise gas drainage efficiency...|$|R
40|$|National audienceResearch has {{demonstrated}} that the implementation of hearing protectors to prevent noise-induced hearing loss merits from individual verification at the workfloor. Therefore, the MIRE (Microphone In Real Ear) technique has been adapted for custom-made earplugs with an <b>inner</b> bore <b>drilled</b> over the plug's total length. So a microphone can be inserted to measure via this test bore the sound pressure level behind the hearing protector. The measurement setup appears to be practically feasible, but a clear discrepancy is expected between the sound pressure level at the microphone {{and the level of}} interest at the eardrum. To gain insight into this difference - henceforth called transfer function - research has first been conducted with a HATS (Head And Torso Simulator) equipped with the custom-made earplugs. More concrete, the transfer function between the sound pressure at the HATS "eardrum" and the MIRE microphone has been measured and numerically simulated with the FDTD approach (Finite-Difference Time-Domain). The transfer functions appear to be stable and reproducible, moreover their most distinct characteristics can be traced down to the main acoustical features of earplug and ear canal. Further the influence of an individual's specific geometry of the earplug - ear canal complex on the transfer functions has been addressed by performing measurement and simulations with human subjects similar to the research conducted with the HATS. The concordance between individualized simulations and measurements is very satisfying, but the computational cost of the FDTD technique is too large to be implemented in measurement equipment used to test hearing protectors at the workfloor. Therefore a filter approach has been developed based on the FDTD model. The filter transfer functions show good resemblance with the original measurements and simulations if the length of the test bore and of the residual part of the ear canal are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{published}} by Elsevier as Open Access under a CC BY 4. 0 licence. Bone drilling {{is one of the}} most common operations used to repair fractured parts of bones. During a bone drilling process, microcracks are generated on the inner surface of the drilled holes that can detrimentally affect osteosynthesis and healing. This study focuses on the investigation of microcracks and pullout strength of cortical-bone screws in drilled holes. It compares conventional surgical bone drilling (CSBD) with rotary ultrasonic bone drilling (RUBD), a novel approach employing ultrasonic vibration with a diamond-coated hollow tool. Both techniques were used to drill holes in porcine bones in an in-vitro study. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe microcracks and surface morphology. The results obtained showed a significant decrease in the number and dimensions of microcracks generated on the <b>inner</b> surface of <b>drilled</b> holes with the RUBD process in comparison to CSBD. It was also observed that a higher rotational speed and a lower feed rate resulted in lower damage, i. e. fewer microcracks. Biomechanical axial pullout strength of a cortical bone screw inserted into a hole drilled with RUBD was found to be much higher (55 – 385 %) than that for CSBD...|$|R
40|$|This novel core break-off and {{retention}} mechanism {{consists of a}} scoring dawg controlled {{by a set of}} two tubes (a drill tube and an <b>inner</b> tube). The <b>drill</b> tube and the inner tube have longitudinal concentric holes. The solution can be implemented in an eccentric tube configuration as well where the tubes have eccentric longitudinal holes. The inner tube presents at the bottom two control surfaces for controlling the orientation of the scoring dawg. The drill tube presents a sunk-in profile {{on the inside of the}} wall for housing the scoring dawg. The inner tube rotation relative to the drill tube actively controls the orientation of the scoring dawg and hence its penetration and retrieval from the core. The scoring dawg presents a shaft, two axially spaced arms, and a tooth. The two arms slide on the control surfaces of the inner tube. The tooth, when rotated, can penetrate or be extracted from the core. During drilling, the two tubes move together maintaining the scoring dawg completely outside the core. After the desired drilling depth has been reached the inner tube is rotated relative to the drill tube such that the tooth of the scoring dawg moves toward the central axis. By rotating the drill tube, the scoring dawg can score the core and so reduce its cross sectional area. The scoring dawg can also act as a stress concentrator for breaking the core in torsion or tension. After breaking the core, the scoring dawg can act as a core retention mechanism. For scoring, it requires the core to be attached to the rock. If the core is broken, the dawg can be used as a retention mechanism. The scoring dawg requires a hard-tip insert like tungsten carbide for scoring hard rocks. The relative rotation of the two tubes can be controlled manually or by an additional actuator. In the implemented design solution the bit rotation for scoring was in the same direction as the drilling. The device was tested for limestone cores and basalt cores. The torque required for breaking the 10 -mm diameter limestone cores was 5 to 5. 8 lb-in. (0. 56 to 0. 66 N-m) ...|$|R
40|$|Sampling cores {{requires}} the controlled breakoff {{of the core}} at a known location {{with respect to the}} drill end. An additional problem is designing a mechanism that can be implemented at a small scale that is robust and versatile enough to be used for a variety of core samples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill tube and an inner tube) and a rolling element (rolling tooth). An additional tube {{can be used as a}} sample tube. The drill tube and the inner tube have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each tube. The two eccentricities are equal. The inner tube fits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside the <b>inner</b> tube. While <b>drilling,</b> the two tubes are positioned relative to each other such that the sample tube is aligned with the drill tube axis and core. The drill tube includes teeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The inner tube includes, at the base, the rolling element implemented as a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot. An additional slot in the inner tube and a pin in the drill tube limit the relative motion of the two tubes. While drilling, the drill assembly rotates relative to the core and forces the rolling tooth to stay hidden in the slot along the inner tube wall. When the drilling depth has been reached, the drill bit assembly is rotated in the opposite direction, and the rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core. Depending on the strength of the created core, the rolling tooth can score, lock the inner tube relative to the core, start the eccentric motion of the inner tube, and break the core. The tooth and the relative position of the two tubes can act as a core catcher or core-retention mechanism as well. The design was made to fit the core and hole parameters produced by an existing bit; the parts were fabricated and a series of demonstration tests were performed. This invention is potentially applicable to sample return and in situ missions to planets such as Mars and Venus, to moons such as Titan and Europa, and to comets. It is also applicable to terrestrial applications like forensic sampling and geological sampling in the field...|$|R
40|$|With {{the notion}} of {{evolving}} current Extended Reach Drilling, this master thesis examines if drilling 20 – 40 km is feasible. Several reservoirs offshore in the area outside of Lofoten {{in the northern part}} of Norway are reachable by 20 – 40 km in horizontal displacement. The term for these excessive lengths is Ultra Extended Reach Drilling (UL–ERD) and is the foundation for this master thesis. To solve this task a "‘Well Path and Drilling Software"’ (WP&D software) is developed to simulate the drilling operation with regard to well path, drilling, running of casing/liner and well service using wire line. Three–dimensional well path design, analysis of loads and stresses experienced, torque and drag calculation and hydraulic calculation used in the software are presented in this master thesis. Attaining UL-ERD demands innovation in all areas of drilling technology. This thesis addresses this by simulating different scenarios in the software, presenting and discussing the results. The well path designed needs least possible dog–legs and azimuthal change to avoid increased frictional forces and contribution from the capstan effect. Drilling with different drill pipe materials like steel, titanium and composite shows the advantage of using lighter materials to reduce torque and drag. The hydraulic requirements to pump down the string is overcome by having 700 bars of working pressure available on mud pumps and the use of large <b>inner</b> diameter of <b>drill</b> pipe. High Equivalent Circulating Densities (ECD) are handled by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and its Applied Back Pressure (ABP). The flow rate used to maintain a constant annular velocity is valid if hole cleaning is fulfilled throughout the well. Larger inner diameter requires larger outer diameter which leads to excessive ECDs in small holes. Large diameter drilled holes with corresponding casing/linerOD sizes in parenthesis; 36 "(30 "), 26 "(20 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 " and 12 1 / 4 "(95 / 8 "). Expandable casing is used to have two lengths of 13 3 / 8 " liner intervals giving the ability of using large inner and outer diameter drill pipe. Setting of casing/liner is performed conventionally using casing/liner filled with mud and unconventionally with fully evacuated casing/liner with nitrogen or casing/liner with mud over nitrogen. The snubbing unit is assumed dimensioned to handle 100 tonnes to get casing/liner down. Rotation of the liner is possible when the absolute density is close to the mud weight in the hole, giving a reduced buoyant weight. Different simulation of inner and outer diameter dimension of drill pipe concludes that an 8 "outer diameter and 7 " inner diameter is the best option for UL-ERD in this thesis. This, incombination of a lighter material such as composite, leads to 40882 meters Measured Depth(MD) at 2506 meters True Vertical Depth (TVD), Horizontal Displacement (HD) of 39501 meters and a Step–Out–ratio of 15, 7. It also has a slight azimuthal change in the well path. The mud pumps deliver 700 bars and the proper flow rate to clean the wellbore using MPD. The casing/liner reaches setting depth and it is possible to run composite wire line with welltractor to perform well service, through the production tubing. Torque and drag calculationsare valid for the specified Make-Up Torque (MUT) of approximately 85 kN. The max limit of 100 kN MUT can be handled by using a tapered drill string. 5 7 / 8 " drill pipe with either steel, titanium or composite can be used to drill multiple wells and join them together to achieve one UL–ERD well. Steel drill pipe is be most preferable with regard to availability and cost. Larger tubular with light drill string material is beneficial when it comes to reducing torque and drag and hydraulic issues in these shorter wells. Obtaining UL–ERD wells in this way requires less modification with regard to the drilling process, since lengths drilled are shorter. The disadvantage is that in a somewhat pristine area as Lofoten, the Health Safety Environment (HSE) issues with drilling offshore is a valid obstacle for not choosing this solution here. This thesis recommends that when having solved the issues with torque and drag, hydraulicrequirement and available equipment, reaching UL–ERD can be performed by drilling fromone location on land, or with multiple wells from several locations on and off land joined into one well. An 8 " composite drill pipe with 7 " inner diameter could be used, lightening the casing/liner to get to setting depth and use composite wire line to perform well service. Recommendations are made on the basis of mud pumps delivering sufficient pump pressure,stronger snubbing units, use of expandable casing, torque and drag is being handled, large hole diameters, larger inner and outer diameters of tubular, the use of a tapered drill string,development and innovation of equipment found vital for the task. </p...|$|R
