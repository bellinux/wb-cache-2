5|$|His reign was <b>inextricably</b> {{connected}} to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman domination. Although there exist no historical sources which prove that he took {{active role in the}} defence of the country, in Bulgarian folklore Ivan Shishman is portrayed as a legendary and heroic ruler who desperately fought against the overwhelming Ottoman forces. There are numerous sites, geographical features and fortresses named after him throughout Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, <b>inextricably</b> {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius {{appeared}} through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was <b>inextricably</b> associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so <b>inextricably</b> linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most {{detailed}} narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost <b>inextricably.</b> Much earlier and shorter is the story told by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E
5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also <b>inextricably</b> entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} battle, he married the {{daughter}} of a prominent Athenian, and his activities were thereafter <b>inextricably</b> linked with that city until his death. After Athens was captured by Ibrahim Pasha in June 1826, Makriyannis helped organise the defence of the Acropolis, and became the provisional commander of the garrison after the death of the commander, Yannis Gouras. He managed to repel a fierce assault against the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on 7 October, and during the defence of the Acropolis, he sustained heavy injures three times, to the head and to the neck. These wounds troubled him for the remainder of his life, but they did not dissuade him from taking part in the last phase of the war: in the spring of 1827 he took part in the battles of Piraeus and the battle of Analatos.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver 2 {{is set in}} Nosgoth, {{a fictional}} land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are <b>inextricably</b> tied {{to the health of}} the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a {{manipulative}} sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E
5|$|The mid-fifteenth century {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the private feuds of the nobility, and the Wars of the Roses in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud. This was between Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, whose family had been earls of that county since 1335 and William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville. Their feud became <b>inextricably</b> tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, historian Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.|$|E
5|$|This garment {{instantly}} received significant global media coverage, and {{has been}} cited along with Elizabeth Hurley's black Versace dress {{as one of the}} most high-profile dresses that made the designer Versace a household name. In addition, this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace. It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath's Dress of the Year collection, at which point it was described as a key example of the close relationship between fashions, celebrities and publicity. Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015, Lopez still owns the original gown. In 2015, fifteen years since Lopez first wore it, the dress is still <b>inextricably</b> associated with her and Versace.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become <b>inextricably</b> linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success <b>inextricably</b> linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese {{believed}} that three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were <b>inextricably</b> linked {{and subject to}} natural cycles; if man could understand these cycles, they could understand the hidden secrets of the three realms. One cycle was yin and yang, which corresponded to yielding and hard, shade and sunlight, feminine and masculine, and the Moon and Sun, respectively, while it was thought to govern the three realms and changing of seasons. The five phases was another important cycle where the elements of wood (mu 木), fire (huo 火), earth (tu 土), metal (jin 金), and water (shui 水) succeeded each other in rotation and each corresponded with certain traits of the three realms. For example, the five phases corresponded with other sets of five like the five organs (i.e. liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys) and five tastes (i.e. sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty), or even things like feelings, musical notes, colors, planets, calendars and time periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, {{his view of the}} Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so <b>inextricably</b> to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E
5|$|The record {{football}} {{attendance at}} the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit {{would have been able}} to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home. This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now <b>inextricably</b> associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are <b>inextricably</b> linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was <b>inextricably</b> connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' conceptions of the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is <b>inextricably</b> connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E

25|$|Drug cultivation, {{production}} and trafficking has been <b>inextricably</b> {{linked to the}} Colombian armed conflict for decades, having served as {{the main source of}} financing for most illegal armed groups (including the FARC) while playing {{a central role in the}} Colombian and foreign governments' responses to the internal conflict.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the motor}} car was also <b>inextricably</b> {{linked to the}} economy, with 2,305,000 people working in the motor trade, or 10 percent of the labour force.

25|$|Invariant {{theory of}} {{infinite}} groups is <b>inextricably</b> {{linked with the}} development of linear algebra, especially, the theories of quadratic forms and determinants. Another subject with strong mutual influence is projective geometry, where invariant theory can be used to organize the subject, and during the 1960s, new life was breathed into the subject by David Mumford in the form of his geometric invariant theory.|$|E
25|$|Horse {{racing is}} a popular equestrian sport which is practiced in many nations around the world. It is <b>inextricably</b> {{associated}} with gambling, where in certain events, stakes can become very high.

25|$|The {{development}} {{of music in}} the Royal Marines is <b>inextricably</b> linked with the evolution of British military bands.

As long ago as the days of Drake and Hawkins the drummer's rhythm would advertise the changing watches or beat the men to quarters.|$|E

25|$|The Russian avant-garde was a large, {{influential}} wave {{of modernist}} art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930.

Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, and Marc Chagall. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism.|$|E
