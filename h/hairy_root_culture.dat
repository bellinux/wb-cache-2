40|$|Plant hairy roots {{have been}} widely used in the {{production}} of secondary metabolites because of its stabilization of genetics, fast growth rate and high content of secondary metabolites. In order to enhance the secondary metabolite accumulation, a lot of metabolic regulation methods have been applied in the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>culture.</b> Hairy roots cultured in liquid medium easily formed dense clumps which impaired the liquid mixing and dissolved oxygen mass transfer. As a result, the growth and secondary metabolism of hairy roots were limited. In this study, ultrasound was employed in Echinacea purpurea <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>culture</b> to trigger off the defence strategy and to reduce the oxygen limitation for enhancing the root growth and cichoric acid production. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method was employed to simulate the hydrodynamics and mass transfer within the hairy root clumps in a bioreactor, and it also was used to illustrate the ultrasound intensive effect on the oxygen mass transfer for improving hairy root growth and cichoric acid production. An efficient ultrasound-stimulation strategy was developed for improving the hairy root growth and cichoric acid biosynthesis in the hairy root cultures of E. purpurea. The mechanism of ultrasound effect on hairy root growth and metabolism was further discussed. Proper ultrasound strategy stimulated rolB expression, which further increased the endogenous IAA content for one time, and finally shortened the growth cycle for 5 days. The oxidative burst, characterized by rapid and transient production of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, was triggered by ultrasound. This stimulated the activity of antioxidative enzymes and the metabolism of antioxidative compounds such as flavoniods and phenolic compounds. The marked increase of cichoric acid production in E. purpurea hairy roots was related to the increases of phenylalanine ammonium lyase (PAL) activity stimulated by ultrasound. Multiple ultrasound stimulation with intervals of 5 days produced the highest amount of cichoric acid because of the high PAL activity in the whole culture process. Ultrasound was applied to intensify the bioreactor culture process. Compared with that in the control, hairy root biomass and cichoric acid content increased after multiple ultrasound treatment for 6 min each 5 days. A two-dimensional axisymmetric CFD model based on a porous media model and a discrete population balance model was established to investigate the hydrodynamics and mass transfer behavior in an airlift bioreactor for <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>culture.</b> During <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>culture</b> process of E. purpurea, liquid and gas velocity, gas holdup, mass transfer rate, as well as oxygen concentration distribution in the bioreactor were simulated by this CFD model.

MS medium supplemented with a 20 : 20 ratio (mM) of NH 4 + to NO 3 - displayed highest growth rates and biomass yield in <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>cultures.</b> The present study demonstrated that the composition of culture medium and the ratio of different nitrogen sources have significant impact on the growth of V. officinalis <b>hairy</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} plants can be {{successfully}} transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes through the transfer of T-DNA from agrobacteria to the plant genome. Transgenic tissue – <b>hairy</b> <b>roots</b> – is produced {{as a result of}} the transformation process. This organized, genetically stable, hormone-independent transformed tissue is capable of accomplishing complex metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis and accumulation of various secondary metabolites. Somaclonal variation is often observed among the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>cultures.</b> The highlyproductive <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> lines, containing a large amount of important metabolites can be selected and grown in vitro on hormone-free media for a long period of time, whilst preserving their biosynthetic capacities. Consequently, during the last decade, <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> have been recognized as an excellent system for in vitro generation of a large biomass of transgenic tissue that could be utilized for the extraction of desired metabolites or even in the development of new compounds through novel metabolic pathways. Species from the family Rhamnaceae are well known for their capacity to synthesize the aromatic carbohydrates, anthraquinones (AQs). These metabolites with laxative action are traditionally extracted from the bark of Frangulae cortex. Applying a genetic engineering approach, the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> of Rhamnus fallax open a convenient alternative for the production of increased amount of medically important metabolites such as AQs while protecting natural recourses and environmen...|$|R
