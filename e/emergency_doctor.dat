25|$|As the settlement's main <b>emergency</b> <b>doctor,</b> Goldstein was {{involved}} in treating victims of Arab-Israeli violence prior to that incident as well. He expressed anti-Arab feelings far before the massacre. Israeli press reports stated that Goldstein refused to treat Arabs, even those serving in the IDF; this was also reflected in comments by his acquaintances. He was known to refuse to treat Druze soldiers {{who served in the}} West Bank, claiming that it was against Jewish laws to treat non-Jews. However, these anonymous claims were refuted by a number of sources, including Dr. Manfred Lehman and Dr. Chaim Simons, quoting the Shamgar Commission report.|$|E

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF – Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen – ambulances staffed {{with a doctor}} in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen – regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW – Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross in order to organise transportation of non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs (Labor-Samaritan-Alliance), the Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria (the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps) and the Grünes Kreuz (Green Cross) operate various non-emergency ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transportation. In addition to the land-ambulances there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, which is also staffed with an <b>emergency</b> <b>doctor</b> in addition to regular personnel.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Baruch Goldstein, who {{was born}} and lived in Brooklyn, New York, was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League. After emigrating to Israel in 1983, {{he served as a}} {{physician}} in the Israeli Defense Force, first as a conscript, then in the reserve forces. Following the end of his active duty, Goldstein worked as a physician and lived in the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron, where he served as an <b>emergency</b> <b>doctor.</b> Goldstein became involved with Kach, and maintained a strong personal relationship with Kahane, whose views, regarded by the Israeli government as racist, had caused his party to be banned from the Knesset in 1988. Kahane was assassinated in 1990 by Arab terrorist El Sayyid Nosair in New York City, and Goldstein reportedly swore to take revenge for the killing. Goldstein was elected to Kiryat Arba city council and in this capacity assisted in establishing a memorial park dedicated to Kahane.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} study {{was carried out}} to analyse all X-rays requested from the three accident and emergency departments in Sheffield during one week. There were 3253 patients examined, of which 1028 (31 - 6 %) were X-rayed, 1251 sets of X-rays being performed. Few X-rays (4 5 %) were requested for medico-legal reasons. Skull X-rays were studied in particular detail. Only 5 (4 - 5 %) of 112 films were subsequently reported as abnormal by the radiologist. The accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>doctor's</b> ability to predict X-ray outcome was not very good, their false positive rate being high at 21 % while their false negative rate was low at 5 * 5 %. This indicates that the accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>doctors</b> tended to be over cautious to compensate for their lack of experience...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency and elicitors of severe anaphylactic reactions that led to emergency doctors’ service in Berlin and the medical care according to the current guideline. From November 2007 to December 2009 240 cases of allergic reactions were reported by the <b>emergency</b> <b>doctors</b> of Berlin, Germany who completed a specific questionnaire. 220 of these cases included respiratory and/or cardiovascular symptoms and were further analysed. The reported anaphylactic reactions were classified according to Ring and Messmer in four grades of severity, six reactions were classified as grade II, 203 reactions as grade III and 11 reactions were grade IV reactions. Of the 220 registered patients, only 14 were {{children and young adults}} below 18 years of age. In total, 58. 2 % of the cases concerned women at an average age of 53. 9 years (SD 18. 4). The most common elicitors were food (30. 9 %), drugs (25. 0 %) and venom (22. 7 %). In 2008 0. 3 % of the emergency calls were due to an anaphylactic reaction. Most of them were reported in July, with 6 reactions per 1000 emergency calls. For the population of Berlin a prevalence of anaphylactic reactions requiring visits of <b>emergency</b> <b>doctors</b> of 4. 4 per 100 000 and an incidence of 2. 5 per 100 000 inhabitants were determined. Differences in the distribution pattern within Berlin could not unambigouously be referred to the socioeconomic status, measured by the unemployment rate.
