5|$|Welsh cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking traditions and practices {{associated with the}} country of Wales and the Welsh people. While there are {{a large number of}} dishes that can be considered Welsh due to their ingredients and/or history, dishes such as cawl, Welsh rarebit, laverbread, Welsh cakes, bara brith and the Glamorgan sausage have all been regarded as symbols of Welsh food. Some variation in dishes exists across the country, with notable differences existing in the Gower Peninsula; an historically <b>isolated</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> which developed self-sufficiency in food production.

40|$|The {{problem of}} more {{efficient}} organization {{of health care}} delivery systems in <b>isolated</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> {{has always been a}} crucial one, and worthy of concentrated effort to solve. A potential solution to many aspects of that problem lies in the form of recent developments in microprocessor technology. The projected benefits from this innovation are substantial, and it should be clear that the implementation of small computer systems continues to hold dramatic implications to the health care delivery of <b>isolated</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The use of small computer systems by the Indian Health Service, Latter Day Saints Hospital, and other organizations in various configurations in remote <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> provide ample evidence of the potential of such systems. A study by the Institute for Rural-Suburban Research and Planning has explored the implications of this innovation in full detail...|$|R
