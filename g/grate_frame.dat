50|$|This paradox was {{originally}} proposed and solved by Wolfgang Rindler and involved a fast walking man, {{represented by a}} rod, falling into a grate. It is assumed that the rod is entirely over the grate in the <b>grate</b> <b>frame</b> of reference before the downward acceleration begins simultaneously and equally applied to each point in the rod.|$|E
5000|$|And after drying, {{removing}} the wooden form, cleaning the pipe inverts and placing the <b>grates</b> in the <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} {{acceleration of the}} rod, which is simultaneous in the <b>grate's</b> <b>frame</b> of reference, is not simultaneous in the rod's frame of reference. In the rod's frame of reference, {{the bottom of the}} front of the rod is first accelerated downward (not shown in drawing), and as time goes by, {{more and more of the}} rod is subjected to {{the downward}} acceleration, until finally the back of the rod is accelerated downward. This results in a bending of the rod in the rod's frame of reference. It should be stressed that, since this bending occurs in the rod's rest frame, it is a true physical distortion of the rod which will cause stresses to occur in the rod.|$|R
50|$|Millholland's inventions and {{contributions}} include the cast-iron crank axle, wooden spring, plate girder bridge, poppet throttle, anthracite firebox, water <b>grate,</b> drop <b>frame,</b> and steel tires. He {{was also an}} early user and advocate of the superheater, the feedwater heater, and the injector. Several of his innovations were adopted as standard practice by the railroad industry.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a stress-strain analysis of chosen climbing rung. The thesis is divided into four main parts. The {{first part of the}} thesis reviews three-dimensional <b>frames</b> (<b>grates)</b> and their possible solution. The second part includes analytical solution of chosen, idealized climbing rung by using CastiglianoÂ´s theorem. The third part includes numerical solution by using finite element method performed in ANSYS software. Finally, the last part summarizes results which are also thoroughly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accessories}} are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, fireguards, log boxes, andirons, pellet baskets, and fire dogs, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire <b>grate)</b> is a <b>frame,</b> usually of iron bars, to retain fuel for a fire. Heavy metal firebacks are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect {{the back of the}} fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set {{in front of the fireplace}} to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more.|$|R
