25|$|Example 5. Periodic {{sequence}}. A {{sequence is}} called periodic when there exists some number n > 0, called {{a witness to}} periodicity, such that x'i= x'i+n for all i ≥ 0. The period of a periodic sequence is its least witness. Negation leaves period unchanged, while the disjunction of two periodic sequences is periodic, with period at most the least common multiple of the periods of the two arguments (the period can be as small as 1, as <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> union of any sequence and its complement). Hence the periodic sequences form a Boolean algebra.|$|E

25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is similar to}} what <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior {{have been found in}} hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E

2500|$|In Islam the {{theological}} {{issue is not}} usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's jabr, or divine commanding power. al-Ash'ari developed an [...] "acquisition" [...] or [...] "dual-agency" [...] form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine jabr were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant Ash'ari position. In Shia Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward predestination is challenged by most theologians. Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the Day of Judgement because they are their own; however, the free will <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> permission of God.|$|E
2500|$|As we {{have seen}} so far, Moreton pays close {{attention}} to the most practical points of his project, as it also <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inadequacy of the street lighting system in London; after all his aim is to render the city [...] "strongly guarded, and so gloriously illuminated". Moreton proposes that: a convenient number of lamps be set up, and those not of the convex kind, which blind the eyes, and are of no manner of use; they dazzle, but give no distinct light, and further, rather than prevent robberies. Many persons, deceived and blinded by these ignes fatui, have been run over by coaches, carts, , people stumbling more, even under these very lamps, than in the dark. In short, they are most unprofitable lights, and, in my opinion, rather abuses than benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Certain metals can be {{recovered}} from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire: notably tin, lead and (at a higher temperature) copper, {{a process known}} as smelting. The first evidence of this extractive metallurgy dates from the 5th and 6th millenniumBC, and was found in the archaeological sites of Majdanpek, Yarmovac and Plocnik, all three in Serbia. To date, the earliest copper smelting is found at the Belovode site, these examples include a copper axe from 5500 BC belonging to the Vinča culture. Other signs of early metals are found from the third millenniumBC in places like Palmela (Portugal), Los Millares (Spain), and Stonehenge (United Kingdom). However, as often <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> study of prehistoric times, the ultimate beginnings cannot be clearly defined and new discoveries are ongoing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the town}} centre, {{the car is}} the [...] most popular mode of {{transport}} in Aix-les-Bains, despite the efforts made by the Association Roue Libre {{for the development of}} urban cycling. Traffic at peak hours is particularly difficult, especially in the summer with the influx of tourists. The portion of the D1201 road along the lake, in the direction of Chambéry, is particularly sensitive to this increase in road traffic. The same problem <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rue de Genève, the Boulevard President Wilson and the Rue de Chambéry. To the north, it is similarly so {{on the way out of}} the town in the direction of Albens and Annecy on the Boulevard Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny. However, traffic has tended to improve with urban development promoting the emergence of roundabouts at the expense of the traffic light, allowing a better flow of traffic. In addition, in the town centre, two car parks can accommodate vehicles, although the number of parking spaces remains low in the town centre for shopping.|$|E
2500|$|Within the Theravada-tradition, three {{different}} stances on nirvana {{and the question}} what <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Arhat after death can be found.
