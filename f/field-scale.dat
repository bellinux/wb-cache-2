An unconventional scaling hypothesis for the free energy is given, modeling this separated scaling in accordance with detailed numerical self-consistent solutions for up to 200 orders of RSB. A divergent correlation-length describes the RSB-criticality as a long-range correlation effect occurring on the pseudo-lattice of RSB-orders.

A formal program of experimental research was begun to directly test upscaling theories in fluid flow through porous media by comparing measurements of relative permeability and capillary-saturation with measurements of interfacial area per volume. This project on the experimental investigation of relative permeability upscaling has produced a unique combination of three quite different technical approaches to the upscaling problem of obtaining pore-related microscopic properties and using them to predict macroscopic behavior. Several important ''firsts'' have been achieved {{during the course of the}} project. (1) Optical coherence imaging, a laser-based ranging and imaging technique, has produced the first images of grain and pore structure up to 1 mm beneath the surface of the sandstone and in a laboratory borehole. (2) Woods metal injection has connected for the first time microscopic pore-scale geometric measurements with macroscopic saturation in real sandstone cores. (3) The micro-model technique has produced the first invertible relationship between saturation and capillary pressure [...] showing that interfacial area per volume (IAV) provides the linking parameter.

At the time, the best available remediation technology was pump and treat technology. PRBs presented a more cost-effective solution to the problem at hand, being able to passively remediate the groundwater. Granular metal was chosen as the reactive media after laboratory testing using contaminated water from the site. After installation contaminants were reduced to target levels. As a result, the pump and treat machinery was able to be removed and the above ground was free to be used for commercial purposes. The savings from using the PRB as opposed to pump and treat were able to pay for the installation in about three years.|$|E
50|$|Another {{concern with}} land farming {{is that while}} lower molecularweight {{petroleum}} compounds biodegrade efficiently, higher molecular weight compounds biodegrade more slowly. This means that repeated applications can lead to accumulation of high molecular weight compounds. At high concentrations, these recalcitrant constituents can increase soil-water repellency, affect plant growth, reduce {{the ability of the}} soil to support a diverse community of organisms, and render the land farm no longer usable without treatment or amendment. Recent studies have supported the idea that <b>field-scale</b> additions of earthworms with selected organic amendments may hasten the long-term recovery of conventionally treated petroleum contaminated soil. The burrowing and feeding activities of earthworms create space and allow food resources to become available to other soil organisms that would be unable to survive otherwise.

40|$|Subsurface drained {{experimental}} {{fields are}} frequently used for studying preferential flow (PF) in structured soils. Considering two-dimensional (2 -D) transport towards the drain, however, {{the relevance of}} mass transfer coefficients, apparently reflecting small-scale soil structural properties, for the water and solute balances of the entire drained field is largely unknown. This paper reviews and analyzes effects of mass transfer reductions on Br&minus; leaching for a subsurface drained experimental field using a numerical 2 -D dual-permeability model (2 D-DPERM). The sensitivity of the "diffusive" mass transfer component on bromide (Br&minus;) leaching patterns is discussed. Flow and transport is simulated in a 2 -D vertical cross-section using parameters, boundary conditions (BC), and data of a Br&minus; tracer irrigation experiment on a subsurface drained field (5000 m 2 area) at Bokhorst (Germany), where soils have developed from glacial till sediments. The 2 D-DPERM simulation scenarios assume realistic irrigation and rainfall rates, and Br-application in the soil matrix (SM) domain. The mass transfer reduction controls preferential tracer movement and {{can be related to}} physical and chemical properties at the interface between flow path and soil matrix in structured soil. A reduced solute mass transfer rate coefficient allows a better match of the Br&minus; mass flow observed in the tile drain discharge. The results suggest that coefficients of water and solute transfer between PF and SM domains have a clear impact on Br&minus; effluent from the drain. Amount and composition of the drain effluent is analyzed as a highly complex interrelation between temporally and spatially variable mass transfer in the 2 -D vertical flow domain that depends on varying "advective" and "diffusive" transfer components, the spatial distribution of residual tracer concentrations, and the lateral flow fields in both domains from plots of the whole subsurface drained field. The local-scale soil structural effects (e. g., such as macropore wall coatings), here conceptualized as changes in mass transfer coefficients, can have a clear effect on leaching at the plot and <b>field-scales...</b>|$|R
40|$|When an {{isolated}} piece of conductor is sufficiently small, {{the energy to}} add another electron can be larger than the available thermal energy, {{and the number of}} electrons on the island is well-defined. If the island is made still smaller, the quantum confinement energy also becomes large, the electronic states on the dot become discrete, and the island is called a quantum dot, or sometimes an artificial atom. Quantum dots have been a focus of active research for the past decade, both as model systems for exploring physics, and as the ultimate limit in size reduction for conventional transistors. Early quantum dots were made only by lithographic patterning, but more recently the solution-based synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals, which are much smaller than the lithographic quantum dots, has been developed. The nanocrystals can range in size from 1. 5 nm to 8 nm in diameter with a narrow size distribution, and they can form close-packed arrays when deposited from solution, with organic molecules that coat the nanocrystals serving as spacers. These quantum dot arrays have the potential to be model artificial solids, with tunable intersite coupling, site energies, and order. I present results for electronic transport measurements on large arrays of CdSe nanocrystals. In response to a step in the applied voltage, we observe a power-law decay of the current over five orders of magnitude in time and four orders of magnitude in current. Furthermore, we do not observe a steady-state dark current for fields up to 1 x 106 V/cm and times out to 5 x 104 seconds. (cont.) Despite evidence that the charge injected into the film during the measurement causes the decay of current, we find <b>field-scaling</b> of the current at all times.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{food demand}} {{as well as}} the need to predict the impact of warming climate on vegetation makes it critical to find the best tools to assess crop production and carbon dioxide (CO₂) exchange between the land and atmosphere. Photosynthesis is a good indicator of crop production and CO₂ exchange. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) is directly related to photosynthesis. ChF can be measured at leaf-scale using active techniques and at <b>field-scales</b> using passive techniques. The measurement principles of both techniques are different. In this study, three overarching questions about ChF were addressed: Q 1) How water, nutrient and ambient light conditions determine the relationships between photosynthesis and ChF? Which is the optimum irradiance level for detecting water and nutrient deficit conditions with ChF?; Q 2) which are the limits within which active and passive techniques are comparable?; and Q 3) What is the seasonal relationship between photosynthesis and ChF when nitrogen is the limiting factor? To address these questions, two main experiments were conducted: Exp 1) Concurrent photosynthesis and ChF light-response curves were measured in camelina and wheat plants growing under (i) intermediate-light and (ii) high-light conditions respectively. Plant stress was induced by (i) withdrawing water, and (ii) applying different nitrogen levels; and Exp 2) coincident active and passive ChF measurements were made in a wheat field under different nitrogen treatments. The results indicated ChF has a direct relationship with photosynthesis when water or nitrogen drives the relationship. This study demonstrates that the light level at which plants were grown was optimum for detecting water and nutrient deficit with ChF. Also, the results showed that for leaf-average-values, active measurements can be used to better understand the daily and seasonal behavior of passive ChF. Further, the seasonal relation between photosynthesis and ChF with nitrogen stress was not a simple linear function. Our study showed that at times in the season when nitrogen was sufficient and photosynthesis was highest, ChF decreased because these two processes compete for available energy. These results demonstrated that ChF is a reliable indicator of crop stress and has great potential for better understand the CO₂ exchange between the land and atmosphere...|$|R

The readiness with which A. majus flower colour and shape mutate and can be crossbred has led to the establishments of unusual (e.g. peloric) cultivars, as well as to making this species one of the first model organisms of genetics and helping uniting the theories of Darwin and Mendel. It remains a key model organism today in fields such as plant developmental genetics. Common toadflax has become established as a model organism more recently; while it may be an invasive nuisance weed in agriculture, like other toadflaxes and snapdragons, its attractive flowers make it useful as a wildflower.

40|$|AbstractCalifornia's Central Valley grows a {{significant}} fraction of grapes used for wine {{production in the}} United States. With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, {{it is critical to}} be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 -km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, ~ 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19 – 23 % (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mmd− 1), reducing to 14 – 20 % at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (~ 5 mmwk− 1). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at <b>field-scales</b> over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies suggest}} that bedrock {{incision}} by granular flows may be the primary process cutting valleys in steep, unglaciated landscapes. The mechanisms of granular flow incision, however, are not well quantified. Here I present a suite of laboratory experiments describing processes and rates of bedrock erosion by granular flows. In the first study, experiments in a 56 cm diameter, 15 cm wide rotating drum test the hypothesis that bedrock erosion is related to grain inertial stresses which scale with shear rate and particle size. In 67 experimental runs, the eroded depth of the bedrock sample varied with inertial stresses in the granular flow to a power less than 1. 0, and inversely with the bedrock strength. The second study used a new debris flow flume facility comprised of a 4 -meter diameter, 80 -cm wide vertically rotating drum to measure mean and fluctuating normal forces {{at the base of}} granular flows. The mean bulk force scaled with the static weight of the flow, while the variance of the force was a function of grain diameter, flow velocity, and matrix fluid properties. I show that the square of the impulse, related to kinetic energy transferred to the bed from granular collisions, can be quantified as the variance of the force signal. My results provide the first quantitative relationships between a metric for the collisional energy at the boundary and measurable properties of <b>field-scaled</b> flows. In the third study, I measured erosion of synthetic bedrock samples in the 4 meter diameter drum to test three models for the relationship between bedrock erosion rate and measured basal forces: (1) erosion by impact wear resulting from forces due to bulk inertial solid stress (2) erosion by sliding wear scaled by bulk normal force (3) erosion by impact wear scaled by the square of the impulse exerted on the bed. Based on my experimental observations, I propose a debris flow erosion rule that includes components of both sliding and impact wear, whose relative importance is scaled by experimentally-tested variables. Finally, as part of my investigations of controls on boundary forces and bedrock wear, I observed grain segregation processes and fluid-sediment interactions that were previously undescribed in the literature. These included lateral oscillations of the flow front and the formation of asymmetric coarse-particle gyres.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} the {{relation}} between local- and <b>field-scale</b> solute transport parameters in an unsaturated soil profile is investigated. At two experimental sites, local-scale steady-state solute transport was measured in-situ using 120 horizontally installed TDR probes at 5 depths. Local-scale solute transport parameters determined from BTCs were used to predict <b>field-scale</b> solute transport using stochastic stream tube models (STM). Local-scale solute transport was described by two transport models: (1) the convection-dispersion transport model (CDE), and (2) the stochastic convective lognormat transfer model (CLT). The parameters of the CDE-model {{were found to be}} lognormally distributed, whereas the parameters of the CLT model were normally distributed. Local-scale solute transport heterogeneity within the measurement volume of a TDR-probe was an important factor causing <b>field-scale</b> solute dispersion. The study of the horizontal scale-dependency revealed that the variability in the solute transport parameters contributes more to the <b>field-scale</b> dispersion at deeper depths than at depths near the surface. Three STMs were used to upscale the local transport parameters: (i) the stochastic piston flow STM-I assuming local piston flow transport, (ii) the convective-dispersive STM-II assuming local CDE transport, and (iii) the stochastic convective lognormal STM-III assuming local CLT. The STM-I considerably underpredicted the <b>field-scale</b> solute dispersion indicating that local-scale dispersion processes, which are captured within the measurement volume of the TDR-probe, are important to predict <b>field-scale</b> solute transport. STM-II and STM-III both described the <b>field-scale</b> breakthrough curves (BTC) accurately if depth dependent parameters were used. In addition, a reasonable description of the horizontal variance of the local BTCs was found. STM-III was (more) superior to STM-II if only one set of parameters from one depth is used to predict the <b>field-scale</b> solute BTCs at several depths. This indicates that the local-scale solute transport process, as measured with TDR in this study, is in agreement with the CLT-hypothesis...|$|E

The motivation of stochastic analysis of heat transport at the field scale is therefore to quantify the enhanced growth of the <b>field-scale</b> second moments caused by the spatially varying specific discharge field. Within the framework of stochastic theory, an effective advection-dispersion equation containing effective parameters (namely, the macrodispersion coefficients) is developed to model the mean temperature field. The rate of growth of the <b>field-scale</b> spatial second moments of the mean temperature field in the principal coordinate directions is described by the macrodispersion coefficient. The variance of the temperature field is also developed to characterize the reliability to be anticipated in applying the mean heat transport model. It is found that the heterogeneity of the medium and the correlation length of the log hydraulic conductivity are important in enhancing the <b>field-scale</b> heat advection, while the effective thermal conductivity plays the role in reducing the <b>field-scale</b> heat advection...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} {{relationship}} between plant carbon assimilation and water loss {{as a function}} of environmental factors is critically important for improving managed agricultural systems. Water use efficiency (WUE) measures the carbon uptake of a plant relative to the water used by the plant. Over the years, it has been described at several spatial and temporal scales depending on methods available for carbon and water flux quantification. One approach for developing crop cultivars that are well adapted to water-limited conditions has been to use leaf-level measurements of carbon isotope ratios to identify those individuals that best conserve water. How this leaf-level water conservation translates to agronomic-scale water use has not been thoroughly demonstrated. This work investigated the leaf-scale and <b>field-scale</b> WUE of three crops, namely, soybean (Glycine max), Miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) for the years 2010 to 2014. Plant biomass harvested at the end each growing season was used for carbon isotopic analysis, a metric used to estimate leaf-level WUE. Further, grain and biomass yields, tile drainage and climate data (precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature) were used to calculate <b>field-scale</b> WUE and related metrics. Based on analysis of WUE at leaf and field scales for soybean at this study site, a 1 % increase in leaf-scale WUE showed ~ 10 % increment in <b>field-scale</b> WUE {{at the lower end of}} this relationship. Further, the leaf-level WUE explained 90 % of the annual variability in <b>field-scale</b> WUE perhaps showing that leaf-scale WUE is an effective breeding tool to improve <b>field-scale</b> WUE in soybean under these conditions. For Miscanthus and switchgrass, we observed that Miscanthus consistently outperformed switchgrass both in terms of biomass yield and <b>field-scale</b> WUE. Five-year averages of agronomic WUE for Miscanthus and switchgrass were 19 kg dry matter ha- 1 mm- 1 and 7 kg dry matter ha- 1 mm- 1. The difference in performance of Miscanthus and switchgrass at the study site, both under drought and non-drought conditions was due to subtle differences in the C 4 pathway between these crops...|$|E
