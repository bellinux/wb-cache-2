5|$|Development of an endometrial <b>hyperplasia</b> (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is a {{significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} <b>hyperplasia.</b> Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical <b>hyperplasia</b> is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial <b>hyperplasia</b> and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial <b>hyperplasia</b> typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} immunoexpression of p 53 in parathyroid tumors and <b>hyperplasias</b> and correlate it {{with the}} histopathological diagnosis and severity of hyperparathyroidism. Design: A total of 102 parathyroid tissues from archival paraffin-embedded specimens or obtained at surgery between 1988 and 1997 from 65 consecutive individuals with hyperparathyroidism were studied. Methods: p 53 immunoexpression, gland mass. preoperative serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were analyzed; 14 normal parathyroid glands were used as controls. Results: the histopathological findings were: adenomas (n= 28), primary <b>hyperplasias</b> (n= 12), secondary nodular and diffuse <b>hyperplasias</b> (patients with uremia, n= 57), carcinomas (n= 4) and carcinomatous metastatic tissue (n=l). Nuclear p 53 was detected in 36 % of the adenomas, 42 % of the primary hyperplastic glands, 72 % of the diffuse <b>hyperplasias.</b> 44 % of nodular <b>hyperplasias</b> and 40 % of the carcinomatous tissues, and was absent from normal glands, p 53 expression was significantly more frequent in diffuse <b>hyperplasias</b> than in adenomas (P= 0. 037). Serum ionized calcium tended to be higher in p 53 -positive glands in all histopathological groups: however, the difference was only significant in nodular <b>hyperplasias</b> (P= 0. 018). the same trend was observed for serum intact PTH levels of adenomas and nodular hyperplastic glands. Gland mass was not significantly different according to p 53 staining. Conclusions: p 53 immunoexpression was not useful in differentiating between the histopathological parathyroid subgroups, p 53 immunodetection was particularly frequent in secondary hyperplastic glands of uremic patients. Our study suggests that p 53, whether wild-type or mutant, is regulated in parathyroid tumors and <b>hyperplasias.</b> Changes in wild-type p 53 {{may be part of}} a cellular response to a hyperproliferative condition.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the expression of caspases 3, 6 and 8 and their association to apoptosis in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the breast. The material consisted of nine benign breast epithelial <b>hyperplasias,</b> 15 atypical <b>hyperplasias,</b> 74 in situ and 82 invasive carcinomas. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by the TUNEL method and caspase 3, 6 and 8 expression by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies. Increased caspase 3 immunopositivity, as compared to staining of normal breast ductal epithelium, was seen in 22 % of benign epithelial <b>hyperplasias,</b> 25 % of atypical <b>hyperplasias,</b> 58 % of in situ carcinomas and 90 % of invasive carcinomas. The corresponding percentages for caspase 6 and 8 were 11 %, 25 %, 60 %, 87 % and 22 %, 57 %, 84 %, 83 % respectively. In high-grade in situ lesions there were significantly more cases with strong caspase 3, 6 and 8 immunoreactivity than in low- and intermediate-grade lesions (P = 0. 0045, P = 0. 049 and P = 0. 0001 respectively). In invasive carcinomas, however, no association between a high tumour grade and caspase 3, 6 or 8 expression was found (P = 0. 27, P = 0. 26 and P = 0. 69 respectively). The mean apoptotic index was 0. 14 ± 0. 14 % in benign epithelial <b>hyperplasias,</b> 0. 17 ± 0. 12 % in atypical <b>hyperplasias,</b> 0. 61 ± 0. 88 % in in situ carcinomas and 0. 94 ± 1. 21 % in invasive carcinomas. In all cases strong caspase 3, 6 and 8 positivity was significantly associated with the extent of apoptosis (P < 0. 001, P = 0. 015 and P = 0. 050 respectively). The results show that synthesis of caspases 3, 6 and 8 is up-regulated in neoplastic breast epithelial cells in parallel to the increase in the apoptotic index and progression of the breast lesions. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

In experiment 1, in ICR mice, the incidences of adenocarcinomas in the ENU alone and the ENU+EE groups were 0 % and 37. 5 %, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. The incidences of atypical <b>hyperplasias</b> and endometrial <b>hyperplasias</b> in the ENU+EE group were also significantly higher {{than those in the}} ENU alone group. In rasH 2 mice, on the other hand, no endometrial proliferative lesions were induced in the uterus of the ENU+EE group, although uterine adenocarcinomas (55. 6 %), atypical <b>hyperplasias</b> (33. 3 %), and endometrial <b>hyperplasias</b> (22. 2 %) were observed in the ENU alone group.

5|$|Congenital adrenal <b>hyperplasia</b> is a {{congenital}} {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal <b>hyperplasia</b> is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the origin of bladder cancer, very early urothelial lesions must be investigated in addition to more advanced tumors. Tissue from 31 biopsies of 12 patients with urothelial <b>hyperplasias</b> and simultaneous or consecutive superficial papillary tumors were used to microdissect urothelium from 15 - microm sections of biopsies. The biopsies were obtained with the recently developed highly sensitive diagnostic method of 5 -aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence endoscopy (AFE). Besides flat and papillary urothelial neoplasms, the method of photodynamic diagnostics also detects simple urothelial <b>hyperplasias</b> as fluorescent positive lesions. In addition, 12 fluorescence-positive biopsies showing histologically normal urothelium were investigated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was done using a dual color staining technique of biotinylated centromeric probes of chromosomes 9 and 17 and digoxigenin-labeled gene-specific P 1 probes for chromosomes 9 q 22 (FACC), 9 p 21 (p 16 /CDKI 2), and 17 p 13 (p 53). Ten of 14 <b>hyperplasias</b> (70 %) showed deletions of chromosome 9.

Moreover, stable hyperplastic outgrowth lines were established as a tool to study premalignant PyV-mT-induced <b>hyperplasias</b> in detail.

METHODS: Tissue from 42 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 10 Hodgkin's lymphomas, three atypical <b>hyperplasias</b> and five benign reactive <b>hyperplasias</b> was studied immunohistochemically {{for the expression of}} p 53 protein. RESULTS: Of the 42 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 13 (31 %) were positive for p 53 in some of the tumour cells. In two cases the proportion of positive cells was more than 10 % and in four cases it was between 1 - 5 %. These six cases consisted of three Burkitt's lymphomas, one immunoblastic lymphoma, one centroblastic diffuse lymphoma and one angioimmunoblastic lymphoma. In seven cases the proportion of p 53 positive tumour cells was less than 1 %. These cases comprised three centroblastic diffuse, three centroblastic polymorphic diffuse, and one angioimmunoblastic type lymphoma. In three out of 10 (30 %) Hodgkin's lymphomas, a proportion of the Reed-Sternberg cells were p 53 positive. One of these was a mixed cellular subtype and two nodular sclerosing subtypes. p 53 protein was not expressed in the three atypical <b>hyperplasias</b> or the five benign reactive <b>hyperplasias</b> of the lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p 53 positivity in non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphomas indicates that mutations of the p 53 gene may play a part in the development of these tumours. The concentration of p 53 positivity in high grade lymphomas suggests that p 53 is involved in the transformation of low grade lymphomas to more aggressive types.

40|$|Both {{alveolar}} type II {{cells and}} Clara cells {{have been suggested}} as cells of origin of human bronchioloalveolar lung carcinomas and other pulmonary neoplasms, based {{on the presence of}} cell specific markers identified by immunocytochemical methods. Alveolar type II cell origin of solid and papillary lung tumors of the mouse has been demonstrated, and Clara cells have been suggested as cell of origin for hamster pulmonary neoplasms. Therefore, chemically induced bronchiolar <b>hyperplasias</b> and pulmonary neoplasms of Syrian golden hamsters were analyzed by avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry to localize a hamster-specific Clara cell antigen (CCA) and keratin. The hamsters had been treated subcutaneously with multiple doses of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). Proliferative lesions of low cuboidal, tall columnar, or pleomorphic cells were present within bronchioles or adjacent to airways in the alveolar parenchyma. Frequently areas of squamous cell differentiation were present focally or diffusely that were immunoreactive for cytokeratin. Immunoreactivity for cytokeratin was also noted for hyperplastic bronchiolar neuroepithelial bodies. Cellular <b>hyperplasias</b> extending out into the alveolar parenchyma contained ciliated cells and frequently consisted of cells immunoreactive for CCA, showing them to be of bronchiolar Clara cell origin. Tumors developed from bronchiolar cell <b>hyperplasias</b> localized within bronchioles and from bronchiolar cells lining former alveolar walls. Neoplastic growth patterns were tubulo-papillary, forming loose networks or densely cellular areas. Immunoreactivity for cytoplasmic CCA was found in 50 % of the tumors and was seen most frequently in small cuboidal cells and larger, vacuolated cells scattered throughout the neoplasms. In summary, evidence is presented that NDEA-induced pulmonary tumors of the Syrian golden hamster originated from cells lining bronchioles and from extrabronchiolar Clara cell <b>hyperplasias</b> of the terminal bronchioles.
