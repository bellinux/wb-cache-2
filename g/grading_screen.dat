Bridging the gap between home and school has received a lot of attention in the past decade and although numerous suggestions have been put forward, a pattern of hit-or-miss has developed. This research aims to present a suggestion of successful entry into the formal phase of education for every child, regardless of colour, at a much lower cost for both authorities and parents. In an attempt to determine the success of the Reception Class programme, three measures were used: the First <b>Grade</b> <b>Screening</b> Test (AGS), the HSRC Test for 5 - 6 year olds and as a qualitative measure a questionnaire completed by the class one teachers of the school where the Reception children entered the formal phase of education in 1990. Results of these tests showed that the Reception Class programme was the most successful in achieving a high level of school readiness and on all three measures these pupils did significantly better than their peers who had attended pre-primary schools, crèches, day-care centres and those who had come straight from home. An analysis of test items showed that the Reception Class pupils had excelled in areas involving concentration and listening skills, fine muscle control and application of knowledge. The HSRC Test for 5 - 6 year olds showed evidence of well developed problem solving skills and a sound knowledge of mathematical language.

The experimental method of research employing the Pre-test/ Post-test Control Group Design was used. Forty-four Head Start students participated in this study: twenty-two were randomly assigned to the control group and twenty-two to the experimental group, respectively. Parents of children in the experimental group received parent involvement training, and parents of children in the control group did not. The Brigance Kindergarten and First <b>Grade</b> <b>Screen</b> and the Self-Esteem Index were administered to both groups in January 1995 prior to the treatment and in May 1995 at the conclusion of the treatment. Results of the two tailed t-test used to test the null hypotheses showed a statistically significant difference in the academic achievement levels of the groups, and it was concluded that children whose parents received parent involvement training achieved at higher academic levels than children whose parents did not. Both the experimental group and the control group showed a slight gain in self-esteem; however, differences in mean gains were not statistically significant. Major implications of the study are that African American Head Start parents are responsive to parent involvement training and that an outcome of their involvement is improved student overall academic achievement. On the basis of the study results, the following recommendations have been made: 1. The local school board should provide additional funding for parent involvement training in urban and inner-city schools. 2. Similar studies should be conducted to determine the effects of parent involvement training on academic achievement and self-esteem among upper level elementary students in urban schools. 3.

This paper discusses reinforcement of polypropylene (PP) homopolymer with flax bast fibers. Maleic Anhydride modified PP (MAPP) <b>grades</b> are <b>screened</b> on coupling efficiency. Three mechanisms appear to be of great importance in the effectiveness of interphase modification: (i) the maleic anhydride (MA) content grafted per polymeric PP-chain; (ii) the molecular weight (MW) of MAPP; and (iii) the miscibility of MAPP/PP. The coupling efficiency of different MAPP grades, defined as the maximum increase in composite strength, has been investigated. It was found that for the homopolymer based MAPP varieties the MW of the compatibilizer is a more important parameter than the MA content. Low MW random copolymer-based MAPP varieties {{were found to be}} more effective in increasing flexural strength than high MW block copolymer-based MAPP varieties. Furthermore, a maximum in MAPP efficiency is sometimes seen; adding more coupling agent to the system does not additionally increase the composite mechanical properties.

Material & Methods Three Internet sources were searched by a strategy designed to include systematic reviews on inter-dental cleaning devices. Plaque and gingivitis scores were the primary parameters of interest. Characteristics of selected papers were extracted. The potential risk of bias was estimated and the acquired evidence was <b>graded.</b> Results <b>Screening</b> of 395 papers resulted in six systematic reviews. Two papers evaluated the efficacy of dental floss, two of inter-dental brushes (IDB), one of woodsticks and one of the oral irrigator. Weak evidence of unclear or small magnitude was retrieved that supported dental floss, woodsticks and the oral irrigator to reduce gingivitis in addition to toothbrushing. No concomitant evidence for an effect on plaque emerged. There is moderate evidence that IDBs in combination with toothbrushing reduce both plaque and gingivitis.

Preferential grade by size data obtained by an extensive belt cut sampling campaign after primary crushing has been used to develop a method to define samples that are amenable for metal preconcentration by size.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of special reading upon academic performance in reading of children in grade one. For this purpose a six months experiment was conducted in three similar schools. Special reading was implemented in one of two settings; one group received special reading in the school reading clinic under the direction of the reading specialist; a second group received instruction from the classroom teacher using the reading specialist as a resource person. Designated control, one group received no aid from the reading specialist. Children in the special reading groups had ranked in the low third on a screening test. Their reading achievement was evaluated as well as that of pupils who ranked in the middle and upper thirds in classrooms where special programs were implemented for the low third in one of two settings. Instruments used in the study were the First <b>Grade</b> <b>Screening</b> Test, The Screening Test for Assigning Remedial Treatment, the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test and a scale calculated to gain information about a dimension of per-called "locus of control". This scale is the StricklandNorwicki Scale. The results of the reading achievement test served as a basis for comparison, using analysis of variance to test four null hypotheses. Data obtained from the Strickland-Norwicki Scale were not subjected to statistical analysis but were described with reference to the groups. Results from the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test revealed that there were no significant differences in reading achievement between the three groups of pupils, those enrolled in either of the two special reading groups or the control group. These groups were comprised of pupils who had scored in the low third on the screening test. Students who ranked in the upper third in classrooms where special reading was implemented for the lower third achieved significantly higher than did top third students whose low third classmates received no aid from the reading specialist. This was also true when the upper and middle thirds were combined. When scores of the middle third alone were analyzed no significant differences resulted. The Strickland-Norwicki Scale revealed that perceptions of environment were nearly equally distributed between feelings of being internally and externally controlled for the total group. When viewing the scores of the three groups individually, the special reading outside classroom group had the more positive orientation, internal control, as evaluated by this scale. It was concluded that special reading is valuable to first-grade pupils although in this study those directly participating in the experimental special reading groups did not show significantly higher achievement than did those who did not receive it. However, students who had been deemed more ready for reading instruction as evaluated by a screening test, (upper third or combined middle and upper third) whose low third classmates were enrolled in a program of special reading, gained some indirect benefits of special reading. They achieved significantly higher reading achievement test scores than did students who also ranked in the upper third, or middle and upper third combined, in classrooms which did not provide special reading for classmates ranking in the low third.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of poor reading skills is particularly high among children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, but no longitudinal {{studies have been}} conducted so far in France to determine whether poor reading in a socioeconomically challenged population is persistent and warrants preventive action. DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-four children were divided into three groups according to their reading skills: poor, intermediate and typical readers. They were followed over a period of 2 years. Reading levels, spelling and comprehension were assessed by standardized measurement scales in order to determine reading outcome and predictive variables. RESULTS: The reading skills in each group progressed at similar rates, but the differences between the three groups remained relatively constant over the 2 years. The gap between good and poor readers actually increased for the poorest readers. Spelling scores followed a similar pattern and remained weak. Comprehension scores followed a different pattern. Most of the initially poor readers with low comprehension scores almost caught up and reached the level of the typical readers. The best predictive variables of reading and spelling outcome were phonological awareness, rapid naming and attention deficit. The strongest predictive variables for comprehension were IQ, lexical level and attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the relative stability of reading measurement across time in poor readers from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Their behavior are similar to the classic dyslexic population. The predictive variables are different depending on whether reading or spelling or comprehension is considered. These results provide a clear agenda for preventive literacy action in children with low socioeconomic levels (SES) : phonological decoding and oral language skills in early <b>grades,</b> and <b>screening</b> and treatment of attention disorders...|$|R
