5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, <b>hemolysis</b> develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. <b>Hemolysis</b> may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} why Wilson's disease causes <b>hemolysis,</b> but various lines of {{evidence}} suggest that {{a high level of}} free (non-ceruloplasmin bound) copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of hemoglobin, inhibition of energy-supplying enzymes in the red blood cell, or direct damage to the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. <b>Hemolysis,</b> renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of <b>hemolysis,</b> and staining.|$|E
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. <b>Hemolysis</b> (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. <b>Hemolysis</b> may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular <b>hemolysis</b> causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative <b>hemolysis</b> that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
25|$|When alpha <b>hemolysis</b> (α-hemolysis) is present, the agar {{under the}} colony {{is dark and}} greenish. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{and a group of}} oral streptococci (Streptococcus viridans or viridans streptococci) display alpha <b>hemolysis.</b> This is {{sometimes}} called green <b>hemolysis</b> because of the color change in the agar. Other synonymous terms are incomplete <b>hemolysis</b> and partial <b>hemolysis.</b> Alpha <b>hemolysis</b> is caused by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacterium, oxidizing hemoglobin to green biliverdin.|$|E
25|$|Artifacts such as <b>hemolysis,</b> lipemia, and icteremia {{can also}} affect accuracy. <b>Hemolysis</b> {{releases}} Jaffe-reacting chromogens and therefore will falsely increase results. Lipemia and icteremia can inhibit optical readings and falsely decrease values. The procedure {{has been developed}} over time with the intention to minimize these interferents.|$|E
25|$|Subclinical PNH. PNH {{abnormalities}} on {{flow cytometry}} without signs of <b>hemolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tissue destruction, {{which can}} occur in <b>hemolysis,</b> surgery, infarction, crush syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, {{cerebral}} bleeding, etc.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} as {{to whether}} steroids (such as prednisolone) can decrease the severity of hemolytic crises. Transfusion therapy may be needed; in addition to correcting significant anemia, this suppresses the production of PNH cells by the bone marrow, and indirectly {{the severity of the}} <b>hemolysis.</b> Iron deficiency develops with time, due to losses in urine, and may have to be treated if present. Iron therapy can result in more <b>hemolysis</b> as more PNH cells are produced.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} {{can also cause}} {{mechanical}} hemolytic anemia with <b>hemolysis</b> of the red blood cells as they pass through the valve.|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include massive tissue swelling, pain, ecchymosis, hemorrhagic blebs, and necrosis. Systemic symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, coagulopathy, clinical bleeding and <b>hemolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemolysis</b> is {{the general}} term for {{excessive}} breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in hemolytic anemia.|$|E
25|$|Hemotoxins cause <b>hemolysis,</b> the {{destruction}} of red blood cells (erythrocytes), or induce blood coagulation (clotting). A common family of hemotoxins are snake venom metalloproteinases.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia can be {{developed}} after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for <b>hemolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beta <b>hemolysis</b> (β-hemolysis), {{sometimes}} called complete <b>hemolysis,</b> {{is a complete}} lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There {{are two types of}} streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in β-hemolysis under the surface of blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), displays beta <b>hemolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} measure is prevention – avoidance {{of the drugs}} and foods that cause <b>hemolysis.</b> Vaccination against some common pathogens (e.g. hepatitis A and hepatitis B) may prevent infection-induced attacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of esophageal spasm, erectile dysfunction, and abdominal pain {{are attributed to}} the fact that hemoglobin released during <b>hemolysis</b> binds with circulating nitric oxide, a substance that is needed to relax smooth muscle. This theory is supported by the fact that these symptoms improve on administration of nitrates or sildenafil (Viagra), which improves the effect of nitric oxide on muscle cells. There is a suspicion that chronic <b>hemolysis</b> causing chronically depleted nitric oxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lung), which in turn puts strain on the heart and causes heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} is generally suspected when patients from certain ethnic groups (see epidemiology) develop anemia, jaundice {{and symptoms of}} <b>hemolysis</b> after challenges {{from any of the}} above causes, especially when there is a positive family history.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{tests in}} PNH show changes {{consistent}} with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; {{there can be}} raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) {{if there is no}} iron deficiency present. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the <b>hemolysis</b> of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the <b>hemolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Urea with σ=.59 was {{introduced}} in 1956 due to low molecular weight and slow penetration of BBB. However, it can cause rebound effects and side effects such as intravascular <b>hemolysis</b> and phlebitis. When Urea is administered, the dosage is 1.5 g/kg or 0.5 g/kg (for elderly).|$|E
25|$|In medicine, LDH {{is often}} used as a marker of tissue {{breakdown}} as LDH is abundant in red blood cells and can function as a marker for <b>hemolysis.</b> A blood sample that has been handled incorrectly can show false-positively high levels of LDH due to erythrocyte damage.|$|E
25|$|Some weakly beta-hemolytic species cause intense beta <b>hemolysis</b> when grown {{together}} with a strain of Staphylococcus. This is called the CAMP test. Streptococcus agalactiae displays this property. Clostridium perfringens can be identified presumptively with this test. Listeria monocytogenes is also positive on sheep's blood agar.|$|E
25|$|Glycerol with σ=.48 was {{introduced}} in 1964, {{but it has a}} likelihood of exhibiting rebound effects and causing side effects such as <b>hemolysis,</b> hemoglobinuria, renal failure, hyperosmolar coma and nausea. When Glycerol is used, the dosage is 1.2 g/kg followed by 0.5-1 g/kg for 3–4 hours.|$|E
25|$|Other uses are {{assessment}} of tissue breakdown in general; {{this is possible}} {{when there are no}} other indicators of <b>hemolysis.</b> It is used to follow up cancer (especially lymphoma) patients, as cancer cells have a high rate of turnover, with destroyed cells leading to an elevated LDH activity.|$|E
25|$|To further {{elucidate}} {{the causes of}} jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler {{to look at other}} liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (<b>hemolysis,</b> etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Vacutainers {{are widely}} used in {{phlebotomy}} in developed countries due to safety and ease of use. Vacutainers {{have the advantage of}} being prepared with additives, allowing easy multi-tube draws, and having a lower chance of <b>hemolysis.</b> In developing countries, it is still common to draw blood using a syringe or syringes.|$|E
25|$|In South America, dapsone {{has been}} tried at 100mg/day for one week, unless there is active <b>hemolysis</b> or G6PD deficiency. No {{controlled}} trials have been reported; the practice is controversial, but clinical experience in Perú and several limited studies support this practice. Systemic corticosteroids are often considered, but without clinical trials to support the practice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the acute}} phase of <b>hemolysis,</b> blood transfusions might be necessary, or even {{dialysis}} in acute kidney failure. Blood transfusion {{is an important}} symptomatic measure, as the transfused red cells are generally not G6PD deficient and will live a normal lifespan in the recipient's circulation. Those affected should avoid drugs such as aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{degrees of}} <b>hemolysis</b> and {{intermittent}} episodes of vascular occlusion resulting in tissue ischemia and acute and chronic organ dysfunction; complications include anemia, jaundice, predisposition to aplastic crisis, sepsis, cholelithiasis, and delayed growth. Diagnosis suspected in infants or {{young children with}} painful swelling of the hands and feet, pallor, jaundice, pneumococcal sepsis or meningitis, severe anemia with splenic enlargement, or acute chest syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of TTP {{is based on}} the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, a negative direct antiglobulin test (coombs test), elevated levels of <b>hemolysis</b> markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.|$|E
25|$|HELLP {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} <b>hemolysis</b> (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.|$|E
25|$|USS {{can present}} {{similar to the}} {{following}} diseases which have to be excluded: fulminant infections, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome, the typical and atypical form of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), HELLP (<b>hemolysis,</b> elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, pre-eclampsia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), cancer that is often accompanied with metastasis, kidney injury, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and side effects from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
