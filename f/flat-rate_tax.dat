In that congress the party presented a program of 9 important political points. The third congress took place in Zurich on 5 March 2011, where party members voted to launch a national referendum blocking the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> incentive favoring foreign millionaires which financial lobbies had sought to enthrone as a Swiss constitutionial amendment. The same referendum in the canton of Zurich, originating with the Alternative List, was earlier approved in that Canton by Zurich's voters with a 52.9% majority in February 2009. The third congress was at the 30th juny in Biel with a discussion with Stéphane Hessel in the afternoon.|$|E

On 5 October 1946, an AWU delegation met with the Alake {{but there was still}} no result. The situation actually took {{a turn for the worse}} when the Alake increased [...] "the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> on women, an action supported by the British resident." [...] It was then that the AWU began their mass protests, such as marching outside the chief’s palace and demanding the abolishment of direct taxation. [...] "In mid- October 1946, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti led nearly a thousand women in a march to the Afin to protest the increase." [...] The response from the colonial authorities was brutal.

5000|$|The <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> {{was changed}} to a {{variable}} rate, dependent on the property value, in 1778. People who were exempt from paying church or poor rates, for reasons of poverty, were exempt from the window tax. Window tax was relatively unintrusive and easy to assess. Manchester Royal Infirmary had to pay a tax of 1/9d per window on {{the windows of the}} rooms occupied by staff of the infirmary in 1841 - a total of £1 9/9d. [...] Certain rooms, particularly dairies, cheeserooms and milkhouses were exempt providing they were clearly labelled, and {{it is not uncommon to}} find the name of such rooms carved on the lintel. The bigger the house, the more windows it was likely to have, and the more tax the occupants would pay. Nevertheless, the tax was unpopular, because it was seen by some as a tax on [...] "light and air".|$|E

5000|$|Alternately, David Schweickart {{proposes a}} <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> on capital assets to replace all other {{business}} taxes. This [...] "capital assets tax" [...] is collected and invested {{by the central}} government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable project proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds {{is to be used}} for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level.

Bruce Bartlett has stated that [...] "public opinion polls have long shown that support for <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> reforms is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, with support dropping off sharply at a rate higher than 23%." [...] If the FairTax is presented like all real world U.S. sales taxes and foreign VATs (tax-exclusive), the rate would be presented as 30%. Opponents argue the 30% tax-exclusive figure is better understood by the general populace and that the use of the 23% tax-inclusive number is deceptive and misleading. Proponents state that the 23% presentation is easier to compare to the inclusive income tax rates being replaced.|$|E
5000|$|Tennessee, {{which has}} only a limited income tax that {{excludes}} wages and salaries, began imposing its own special form of jock tax in July 2009, which it called a [...] "privilege tax", and later repealed in April 2014. The tax was unique in several respects. First, it was a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> of $2,500 per game, imposed on all players who were on a team's roster for a game in the state, including Tennessee residents. However, the tax applied {{to a maximum of}} three games per calendar year. In another quirk, NFL players were exempt—when first imposed, the tax only applied to NBA and NHL players. In addition, the tax did not go to the state treasury. Instead, taxes imposed on NHL players went to the operators of Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, home to the Nashville Predators, while taxes imposed on NBA players went to the operators of FedExForum in Memphis, home to the Memphis Grizzlies (both teams are Tennessee's only representatives in their respective leagues). Finally, because the tax was categorized as a fee, it could not be claimed as a deduction on other states' tax returns.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the incidence of}} commodity taxes, finding that, when demand and marginal cost schedules are linear. the burden of commodity taxation is distributed between buyers and sellers so that each suffers the same percentage reduction on pre-tax surplus. This equiproportionate reduction in surplus is the outcome of commodity taxes set at any rate, and is unaffected by relative demand and supply elasticities. Hence, when demand and marginal cost schedules are linear, commodity <b>taxes</b> resemble <b>flat-rate</b> <b>taxes</b> imposed on market surplus. Similar results apply to nonlinear schedules with certain ranges. ...|$|R

Opponents believe, however, that the tax burden under a flat-rate plan might fall more heavily upon the middle class and, unless exceptions were made, would hurt educational institutions and charities.

Third, {{what are the implications}} for time allocated to learning when we change taxes and spending? For an economy calibrated to the U. S. data along the lines of Lucas (1990), we find that the growth effects of changes in capital income tax rates are negligible despite the distortionary government spending; simultaneous changes in taxes and spending on education have modest effects on growth; and the learning time is unresponsive to changes in taxes. While the first two results are consistent with the U. S. data, the third one is not: during the 20 th century, the learning time has increased dramatically along with taxes.

40|$|This paper applies a {{numerical}} optimization technique using microunit tax {{data to the}} problem of choosing the parameters of a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> system, should one be desired. Our approach is to first formulate explicit objectives that a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> might reasonably be designed to meet, such as minimizing the extent of changes in households' tax burdens and minimizing the efficiency cost of the tax system. The next step uses an optimization algorithm to calculate the flat-rate schedule which comes closest to meeting the objectives,subject to the constraint that it raise the same revenue as the current incometax system. The calculations are carried out using a sample of 947 tax returns randomly drawn from the Treasury Tax File for 1977 which are updated to repro-duce the pattern of tax returns that would be filed in 1982. The analysis shows that the flat-rate system which minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations in tax liabilities features a marginal tax rate between 0. 204 and 0. 254, though a different definition of tax burden changes which puts more emphasis on reproducing the tax burdens of high-income households has an optimal marginal tax rate of 0. 382. We also derive the optimal flat-rate schedules when another objective is to minimize the efficiency cost of the tax system. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{study the}} effects of {{progressive}} taxes in conventional endogenous growth models augmented to include heterogeneous households. In contrast to representative agent models with <b>flat-rate</b> <b>taxes,</b> this framework allows us to distinguish between marginal tax rates and the empirical proxies that are typically used for these rates such as the share of tax revenue, or government expenditures, in GDP. The analysis then illustrates how the endogenous nature of these proxy variables causes them to be weakly correlated, or even increase, with economic growth. This study, therefore, helps explain why cross-country regressions have mostly failed to uncover the distortional growth effects of taxes. In fact, while past U. S. tax reforms appear to have contributed only small increases in per capita GDP growth, the authors' analysis nevertheless suggests that differences in tax codes across countries explain a two and a half percent variation in cross-sectional growth rates. Finally, the authors show that progressivity also introduces significant lags in {{the effects of}} tax changes on output growth. Taxation...|$|R

40|$|Progressive {{income taxes}} lead to distortions in {{economic}} decisions made across tax years. This {{is particularly important}} when income is volatile, {{as in the case}} of agriculture. Progressive taxes, therefore, can fundamentally change economic behavior over time. This study explores how progressive income taxes influence storage decisions and the markets for storable commodities. Under a progressive tax system, commodity storage tends to be lower in the aggregate and, as a consequence, price volatility increases. These distortions could be eliminated by introducing a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> or by changing the tax reporting system for farmers. Copyright 1999, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{develops}} global indexes of the progressivity and the redistributive {{effects of}} taxes and transfers, based on Lorenz curves and Gini indexes.

The global tax system becomes proportional to income, whereas it was still progressive with the actual VAT rate of 6. 5 %. The article presents the properties of a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> and concludes that only a negative income tax, or more generally a transfer to the lower incomes, can compensate the regressivity of a 15 % VAT and preserve the progressivity of the federal tax system. ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{a family}} of models of tax evasion, where a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>tax</b> {{finances}} only the provision of public goods, neglecting audits and wage differences. We focus on the comparison of two modeling approaches. The first is based on optimizing agents, who are endowed with social preferences, their utility being the sum of private consumption and moral utility. The second approach involves agents acting according to simple heuristics. We find that while we encounter the traditionally shaped Laffer-curve in the optimizing model, the heuristics models exhibit (linearly) increasing Laffercurves. This difference is related to a peculiar type of behavior emerging within the heuristics based approach: a number of agents lurk in a moral state of limbo, alternating between altruism and selfishness...|$|E

Households face a progressive income tax schedule, mimicking the Federal Income <b>tax,</b> and <b>flat-rate</b> <b>taxes</b> that capture payroll, state and local taxes and the corporate income tax. We find that a tilt of the Federal income tax schedule towards high earners leads to small increases in revenues which are maximized at an effective marginal tax rate of about 36. 1 % for the richest 5 % of households – in contrast to 21. 3 % marginal rate in the benchmark economy. Maximized revenue from Federal income taxes is 7. 7 % higher {{than it is in the}} benchmark economy, while revenues from all sources increase only by about 1 %. The room for higher revenues from more progressive taxes is even lower when the average taxes are higher to start with.
