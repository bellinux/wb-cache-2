50|$|MCS has {{a strong}} high school {{counseling}} program, in which school faculty orchestrate a weekly High School Placement class for eighth graders. During this class, which begins in the first weeks of school and ends near winter break, Deans or Associate Deans of Admission come to MCS and provide information about the schools that they represent. Schools that have visited MCS include: The Dwight-Englewood School, The Northfield Mount Hermon School, Suffield Academy and The Calhoun school. Only independent day and boarding schools are scheduled for appointments at the school. In addition, eighth graders are equipped with a public school directory book, listing the all public schools in New York City. The same is for parochial schools. An ISEE Test and SSAT <b>guidance</b> <b>course</b> is also offered to eighth graders, taught by an instructor from a testing organization from outside of the school. MCS faculty realize that applying to high schools is a toilsome experience, so students are always welcome to share their feelings with high school counselors in the Third Floor Office.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of support reciprocity in the relationships with principals and colleagues on self-efficacy and burnout among teachers. The respondents wore 122 school teachers (51 elementary school teachers, 9 junior high school teachers, 44 senior high school teachers, 17 teachers of school for the disabled, and 1 unidentified by school). They completed measures of social support exchange in the relationships with principals and colleagues, measurements of self-efficacy in student <b>guidance,</b> <b>course</b> instruction, and job relations, and a burnout assessment with a Japanese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Teachers, support reciprocity in the relationships with principals related significantly to their self-efficacy in course instruction and job relations, and marginally significantly to their self-efficacy in student guidance.

40|$|A {{relatively}} small number of alternative col- lision avoidance control behaviors are formulated by con- sidering nominal and evasive maneuvers. The control behaviors are generated by varying two parameters: Offsets to the <b>guidance</b> <b>course</b> angle commanded to the autopilot, and offset the propulsions command ranging from keep speed to full reverse. Using simulated predictions of the trajectories of the obstacles and ship, the compliances with the COLREGS rules and collision hazards associated with each of the alternative control behaviors are evaluated on a finite prediction horizon into the future, and the optimal control behavior is selected. The method is conceptually and computationally simple and yet quite versatile and powerful as it can account for the dynamics of the ship, its steering and propulsion system, forces due to wind and ocean current, and any number of obstacles. Simulations show that the method is effective and can manage complex scenarios with multiple dynamic obstacles and uncertainty in sensors and predictions...|$|E
40|$|The output {{tracking}} problem is investigated for a nonlinear affine system with multiple modes of continuous control inputs. We convert {{the family of}} nonlinear affine systems under consideration into a switched hybrid system by introducing a multiple-valued logic variable. The Fliess functional expansion is adopted to express the input and output relationship of the switched hybrid system. The optimal switching control is determined for a multiple-step output tracking performance index. The proposed approach is applied to a multitarget {{tracking problem}} for a flight vehicle aiming for one real target with several decoys flying around it in the terminal <b>guidance</b> <b>course.</b> These decoys appear as apparent targets {{and have to be}} distinguished with the approaching of the flight vehicle. The guidance problem of one flight vehicle versus multiple apparent targets should be considered if no large miss distance might be caused due to the limitation of the flight vehicle maneuverability. The target orientation at each time interval is determined. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of modular instructional design on the academic achievement and long-term retention of Textile Education teachers who attend a <b>Guidance</b> <b>course</b> and whose learning styles are dependent, independent and collaborative. In the study, experimental models were used. The Subjects of the study consisted of fourth year students in the Department of Textile Education, Technical Education Faculty, who took the Guidance Courses. The Experimental group consisted of 55 students who were randomly selected. For the Experimental group, modular instruction style was used and for the Control group, expression-based (classic) instruction style was used. A Learning Style Scale, academic success test, and modular instructional design were used in this study. Two important results were obtained at the end of this study: 1. The Experimental group’s academic achievement and long-term retention levels were higher than the Control group’s academic achievement and long-term retention levels. 2. The academic achievement levels of students who have independent and collaborative learning styles were higher than students who have dependent learning styles. These results supported the hypothesis that modular instruction style positively affects the academic achievement and long-term retention levels of students who have different learning styles...|$|E

40|$|The {{personal}} developmental {{levels of}} students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds were studied; and the hypothesis that students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds would be less mature than {{other students in the}} developmental levels of autonomy, purpose, and interpersonal relationships was assessed. The effects of participation in a semester course of self-development and career exploration were also studied. The sample included 78 freshmen (22 males and 46 females) enrolled in a self-development and career exploration course at Murray State University (Kentucky) during the fall quarter of 1981. Of these, 39 were enrolled in the university's program of Special Services for Disadvantaged Students (SSDS). Each was administered the Student Development Task Inventory of R. B. Winston and others (1979), an instrument designed to measure individual growth and development of college students. The effects of the course were evaluated through pretest and posttest scores. No significant differences were found in the developmental levels {{of students from}} disadvantaged backgrounds and regularly admitted students, and no differences were found in the pretest and posttest scores of the two groups. Posttest scores improved for both groups, an indication of the possible advantages of the course.

40|$|Thesis (PhD.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This {{research}} is a qualitative {{study of a}} short project set up to explore the uses of a visual arts-based approach for addressing HIV and AIDS through teacher development. It was undertaken at the University of KwaZulu-Natal {{in the face of}} the HIV and AIDS pandemic. It responds to the suggestions that teachers need to explore their own understanding, attitudes and perceptions of the disease if they are to deal confidently with the demands it places on them as educators in schools. Thirteen preservice teachers, who had enrolled in a <b>guidance</b> <b>course,</b> used photographs and drawing to capture their views of HIV and AIDS and to construct messages for their peers. Methods for the approach were adapted from the work of Ewald and Lightfoot (2001) and from Wang’s (1999) photo-voice. A visual arts-based approach was chosen for its potential to simultaneously engage the mind, body and emotions (Weber & Mitchell, 2004). Drawing on the conceptual work of Banks (2001), Hall (1997) and Fairclough (1995), the photo texts were then analysed by the researcher who saw them as socially and culturally embedded constructions and was interested in how they were affected by and could have an impact on culture and social discourses. Reflections on the photo texts and their associated processes by both the researcher and pre-service teachers lead to suggestions as to the pedagogic possibilities of using a visual arts-based approach in education to address HIV and AIDS. The thesis concludes with discussion of what a visual arts-based approach can contribute to HIV and AIDS in teacher education and comments on the challenges and limitations of such an approach...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis interprets {{constructions of}} {{everyday}} life at a help centre in Norway to families struggling with psychological difficulties and/or drug problems {{from the perspectives of}} employees and voluntary helpers. The actor – oriented perspective and the constructivist perspective within the social studies of children and childhood are prominent in the analysis chapters 5, 6 and 7. Chapter 5 is a descriptive chapter and focuses on how everyday life is constructed at the centre from the views of employees and helpers. Chapter 6 explores the creation of “a nice time” and its various meanings in everyday life at the centre to visiting families. Chapter 7 analysis different perceptions on childhood, parents and families, and in which ways the families are assisted and guided in what the employees communicate as “good” enough childhoods, parents and families. To attain knowledge, insights and understanding of constructing everyday life at the help centre, and in which ways the families were assisted and guided; participant observations for two days in 4 weeks and 11 interviews were carried out. Employees and voluntary helpers were my informants. Findings suggest that to create “a nice time” at the centre, several elements are involved, such as “a home snuggly atmosphere” and “doing something positive together”. Various views on children and childhoods are found among my informants. A particular view was on children as vulnerable, fragile and in need of parents’ (adults’) protection, whereas a Romantic discourse is central. Another view highlighted the competent child, where dandelion children were frequently promoted by my informants in interviews. The employees assist and guide children and parents in “good enough” childhoods, parenting and families through various activities and services at the centre. Various needs are looked after, and the parental <b>guidance</b> <b>course</b> and the children’s group are two of many offers illustrating that. Other activities, such as meals and vacations may assist and guide these families to be “good enough” families and to let them experience how meals and vacations are organized, not only for such families, but for everyone. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{piece of}} {{research}} {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the assessments made by secondary teachers in training of an introductory orientation course offered during the first seven weeks of the 1984 H. D. E. course in the Department of Education of Rhodes University. This course, the About To Teach (ATT) course, was introduced in an attempt to obviate some of the perceived problems that students experience in the initial months of their H. D. E. year. The course was first offered in 1982 and in both 1982 and 1983 it was assessed by the students. The evaluation of the assessments offered in those two years provided much of the background for this in-depth look at student assessments of the 1984 ATT course. Briefly, the course attempts to offer the students a stimulating, meaningful, interesting and enjoyable learning experience which will help them to orientate; prepare them adequately for their first teaching practice and the reception later of the offerings of the core theory discipline of Philosophy, Sociology and Psychology. The course itself is a piece of action research and its underlying assumptions are essentially humanistic in nature. Its planners have attempted to bracket as many assumptions as possible and to espouse only those assumptions which are basically positive in nature. It does not attempt to prescribe or offer any dogma which can or must be assessed in any formal sense; it attempts to meet the students from whatever stages in their development they are at when they arrive to commence their H. D. E. year; and it does not attempt to compel the students in any way whatsoever. It is a course which must stand or fall on its own merits. Since the researcher is himself an involved participant in the process, he felt that the completion of a detailed questionnaire and interviews with a sample of the students would be the most economical and the best means of obtaining data for as objective an analysis as possible. To further obviate the possibility of researcher bias all the responses collected have been included in the appendices so that the reader may satisfy him/herself that the interpretations made and conclusions drawn are reasonable. Briefly, the chief conclusion of this researcher is that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} students perceived the course as offering them a meaningful learning experience. In addition, it can be argued that the course is, in effect, a <b>guidance</b> <b>course</b> in that it appears to be preparing students for experiences which they still have to come across. Most are generally critical of other courses offered during the H. D. E. year and many make an appeal for, or suggest, a much more integrated approach along the lines of the ATT course. There is a definite appeal for a coherent H. D. E. experience which is meaningful and 'peoplecentred'. By no stretch of the imagination can the findings of this particular piece of research be generalised to any other context since it is very definitely specific in both context and setting. However the researcher is quietly confident that his conclusions and recommendations make a great deal of sense within the specific context of this study...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 100 first year Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) students was carried out using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of total eight close-ended questions, which included demographic (age and gender) and career choice-related items. Data was collected, analyzed, and was represented as numbers and percentage. Results: The response rate was 100 %. Majority of the students (80 %) chose dentistry as a professional career as compared to the 20 % who got in by chance. About 72 % of them chose dentistry because of their interest, 13 % because they were unable to procure a seat in medicine and 10 % due to family influence. Majority of them (85 %) had undergone career <b>guidance</b> <b>courses</b> in school and were told about various career options.
