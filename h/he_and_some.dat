5|$|In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University {{to study}} biology. There <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> friends decided {{to revive the}} {{informal}} Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958. They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov, the editor of Boomerang (1960), and Yuri Galanskov who issued the Phoenix (1961), two examples of literary samizdat.|$|E
5|$|He did not tarry long there either: on December 12–13, {{he was in}} Kraków; on December 17, in Wrocław; {{and shortly}} after, he settled in Leipzig, where many notable Polish {{soldiers}} and politicians formed an émigré community. Soon <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. The politicians, grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries, including Ignacy Działyński. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them, his support was a major boon to them, as {{he was among the}} most popular individuals in Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1755 {{he participated}} as a {{volunteer}} aide in the ill-fated expedition of General Edward Braddock, where he distinguished himself in the retreat following the climactic Battle of Monongahela. He served from 1755 until 1758 as colonel and commander of the Virginia Regiment, directing the provincial defenses against French and Indian raids and building the regiment {{into one of the}} best-trained provincial militias of the time. He led the regiment as part of the 1758 expedition of General John Forbes that successfully drove the French from Fort Duquesne, during which <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of his companies were involved in a friendly fire incident. Unable to get a commission in the British Army, Washington then resigned from the provincial militia, married, and took up the life of a Virginia plantation owner.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, the brig Governor Endicott, of Salem, H. H. Jenks, master, {{was engaged}} in the pepper trade {{on the coast of}} Sumatra when she had {{occasion}} to help free Friendship, also of Salem, Charles Endicott, master, from Malay pirates. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of his officers had gone ashore to negotiate for pepper in the town of Quallah Battoo when pirates took over the ship, murdered some of her crew and looted the cargo. Captain Endicott obtained aid from Governor Endicott and the ship James Monroe, of New York, J.

5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what {{he could}} of the western workings, before <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of the survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians {{as far north as}} present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of aggression is seen {{as one of the first}} military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E

5|$|William Abb Cannon {{was born}} in Neshoba County, Mississippi to Harvey and Virgie Cannon. The family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father worked during World War II. While {{attending}} Istrouma High School in Baton Rouge, Cannon drew attention for his speed, strength and size; he exceled in football, basketball, and track. In football in 1955, his senior year, Cannon scored 39 touchdowns, was included in All-State and All-America teams, and led the Istrouma Indians to a state championship. Although generally appearing in just {{the first half of}} games, he scored 229 points that season, a state record at the time. In track and field, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds and threw the shot-put over 56 feet, setting what were state records at the time for both events. In the summer of 1955, Cannon received a 90-day suspended sentence for theft; <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> friends were caught extorting money from men whom they had seen with prostitutes. This was {{the first in a series}} of legal troubles in Cannon's life.|$|E
5|$|Diarist John Evelyn {{lived in}} Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652. Evelyn {{inherited}} {{the house when}} he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652. On his return to England at the Restoration, Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of his fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar, who got drunk with his friends and, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed {{their way through a}} fine holly hedge. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy Victualling Yard, which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualing Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All that remains is the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualing Yard.|$|E

During the first half-hour, a number of Wilkinson's men were killed or wounded. After Wilkinson himself was shot in the leg, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of the other wounded were moved to the lake side of the cabin which provided some protective cover.|$|E

Many members of the Debs caucus resigned from SDUSA, {{and some of them}} formed the Socialist Party USA. The changing of the name of the Socialist Party of America to SDUSA and the 1973 formation of DSOC and the SPUSA represented a split in the U.S.socialist movement.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Murmelstein, a rabbi from Vienna, {{had been}} part of the Cultural Council in Vienna after the Anschluss. As in other cities, the Jews were charged by the Nazis with organising actions in the Jewish community, {{including}} selection of people for transport when the Germans decided to deport them, beginning in 1942. Murmelstein was also deported to Theresienstadt. In late 1944, he succeeded Eppstein. He and other prominent Jews of the Cultural Council were deported to Auschwitz in the liquidation of the ghetto, but <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> others survived the war. He and other Jewish elders have been extremely controversial figures, condemned for years for what was seen as their collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, local stories {{were still being}} told of this period of warring and trade establishment. George Washington was about fifteen miles below Wheeling, Marshall County {{according}} to his entry on Thursday October 25, 1770. An early Cut Creek Indian town was wiped out on Cut Creek (Fish Creek) by the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee) according to the hired Crawford Indians (William Crawford (soldier) Iroquois-like George Ck neighbors) and the two Croghan Indians aboard with him from White Mingos Castle. These western Virginia Indians explained the geography of each stream they passed on the Ohio River to and up the Great Kanawha. With some of the hired Indians, George Washington spent the night of November 2, 1770 at the old hunters camp at the 10 Mile Creek {{before returning to the}} main camp at the Mouth of the Kanawha. A few days before, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> of the expedition party hunted through Old Town Creek area near the Old Shawnatown.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1945 the {{regiment}} loaded its tanks onto transporters {{and set off}} for Berlin {{to take part in}} the victory parade. The regiment was based at the Olympic Stadium in the newly designated British Sector. At the first opportunity and before orders were issued prohibiting such activities <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> fellow officers were able to borrow a jeep and explore the administrative heart of the capital. They visited the burnt out shell of the Reichstag first and then went on to the Reich Chancellery which was looted and severely damaged in the fighting but largely intact. In Adolf Hitler's study only his desk remained. They tried to gain access to the gardens at the rear but the Russians had placed a guard on it and forbade them exploring it. They were however, able to grab some souvenirs from the detritus in the building in the form of several small etchings and cards which contained Christmas greetings from the Führer.|$|E
25|$|Jewish settlers, {{primarily}} Sephardim, {{settled in}} New Orleans {{from the early}} nineteenth century. Some migrated from the communities established in the colonial years in Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia. The merchant Abraham Cohen Labatt helped found the first Jewish congregation in New Orleans in the 1830s, which {{became known as the}} Portuguese Jewish Nefutzot Yehudah congregation (<b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>some</b> other members were Sephardic Jews, whose ancestors had lived in Portugal and Spain). Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe immigrated in the late 19th and 20th centuries. By the 21st century, 10,000 Jews lived in New Orleans. This number dropped to 7,000 after Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans synagogues lost members, but most re-opened in their original locations. The exception was Congregation Beth Israel, the oldest and most prominent Orthodox synagogue in the New Orleans region. Beth Israel's building in Lakeview was destroyed by flooding. After seven years of holding services in temporary quarters, the congregation consecrated a new synagogue on land purchased from the Reform Congregation Gates of Prayer in Metairie.|$|E
