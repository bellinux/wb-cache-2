40|$|The {{generation}} of a temperature disturbance in a flow {{is accompanied by}} the production of acoustic waves (direct noise) and of an entropy perturbation. If this entropy perturbation is accelerated or decelerated (as is the case through a nozzle or flow restriction), additional acoustic waves are generated (<b>indirect</b> <b>noise).</b> Several studies have demonstrated this mechanism in controlled conditions by using entropy wave generators, in which entropy waves are generated and convected through a nozzle, leading to direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise.</b> An analytical analysis of the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> produced by the generation and acceleration of entropy waves in a reflective environment is presented. The effect of reverberation (repeated acoustic reflections) on low-frequency perturbations (characteristic of entropy wave generators) is determined analytically. These results are then implemented {{in a set of}} limit cases, showing the limit behaviours of such systems. The analytical model is applied to the case of the Cambridge entropy wave generator experiment, in which entropy waves are generated by an electric heater and accelerated through a subsonic orifice plate. Due to the clear time separation of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> in the experimental results, direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> transfer functions can be extracted from the experimental data {{for the first time and}} compared directly with existing theoretical models.

40|$|A {{previous}} investigation {{on the presence}} of direct and <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> for a full-scale turbofan engine using a far-field microphone at 130 is extended by also examining signals obtained at two additional downstream directions using far-field microphones at 110 deg and 160 deg. A generalized cross-correlation function technique is used to study the change in propagation time to the far field of the combined direct and <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> signal as a sequence of low-pass filters are applied. The filtering procedure used produces no phase distortion. As the low-pass filter frequency is decreased, the travel time increases because the relative amount of direct combustion noise is reduced. The <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> signal travels more slowly because in the combustor entropy fluctuations move with the flow velocity, which is slow compared to the local speed of sound. The <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> signal travels at acoustic velocities after reaching the turbine and being converted into an acoustic signal. The direct combustion noise is always propagating at acoustic velocities. The results show that the estimated <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> time delay values (post-combustion residence times) measured at each angle are fairly consistent with one another for a relevant range of operating conditions and demonstrate source separation of a mixture of direct and <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise.</b> The results may lead to a better idea about the acoustics in the combustor and may help develop and validate improved reduced-order physics-based methods for predicting turbofan engine core noise...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{waves in}} a {{combustor}} are generated from {{fluctuations in the}} heat release rate (direct noise) or the acceleration of entropy, vorticity or compositional perturbations through nozzles or turbine guide vanes (indirect or entropy noise). These sound waves are transmitted downstream as well as reflected upstream of the acceleration point, contributing to the overall noise emissions, or triggering combustion instabilities. Previous experiments attempted to isolate <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> by generating thermoacoustic hot spots electrically and measuring the transmitted acoustic waves, yet there are no measurements on the backward propagating entropy and acoustic waves. This work presents the first measurements which clearly separate the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> contributions to pressure fluctuations upstream of the acceleration point. Synthetic entropy spots are produced by unsteady electrical heating of a grid of thin wires located in a tube. Compression waves (direct noise) are generated from this heating process. The hot spots are then advected with the mean flow and finally accelerated through an orifice plate located {{at the end of}} the tube, producing a strong acoustic signature which propagates upstream (<b>indirect</b> <b>noise).</b> The convective time is selected to be longer than the heating pulse length, in order to obtain a clear time separation between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> in the overall pressure trace. The contribution of <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> to the overall noise is shown to be non-negligible either in subsonic or sonic throat conditions. However, the absolute amplitude of direct noise is larger than the corresponding fraction of <b>indirect</b> <b>noise,</b> explaining the difficulty in clearly identifying the two contributions when they are merged.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{combustion}} noise of aero-engines has gained in importance. Combustion noise consists of direct noise, {{related to the}} unsteady combustion process itself, and <b>indirect</b> <b>noise.</b> As known, entropy noise, contributing to <b>indirect</b> <b>noise,</b> is produced when entropy fluctuations originating from the combustor are accelerated through the turbine. According to the characterisation of a flow by pressure, entropy and vorticity perturbations, accelerated vorticity fluctuations are likewise expected to generate an <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> component. Within this work, the vortex sound generation mechanism was studied in a model experiment simplifying the combustor-turbine combination of aero-engines. Vorticity fluctuations were generated artificially by air-injection into swirl free as well as swirling tube flows and the proof of the emission of vortex sound during their acceleration in a convergent-divergent nozzle could be provided. The spatial and temporal change of the velocity field was determined with Hot-Wire Anemometry measurements upstream of the nozzle and the produced acoustic waves were detected downstream of it. For various flow fields imposed with perturbations the identification and separation of direct and vortex sound was achieved. Beside the dependency on the vorticity fluctuation amplitude, increasing the air-injection into the mean flow augments the vortex sound {{in case of a}} choked nozzle, the swirl intensity of the mean flow was figured out as a further parameter for this indirect sound generation process. In addition to the sound generation caused by the acceleration of a predominant, artificially produced vortex structure, the broadband noise emission of an accelerated tube flow was studied. With a linear theory approach, the alterations of the fluctuating velocity components through the acceleration were estimated.

This dissertation proposes a coupled approach based on the high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES) formalism that can take into account all the potential paths of interactions between components. In the first part of this work, an overset grid method is proposed to treat rotor/stator configurations in a rigorous fashion that is compatible with the LES solver AVBP. This interface treatment is shown not to impact the characteristics of the numerical schemes on a series of academic test cases of varying complexity. The approach is then validated on a realistic high-pressure turbine stage.

The second part of this work is dedicated to the prediction of combustion chamber-turbine interactions using the developed methodologies. The first type of interactions evaluated is the <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> generation across a high-pressure turbine stage.

The propagation models (Cumpsty and Marble, 1977 [3]) use the compact row hypothesis to write matching conditions between the inlet and the outlet of a turbine stage. Using numerical simulations, {{the validity of the}} analytical methods is studied and the errors made quantified...|$|E
40|$|Analytical and {{numerical}} {{assessments of}} the <b>indirect</b> <b>noise</b> generated through a noz-zle are presented. The configuration corresponds to an experimental setup operated at DLR by Bake et al. (2008) where an entropy wave is generated upstream of the nozzle {{by means of an}} electrical heating device. Both 3 -D and 2 -D axisymmetric simulations are performed to demonstrate that the experiment is mostly driven by linear acoustic phenomena, including pressure wave reflection at the outlet and entropy-to-acoustic con-version in the accelerated regions. On the other hand, the spatial inhomogeneity of the upstream entropy fluctuation has no visible effect for the frequency range investigated (0 - 100 Hz). Results show that the acoustic impedance downstream of the nozzle must be accounted for appropriately in order to recover the experimental pressure signal. A good agreement is also obtained with a purely analytical assessment based on the compact nozzle approximation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{push for}} higher {{performance}} analog/RF circuits in scaled CMOS necessitates self-healing via post-manufacturing tuning. A major challenge with self-healing systems is the efficient design of on-chip sensors that capture {{the performance of}} interest. This is particularly difficult for metrics such as phase noise that are not easily measured on-chip. We propose an indirect sensing method that exploits {{the correlations between the}} performance metrics of interest and those that can be measured using easy-to-integrate sensors. We demonstrate <b>indirect</b> phase <b>noise</b> sensing for a 25 GHz self-healing voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) design in 32 nm CMOS SOI that approaches the best parametric yield achievable based on simulated results. amplitude [3]. However, AAC does not completely solve the phase noise variability problem, as the phase noise does not correlate perfectly with amplitude. Control loop stability and the variations in the amplitude detectors also limit the efficacy of AAC. I...|$|R
40|$|The noise {{generation}} by accelerated vorticity waves in a nozzle flow {{was investigated in}} a model experiment. This {{noise generation}} mechanism belongs, besides entropy <b>noise,</b> to the <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise</b> phenomena. Vorticity as well as entropy fluctuations, originating from the highly turbulent combustion zone, are convected with the flow and produce noise during their acceleration in the outlet nozzle of the combustion chamber. In the model experiment, noise generation of accelerated vorticity fluctuations was achieved. The vorticity fluctuations in the tube flow were produced by injecting temporally additional air into the mean flow. As the next step, a parametric {{study was conducted to}} determine the major dependencies of the so called vortex noise. A quadratic dependency of the vortex noise on the injected air amount was found. In order to visualise and classify the artificially generated vorticity structures, planar velocity measurements have been conducted applying Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ...|$|R
40|$|In this program, a {{database}} of dynamic temperature and dynamic pressure measurements were acquired inside {{the core of a}} TECH 977 turbofan engine to support investigations of <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise.</b> Dynamic temperature and pressure measurements were recorded for engine gas dynamics up to temperatures of 3100 degrees Fahrenheit and transient responses as high as 1000 hertz. These measurements were made at the entrance of the high pressure turbine (HPT) and at the entrance and exit of the low pressure turbine (LPT). Measurements were made at two circumferential clocking positions. In the combustor and inter-turbine duct (ITD), measurements were made at two axial locations to enable the exploration of time delays. The dynamic temperature measurements were made using dual thin-wire thermocouple probes. The dynamic pressure measurements were made using semi-infinite probes. Prior to the engine test, a series of bench, oven, and combustor rig tests were conducted to characterize the performance of the dual wire temperature probes and to define and characterize the data acquisition systems. A measurement solution for acquiring dynamic temperature and pressure data on the engine was defined. A suite of hardware modifications were designed to incorporate the dynamic temperature and pressure instrumentation into the TECH 977 engine. In particular, a probe actuation system was developed to protect the delicate temperature probes during engine startup and transients in order to maximize sensor life. A set of temperature probes was procured and the TECH 977 engine was assembled with the suite of new and modified hardware. The engine was tested at four steady state operating speeds, with repeats. Dynamic pressure and temperature data were acquired at each condition for at least one minute. At the two highest power settings, temperature data could not be obtained at the forward probe locations since the mean temperatures exceeded the capability of the probes. The temperature data were processed using software that accounts for the effects of convective and conductive heat transfer. The software was developed under previous NASA sponsored programs. Compensated temperature spectra and compensated time histories corresponding to the dynamic temperature of the gas stream were generated. Auto-spectral and cross-spectral analyses of the data were performed to investigate spectral features, acoustic circumferential mode content, signal coherence, and time delays. The dynamic temperature data exhibit a wideband and fairly flat spectral content. The temperature spectra do not change substantially with operating speed. The pressure spectra in the combustor and ITD exhibit generally similar shapes and amplitudes, making it difficult to identify any features that suggest the presence of <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise.</b> Cross-spectral analysis reveal a strong correlation between pressure and temperature fluctuations in the ITD, but little correlation between temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the HPT and pressure fluctuations downstream of it. Temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the low pressure turbine were an order of magnitude smaller than those {{at the entrance to the}} high pressure turbine. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the combustor was inconclusive, perhaps due to the substantial mixing that occurs between the upstream and downstream locations. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the ITD indicate that they convect at the mean flow speed. Analysis of the data did not reveal any convincing indications of the presence of <b>indirect</b> combustion <b>noise.</b> However, this analysis has been preliminary and additional exploration of the data is recommended including the use of more sophisticated signal processing to explore subtle issues that have been revealed but which are not yet fully understood or explained...|$|R
