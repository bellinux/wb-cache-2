5|$|Cascioferro is {{considered}} to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on March 12, 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. The two men were very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|In a dance club, a {{young man}} is taken by a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
50|$|Lasse-Maja {{quickly became}} a notorious thief, {{stealing}} especially from rich people. His speciality was to dress in women's clothing so as to catch his victims off-guard (he sometimes flirted with the men) and to aid his escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>The</b> disguise was not used solely for professional reasons; he was also {{said to have been}} comfortable in women's clothes.|$|R
50|$|Police have searched 30,000 {{homes and}} interviewed 27,000 {{suspects}} over the attacks, {{at a cost}} of $4 million.

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Julie Loeb (Isabella Grace) {{is found}} shot dead during a hunting {{expedition}} in the woods. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), begin to examine Julie. Megan notices a scratch on Julie's husband Martin (Jay Karnes) beginning to suspect he is her killer. After interviewing Martin, her step children Thomas (Joey Adams) and Erika (Natalie Floyd), their financial manager Alan Wright (Alex Fernandez), and Martin's ex-wife Alexandra (Jessica Tuck), she accuses Martin of the murder. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) tells Megan that Martin has phoned the mayor, {{and made a}} complaint about Megan's behaviour who accused him of Julie's death. Megan is taken off the case, but gets Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) to test a tissue found on the scene. Kate defends her actions to Peter, stating {{that she did not}} take her off the case due to her grudge with Megan, as she is dating Megan's ex-husband Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling). Meanwhile, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) interviews people to become a driver; a person who carries the bodies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to the autopsy, and is ultimately unsuccessful. Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) interview Martin once again, but are interrupted by Megan, who gets back the results from the scratch, once again accusing Martin of fighting with Julie, which he denies, as his blood matched some which was on her fingernail. Kate issues a final warning to Megan, so Megan takes another case. Bud and Samantha interview Alan, and find out that Julie was pregnant when she was shot.|$|E

50|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> {{late 1990s}} {{to the early}} 2000s, a series of murders were {{committed}} in Louisiana. Eyewitness statements and FBI profiling indicated the perpetrator was likely a Caucasian male. After investigators tested DNA samples from thousands of Caucasian males and found no matches with DNA <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes,</b> DNA phenotyping was performed on a <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> DNA sample by DNAPrint Genomics. This testing indicated the ancestry of the suspect was 85% sub-Saharan African and 15% Caucasian, pointing to an African-American individual and changing {{the direction of the}} investigation. Within two months, police arrested Derrick Todd Lee, who was later convicted for two of these murders.|$|R

2500|$|Chikatilo was {{initially}} questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific {{questions regarding the}} murders, Chikatilo often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> victims, or to his retaining organs excised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> victims missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: [...] "I {{did not need to}} look for them.

40|$|AbstractFingerprints are {{the most}} affirmative source of {{personnel}} identification and are {{also one of the}} most ubiquitous evidences found at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> However, successful latent print recovery is not always possible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> especially when <b>the</b> prints have been exposed to destructive conditions. <b>Crime</b> <b>scenes</b> are often despoiled due to destructive conditions such as arson, explosion, exposure to drainage water and soil or snow burial. Moreover, the offender often intends to destroy the fingerprint bearing crucial evidence, using these destructive forces. Furthermore, the fingerprints exposed to despoiled <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> are generally neglected due to the misconception of impossible recovery. In the present study, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based fluorescent small particle reagents were formulated, compared and evaluated for the development of latent prints exposed to destructive conditions. Fresh latent prints and prints exposed to natural or simulated destructive <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> conditions, namely, arson, explosion, burial in soil, immersion in drainage water and burial in snow were developed using the three compositions. Latent prints were successfully recovered even <b>from</b> <b>the</b> destructive <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> simulations. Better quality prints were obtained from fresh prints, arson, soil burial and drainage water. Relatively poor results were obtained from explosion and snow burial conditions.

25|$|Police {{announced}} in January that the DNA {{from the scene}} had come back as belonging to a male. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and other evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had developed {{a profile of the}} man.

30|$|In {{forensic}} {{investigations and}} medico-legal practices, {{the determination of}} a person’s identity is the first {{and one of the}} most important tasks. Forensic analyses are usually performed by examining different parts of the body, like face, teeth, skull, and fingerprints. Routinely, fingerprints and palm prints are used by forensic officials for identification (Uthman et al., 2012). The reason is that a substantial amount of research has been conducted targeting the fingerprints and palm prints for human identification. Like fingerprints and palm prints, footprints are also widely recovered as pieces of evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> It is evident <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reported cases that culprits mostly remove their footwear to reduce the noise of walking, hence leaving their foot impressions at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> (Khan and Moorthy, 2013). Thus, the footprint analysis can provide a great help in the forensic investigations to identify the sex.|$|R
