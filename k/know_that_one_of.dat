25|$|In Time After Time, H.G. Wells invents a {{time machine}} and shows it to some friends {{in a manner similar}} to the first part of the novella. He does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which {{prevents}} the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|In 638, {{there was}} yet another {{incident}} where Wang, by then the minister of ceremonies, suggested that high-level officials {{should not have to}} yield to imperial princes when their processions meet. [...] Emperor Taizong initially saw this as an insult to the imperial princes—particularly Li Tai, whom he was secretly considering replacing Li Chengqian with—and he made the statement, [...] "Life is uncertain. [...] If the Crown Prince should die early, how do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the princes would not be your lord in the future. [...] How can you disrespect them?" [...] Wei, seeing what was happening, spoke bluntly, [...] "Ever since Zhou Dynasty, succession is always from father to son, not to brothers, to prevent plotting by younger sons and stop infighting at their origin. [...] This is what the rulers need to be careful about." [...] Emperor Taizong thereafter approved Wang's proposal.|$|E

60|$|Annie {{asked him}} to please to be more careful, for how did he <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{servants}} might not be sweeping the front porch, and of course, they would look in at the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, it {{is a kind}} of {{judicial}} Saturnalia. You must <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the requisites to be a macer, or officer in attendance upon our supreme court, is, that they shall be men of no knowledge.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{a letter}} from Jethro, is it?" [...] exclaimed Sam Price, {{overcome}} by a pardonable curiosity. For it was well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Jethro's fixed principles in life was embodied in his own motto, [...] "Don't write--send." ...|$|R
50|$|Although the Dreamwave Energon comic would {{discontinue}} after Dreamwave's bankruptcy, {{the writer}} of the comic, writer Simon Furman has let it be <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the stories if it had continued would be a 4-issue arc introducing Energon Omega Supreme.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the major}} factors that create hurricanes is warm water {{temperatures}} {{on the surface}} of the ocean. Evidence shows that dust from the Sahara desert caused surface temperatures to be cooler in 2006 than in 2005.|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment, your Excellency. This young officer, Lieutenant von Holtz, {{has treated}} us kindly and courteously. I {{want you to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your men, at least, has {{performed}} his duty {{in a way to}} merit our thanks--and yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is good to}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Keats's last pleasures was {{in hearing}} Severn read aloud from a volume of Jeremy Taylor. On first coming to Rome, he had bought a copy of Alfieri, but, finding on the second page these lines, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pray take a seat, Major--Major Clutterbuck," [...] said Mrs. Scully, {{referring}} to his card, which she still held in her very well-formed little hand. [...] "Major-general Scully, did you say? Dear me! I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my husband's relations went into the army, but we never heard what became of him. A major-general, is he? Whoever would have thought it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that you have been crammed with one side of the question, Mr. Brooke," [...] said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody, and was a Tory {{suspicious}} of electioneering intentions. [...] "You don't seem to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as chaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to supersede him." ...|$|E

"His {{father is}} a gentleman, and so is he, and in such times as are coming I should be glad to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my girls had such a {{protector}} as he would make her; but this is, as you said at first, almost ridiculous. He is {{two years older than}} she is, but in some respects she is the elder; he regards her as a pretty child, and all his thoughts are given to his studies and his sports.|$|E
50|$|With the {{announcement}} of a new national rugby union competition, it was <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the foundation clubs would be located in Perth - with three teams in New South Wales, two in Queensland and one each in Canberra and Melbourne making up the inaugural eight.|$|R
6000|$|The court <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Joan's {{purposes}} {{had been}} the deliverance of the exiled Duke of Orleans, and they were curious to know how she had intended to manage it.

5000|$|Stones {{fears were}} {{confirmed}} when on 4 January 1973 Australia's Immigration Ministry {{let it be}} <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Stones, unnamed, was banned from entering the country.

60|$|Various causes {{have been}} {{assigned}} for this manner of acting. Sir C. Bell maintains[13] that the chest is distended with air, and is kept distended at such times, {{in order to give}} a fixed support to the muscles which are thereto attached. Hence, as he remarks, when two men are engaged in a deadly contest, a terrible silence prevails, broken only by hard stifled breathing. There is silence, because to expel the air in the utterance of any sound would be to relax the support for the muscles of the arms. If an outcry is heard, supposing the struggle to take place in the dark, we at once <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two has given up in despair.|$|E

[...] Then, turning to me again, the spy continued, [...] "You will say to the marquis when you have speech with him, that I sent you, {{not being able to}} leave the village, as he can readily understand, and, after giving a description of the fortifications, say that much of the information has come through your friend, a little French boy, who seems to have a better idea of military works than a Jerseyman like myself. Let him <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his countrymen has been thus keen in finding out the plan." ...|$|E
60|$|What tortures {{of doubt}} {{and fear and}} {{uncertainty}} she must be suffering. He felt that his position was infinitely less terrible than hers, for he at least <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his loved <b>ones</b> was safe at home, while {{she had no idea}} of the whereabouts of either her husband or her son.|$|R
30|$|It is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{assumptions}} (A 1), (A 2), and (A 3) {{guarantees that}} the embedding W^ 1,t(R^N) L^r(R^N) is compact for each t< r< t^*=tN/N-t with 1 < t< N. As {{far as we}} know, there are few papers that deal with a general bounded potential case for problem (1.4).|$|R
50|$|In early 1564, Spanish {{governor}} Pedro de Villagra, {{was taking}} {{measures to protect}} all the towns and forts he already held against the growing Mapuche revolt and to organize a field army in Concepcion.

6000|$|... "I am cold, now I {{think of}} it. I {{did not notice}} it while I was {{watching}} the savages. When I took to the water again I did feel it. Maria will make me {{a cup of hot}} coffee, and then I shall be all right again. It was good fun to look at them, and know that they had no idea that I was so close. If I could have understood their language, I should have learned something worth telling. I felt inclined to scare them by giving a tremendous yell, and I know I could have got away all right. They were sitting round a big fire and {{would not have been able}} to see in the dark. I should have done it, only I thought Dias would have blamed me for letting them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us had come down the cañon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 17. The {{following}} Plate (+44+), {{representing a}} young shoot of independent ivy, {{just beginning to}} think it {{would like to get}} something to cling to, shows the way in which Nature brings subtle curvature into forms that at first seem rigid. The stems of the young leaves look nearly straight, and the sides of the projecting points, or bastions, of the leaves themselves nearly so; but on examination it will be found {{that there is not a}} stem nor a leaf-edge but is a portion of one infinite curve, if not of two or three. The main line of the supporting stem is a very lovely one; and the little half-opened leaves, in their thirteenth-century segmental simplicity (compare Fig. 9, Plate 8 in Vol. III.), singularly spirited and beautiful. It may, perhaps, interest the general reader to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the infinite curves derives its name from its supposed resemblance to the climbing of ivy up a tree.|$|E
60|$|It is no {{disparagement}} to Alric to say that, when {{he found}} himself suddenly {{face to face with}} this man, his mouth opened as wide as did his eyes, that the colour fled from his cheeks, that his heart fluttered like a bird in a cage, and that his lips and tongue became uncommonly dry! Well did the little fellow <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Danish vikings was before him, for many a time had he heard the men in Haldorstede describe their dress and arms minutely; and well did he know also that mercy was only to be purchased at the price of becoming an informer as to the state of affairs in Horlingdal--perhaps a guide to his father's house. Besides this, Alric had never up to that time beheld a real foe, even at a distance! He would have been more than mortal, therefore, had he shown no sign of trepidation.|$|E
50|$|Theodora is {{believed}} to have been born sometime around 1180/5 in Constantinople to parents whose identities are uncertain. However, it is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her grandmothers was a daughter of a Byzantine Emperor. As such, Theodora may have been a daughter of John Doukas (son of Andronikos Angelos) or else a daughter <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Andronikos' daughters.|$|R
30|$|It is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{challenging}} investigation areas for the biology and/or ecology population is the predator–prey interaction among the population. In the past few decades, many ecologists, mathematicians and biologists have paid attention to this field, especially for the persistence and/or extinction <b>of</b> <b>one</b> or more predator–predator interacting groups [8, 9, 23].|$|R
50|$|His father's {{name was}} Leo, and his mother's Zuna. It might be {{possible}} that the family was of Jewish descent which {{had been forced to}} convert to the Catholic faith.
