40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was conducted on B 2 C e-commerce companies or online retailers to study the challenges involved such as demand variations, reverse logistics, seasonal fluctuations, and stockless policy in inventory management and the risks such as lost sales, lost customers, low customer satisfaction associated with the same. This study also includes various strategies to mitigate the risk associated with <b>inventory</b> management <b>of</b> online retailers. The study revealed that online retailers are poised with myriad <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> management problems such as demand fluctuations, reverse logistics, stock outs, managing SKU's, <b>keeping</b> count <b>of</b> the <b>inventory,</b> multi channel shoppers, bottleneck and weak points, bullwhip effect and distressed stocks. To mitigate these risks online retailers adopted strategies such as dropship strategy, classification <b>of</b> <b>inventory,</b> hybrid strategy, pre-purchase stocks and stock less policy that is purchasing stocks after customer orders. The study also revealed that better inventory management {{plays an important role}} in enhancing customer satisfaction levels which in turn helps e-commerce companies in the long run...|$|R

30|$|Many {{controls}} {{had very}} low scores, such as CSC 17, which relates to staff awareness and training. Only eight forms asked about delivering security training and two forms asked about periodic testing. The first two {{in terms of}} priority CSC controls relate to <b>keeping</b> an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> authorised software and hardware; yet none of the forms contain any of the followings words: inventory, authorised, unauthorised, blacklist or whitelist. One UK firm asks for ‘approximate number of devices on network’; while this necessitates some form <b>of</b> crude <b>inventory,</b> it does not sufficiently address any of the sub-controls in CSC 1 : <b>Inventory</b> <b>of</b> Authorized and Unauthorized Devices.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the United States {{electric}} utility industry has migrated from a regulated to a deregulated business environment. As a result, utilities {{in the electric}} power sector face a much more urgent imperative to emphasize cost efficiencies {{as compared to the}} days of regulation. One major opportunity for cost savings is through reductions in spare parts inventory. Most utilities are accustomed to carrying large volumes of expensive, relatively slow-moving units because of a high degree of risk-averseness. In this paper we discuss the tradeoffs associated with <b>keeping</b> large amounts <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> versus the potential revenue losses if a plant were to go off-line.

40|$|The {{just-in-time}} concept decrees not {{to accept}} ordered goods before their due dates {{in order to avoid}} inventory cost. This bounces the inventory cost back to the manufacturer: products that are completed before their due dates have to be stored. Reducing this type of storage cost by preclusion of early completion conflicts with the traditional policy <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> work-in-process <b>inventories</b> down. This paper addresses a single-machine scheduling problem with the objective <b>of</b> minimizing total <b>inventory</b> cost, comprising cost associated with work-in-process inventories and storage cost as a result of early completion. The cost components are measured by the sum of the job completion times and the sum of the job earlinesses. This problem differs from more traditional scheduling problems, since the insertion of machine idle time may reduce total cost. The search for an optimal schedule, however, can be limited to the set of job sequences, since for any sequence there is a clear-cut way to insert machine idle time in order to minimize total inventory cost. We apply branch-and-bound to identify an optimal schedule. We present five approaches for lower bound calculation, based upon relaxation of the objective function, of the state space, and upon Lagrangian relaxation. Key Words and Phrases: just-in-time manufacturing, inventory cost, work-in-process inventory, earliness, tardiness, machine idle time, branch-and-bound algorithm, Lagrangian relaxation...|$|R

40|$|In today’smanufacturing climate {{there is}} an {{increased}} focus {{on the use of}} the principles that form the foundation for the Lean manufacturing philosophy to create efficient and effective companies. Within Lean there is a great focus on identifying and eliminating waste. One of the seven wastes that Lean thinking strives to eliminate is the <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> unnecessary <b>inventory.</b> The purpose ofthis study is to discover areas of improvement in a production flow and to give suggestions on these through finding and eliminating waste in the production environment. The production flow has been mapped using value stream mapping and has been analyzed accordingly. The specific production flow that has been mapped is located to a plant in the southern parts of Sweden and is operating within the plastic industry. At this plant, a specific product family has been mapped from raw material to shipment. In parallel with the empirical work literature studies have been conducted. The literature studies have sought to create a theoretical support for the result of the study. The current state at the factory has been mapped to create an understanding for the authors and the reader but also to give the study credibility with the company.  At the company observations and interviews have been conducted, mainly within two areas; the extrusion and the conversion into sheets. In addition to this thorough observations and calculations <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> levels have been made, mainly in the semi-finished goods inventory. As the current state has been mapped thoroughly an analysis of the value stream has been conducted. Two areas have been focused upon in the analysis; the semi-finished goods inventory and the sheeting process. The observations and the analysis have shown disorganization in the inventory which causes materialto be forgotten and obsolete. In the sheeting process the analysis has shown that the lack of work instructions leads to variations in the cycle time and to variations in the mode of work. The inconsistency in the way work is conducted makes it difficult to obtain a common standard on quality. The analysis has resulted in an action plan which will lead to improvements in the production flow. In connection to this a future state map has been developed illustrating the desired state. The points of action are focused on the semi-finished goods inventory and the sheeting process. The major changes are the implementation of a FIFO-lane to increase the structure in the inventory and the development of work instructions for the sheeting process. The method used has been discussed and also the results obtained in the study and the compliance of the results with the purpose and thesis questions have been discussed. The study has also lead to suggestions for further studies that the company should investigate...|$|R
