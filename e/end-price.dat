40|$|Online auction {{has become}} a very popular {{e-commerce}} transaction type. The immense business opportunities attract a lot of individuals as well as online stores. With more sellers engaged in, the competition between sellers is more intense. For sellers, how to maximize their profit by proper auction setting becomes the critical success factor in online auction market. In this paper, we provide a selling recommendation service which can predict the expected profit before listing and, based on the expected profit, recommend the seller whether to use current auction setting or not. We collect data from five kinds of digital camera from eBay and apply machine learning algorithm to predict sold probability and <b>end-price.</b> In order to get genuine sold probability and <b>end-price</b> prediction (even for unsold items), we apply probability calibration and sample selection bias correction when building the prediction models. To decide whether to list a commodity or not, we apply cost-sensitive analysis {{to decide whether to}} use current auction setting. We compare the profits using three different approaches: probability-based, <b>end-price</b> based, and our expected-profit based recommendation service. The experiment result shows that our recommendation service based on expected profit gives higher earnings and probability is a key factor that maintains the profit gain when ultra cost incurs for unsold items due to stocking...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{process of}} electricity market liberalization, and concentrates on one phase - unbundling. First part sums up findings on electricity market liberalization, and explains unbundling principles, initial situation and expected outcome. In {{the second part}} unbundling costs are analyzed and in the third part, fulfillment of unbundling targets and its contribution to improve end-customer's position are assessed. The authors arrived to conclusion that unbundling contributed to decrease electricity <b>end-price</b> for households in the 2005 - 2008 period, despite substantial unbundling costs. However other factors, such as demand increase and electricity price convergence between the Czech Republic and Germany, were much stronger and caused substantial electricity price increase in the examined period.

40|$|Online auctions are {{generating}} {{a new class}} of fine-grained data about online transactions. This data lends itself to a variety of applications and services that can be provided to both buyers and sellers in online marketplaces. We collect data from online auctions and use several classification algorithms to predict the probable-end prices of online auction items. This paper describes the feature extraction and selection process, and several machine learning formulations of the price prediction problem. As a prototype application, we developed Auction Price Insurance that uses the predicted <b>end-price</b> to offer price insurance to sellers in online auctions. We define Price Insurance as a service that offers insurance to auction sellers that guarantees a price for their goods, for an appropriate premium. If the item sells for less than the insured price, the seller is reimbursed for the difference. We show that our price prediction techniques are accurate enough to offer price insurance as a profitable business. While this paper deals specifically with online auctions, we believe that this is an interesting case study that applies to dynamic markets where the price of the goods is variable and is affected by both internal and external factors that change over time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Online auctions {{have become}} {{one of the fastest growing}} modes of onlinecommerce transactions. eBay has 94 million active members buying and selling goods at a {{staggering}} rate. These auctions are also producing large amounts of data that can be utilized to provide services to the buyers and sellers, market research, and product development. We collect historical auction data from eBay and use machine learning algorithms to predict <b>end-prices</b> of auction items. We describe the features used, and several formulations of the price prediction problem. Using the PDA category from eBay, we show that our algorithms are extremely accurate and can result in a useful set of services for buyers and sellers in online marketplaces. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} moderating {{role of the}} extension direction on the fit-extension relationship in a vertical extension context. Existing brand extension knowledge suggests that as fit increases, risk decreases, resulting in better extension evaluations. However, there is a gap in our knowledge of how this effect behaves in a vertical line extension context. In contrast to the existing brand extension literature, this research shows that fit has an asymmetrical effect on evaluations of vertical extensions; an effect is found for upscale but not downscale extensions. The asymmetry suggested here {{is a consequence of}} the moderating effect of the extension direction on the two independent variables, fit and brand expertise. It is shown that for upscale extensions, fit is used as a risk reduction mechanism while brand expertise plays that role for downscale extensions. Further, this thesis investigates a different proxy for fit perception. Examining the role of the parent brand price range on fit perceptions, it is shown that consumer evaluations of extensions are more consistent with range theory than adaptation-level theory predictions about consumers’ contextual reference price processing. In particular, it is demonstrated that the parent brand price range rather than its mean, or a single anchor (e. g. <b>end-prices),</b> influences consumer perceptions of the new extension product. And because fit has no effect on downscale scenarios, judgments of the new downscale extension are made regardless of the parent brand price mean or range width. In contrast, upscale extensions derived from parent brands with wide price portfolios tend to be more similar and thus are more positively evaluated than those derived from brand with a narrow vertical price structure. This thesis defines and measures perceived fit from a feature-based perspective. The rationale for this approach relies on a particular characteristic of vertical extensions: new products are extended within the same product line as the parent brand but at a higher or lower price/quality point than current offerings of the parent brand. Hence, price and quality are the two attributes that receive the most weight when determining the fit between parent brand and extension. Further, fit is also measured from a relative perspective that takes into account the parent brand price range as an antecedent of fit. Experimental research was conducted to test the hypotheses outlined in this thesis. Six web-experiments were conducted using MTurk’s platform for respondent sampling. The first three studies demonstrate that consumers systematically use perceived fit as a risk reduction mechanism for upscale extensions while perceived brand expertise is the mechanism for downscale extensions. These studies reveal that risk perceptions are lower for downscale extensions than for upscale extensions because it is the effect of brand expertise on the extension evaluation that is mediated by perceived risk in the downscale setting while the effect of perceived fit on the extension evaluation is mediated by perceived risk in upscale scenarios. In addition, the latter three studies show that respondents systematically used the parent brand price range rather than a single anchor (either the mean or end prices) to make judgments about the new extension product. Importantly, results from the first three studies are replicated in a different fit manipulation and it is shown that an effect exists in upscale but not in downscale scenarios. This research adds to the literature by showing that the assumption that improvements of fit, decreases risk, resulting in better extension evaluations is replicated only for an upscale setting. Conversely, in the downscale scenario, it is the effect of brand expertise on extension evaluations, rather than fit, that is mediated by perceived risk. Further, this thesis extends the use of range-theory to a vertical extension context by showing that consumers do not rely on a single price anchor (mean prices or end prices) to make judgments of a new product. Rather, it demonstrates that all contextual price information can influence how consumers rate new products. It adds to the literature by showing that consumer perception of similarity in a vertical extension context is a relative construct that can be affected by the firm’s framing of its product line. By using vertical price differentiation, brands can improve their perceptions of fit for upscale extensions. This is particularly important for mainstream brands trying to introduce higher priced segments. Lastly, the research presented in this thesis has direct implications for marketers hoping to successfully leverage their product line by introducing vertical extensions. If the effects of fit are diminished by the extension direction, then the extendibility of brands is different than previously thought. This thesis shows that if companies want to move their brands to the higher end of the market they should take small steps, slowly increasing perceptions of brand expertise. The introduction of a product that is far from their current price range is likely to be viewed with scepticism by consumers, who may see the purchase as too risky. But {{this is not the case}} for downscale extensions where new product evaluations are made regardless of fit. ...|$|R
