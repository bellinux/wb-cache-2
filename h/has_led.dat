5|$|In several locations, traffic {{congestion}} along Route32 <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to suggestions {{to change or}} modify the road. The problems are most severe at the southern terminus, {{but it is not}} the only section of the road with issues.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E

50|$|Selective {{breeding}} for dog breeds caused constricting breed-specific bottlenecks. These bottlenecks <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to dogs <b>having</b> {{an average}} of 2-3% more genetic loading than gray wolves. The strict breeding programs and population bottlenecks <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the prevalence of diseases such as heart disease, blindness, cancers, hip dysplasia, cataracts, and more.|$|R
