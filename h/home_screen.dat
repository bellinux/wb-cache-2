50|$|Although most <b>home</b> <b>screens</b> have {{a similar}} structure, not all are {{designed}} in common. Two notable examples of less-common <b>home</b> <b>screens</b> paradigms include Siri and WebOS. The former is Apple's natural language user interface, which performs functions similar to more traditional <b>home</b> <b>screens</b> such as opening applications, displaying relevant data, and managing phone settings. The latter is notable for its use of entirely dynamic application icons that mimic {{the current state of}} the application, similar to task managers on other mobile operating systems.|$|R

5000|$|The S II {{employs the}} TouchWiz 4.0 user interface, {{following}} the same principle as TouchWiz 3.0 found on the Galaxy S, with new improvements, such as hardware acceleration.

[...] "Panning" [...] on TouchWiz 4.0 allows the movement of widgets and icons shortcuts between screens, by allowing the device to be held and moved from side to side to scroll through <b>home</b> <b>screens.</b> This gesture-based management of widgets is a new optional method next to the existing method of holding and swiping between <b>home</b> <b>screens.</b> The Android 4.1 update backports the TouchWiz Nature interface and other features from the Galaxy S III, such as Direct Call, Pop-up Play, Smart Stay, and Easy Mode.|$|R
50|$|Though {{it may be}} of {{interest}} to clinicians and social workers, the variety of reasons why non-maltreating parenting may be associated with infant disorganized/disoriented attachment is an important reason why it is not appropriate to use disorganized attachment as a screening tool for abuse.
