2500|$|The Mikado {{has been}} admired by other composers. Dame Ethel Smyth wrote of Sullivan, [...] "One day he {{presented}} {{me with a}} copy of the full score of The Golden Legend, adding: 'I think this is the best thing I've done, don't you?' and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion The Mikado is his masterpiece, he cried out: 'O you wretch!' But though he laughed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>he</b> followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E

60|$|Miller was shaken. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that. <b>He</b> sat {{like one}} who has been dealt a {{stunning}} blow.|$|R
60|$|Later {{in the day}} {{he came to me}} again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> {{had made}} no fresh discovery.|$|R
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> had something special." ...|$|E
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|E
60|$|Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was agitated. His {{face grew}} white at once.|$|E
60|$|I {{wished that}} his face were visible so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> if <b>he</b> still smiled when he uttered those words.|$|R
60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was not very much pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! Me, of {{all people}} in the world!" [...] he {{repeated}} portentously. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was frightened. Such want of tact! ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was in one of}} his moods.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very intently to see if I were mocking. He laughed. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was very much moved.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was working}} rapidly with his hands. When he {{returned}} to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|R
60|$|His {{face grew}} a trifle more animated; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was recovering. The dumb stupor which had held his {{features}} rigid was passing away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> as <b>he</b> {{looked down}} {{that he was}} {{repressing}} some internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Henry {{was in the}} steward's room, {{affecting}} employment, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was only}} impatient to hear of my errand.|$|E
60|$|He {{never looked}} up, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was getting excited under his dejection. He slapped the bench with his open palm.|$|E
60|$|Harmmed was the butler. When {{he entered}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was labouring under {{controlled}} excitement. He came {{at once to}} the point.|$|E
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was relieved. I {{think he}} had expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was interested, and I {{knew that}} as I spoke {{he had looked}} {{through the window and}} seen the man writing the letter.|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} table. As I had expected, de Cartienne was {{watching}} us, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was straining every nerve to overhear our conversation.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was not at}} ease, so I {{took his}} poor old {{wrinkled}} hand in mine {{and asked him to}} speak fully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{positively}} refuse?" [...] he asked, wistfully, drawing back. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{stood in}} a certain dread of that imperious little woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so," [...] said Sidney absently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> wasn't {{thinking}} of me at all. I {{wondered if he}} were {{thinking of}} Mrs. Rennie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, {{laying down}} his cup, [...] "I feared as much. How was it done?" [...] He spoke calmly, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was deeply moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{looked upon}} him <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> spoke words of truth. The light {{in his eye}} {{told me that he}} was indeed beyond the power of the elixir.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He didn't {{say much}} to me, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what <b>he</b> thought. And of course {{everybody}} thinks the same. How you can {{like the people}} yourself is what I can't understand!' ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{had heard}} all, Jodd, {{although}} he was a hopeful-minded man, grew sad over this journey, which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> thought would be my last.|$|E
60|$|He raised {{himself on}} his arms and crawled in with difficulty. His legs dragged after him. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was in great pain. But still, he managed it.|$|E
60|$|Now at this Laban grew angry, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was {{prone to}} do, and {{stretched}} out his hand as though to push Seti aside and seize Merapi.|$|E
6000|$|... "And if {{he seeks}} an {{interview}} with me, I shall decline it." [...] He looked at me defiantly and yet interrogatively. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was very angry, and yet uncertain.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. He {{looked all}} round. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> {{was making a}} great effort. The spirit of Paris battled against his better nature. He was tempted, but he didn't fall.|$|R
60|$|One day {{he came to}} me as I {{was sitting}} in the club, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> had had an idea. He looked happier than he had done in weeks.|$|R
