40|$|The need {{to build}} next {{generation}} air force systems with highly complex functions, but at rela-tively low cost, will inevitably means a major investment in software. Without highly reliable software, any ambitious air force program cannot succeed. Indeed, software is the keystone (or perhaps the Achilles heel) of most large-scale automation projects; {{and the problem of}} making software reliable has become one of today's most important technological challenges. To address this problem and to improve software reliability, we designed novel program analy-sis techniques that significantly speed up software model checking, thereby enabling the check-ing of much larger programs and broader class of program properties than previously possible. In particular, we developed a software model checker for efficiently checking <b>data</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>programs</b> with respect to complex data dependent properties. We used our model checker for checking programs that use linked data structures such as lists, queues, trees, and maps. Veri-fying such programs has often been an obstacle to progress in the past and is a key underlying technical challenge in software verification. Because these programs have complex data depen-dent properties, the state space reduction techniques (such as predicate abstraction or partial order reduction) used by other model checkers are largely ineffective on such programs. Our model checker uses novel techniques to achieve orders of magnitude state space reduction. In addition, we also developed a novel trace driven approach to use counter example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) to check for concurrency errors in multithreaded programs...|$|R

40|$|Natural systems, {{that are}} systems from nature, {{represent}} a potential source for new algorithms and/or {{applications in the}} technology; however, an investigation of these systems is necessary, {{in order to measure}} the consequences of interferences. For the investigation of natural systems, multi-agent technology based simulation tools are used to lower the entrance threshold, and to thus reach an extended group of users. The simulation model of available tools can be improved to promote system thinking in the context of school application. In the context of this thesis, firstly a state-based object model is developed, which allows a simpler transformation of existing biological models into simulation models. Further, the state-based object model permits the user a simpler change of the object behavior by super-ordinate structuring, as well as the reduction of the administration efforts. Object programming takes place by means of an object-orientated-flow programming language, similar to a data flow programming. The implementation of control structures, difficult to represent in <b>data</b> flow <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> languages, is realized in a simple manner using the developed state-based object model. The programming model was implemented prototypically in form of a visual programming language and environment, using special visualization techniques...|$|R

In this project we discuss the main characteristics of Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> (AOP) with a particular focus on distributed systems. Our experiments {{support the hypothesis that}} the use of Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> will result in a better separation of concerns and thus in better maintainability and portability of such systems (in comparison with a classical object <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> development approach). Classical object <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> is not allowing the separation of concerns but here in aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> is allowing the separation of cross cutting concerns. Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> (AOP) is a programming paradigm that increases modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. Separation of concerns leads to breaking down a paradigm into distinct parts called concerns. We focus mainly, in this project, is designing the Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> with a particular focus on distributed application. The use of Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>program</b> will result in a better separation of concerns and thus in better maintainability and portability of distributed applications...|$|R

For this purpose we define a direct denotational semantics of a small object <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> language.

40|$|Computer {{programming}} paradigms aim {{to provide}} better separation of concerns. Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> extends object <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> by managing crosscutting concerns using aspects. AspectJ {{is the most}} successful aspect oriented implementation. It extends the Java programming language with constructs specific to aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming.</b> Two {{of the most important}} critics of aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> and AspectJ are the “tyranny of the dominant signature ” and lack of visibility of program's flow. Metadata, in form of Java annotations, is a solution to both problems. Design patterns are the embodiments of best practices in object oriented design. Aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> can be used to implement the most known patterns, the “Gof ” patterns, in order to analyze the benefits. This thesis presents the results of using aspect <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> and metadata to implement the “Gof ” patterns. The most successful implementations are the ones in which the pattern-related code crosscuts across the concerns encapsulated in the participants in the pattern. Successful implementations share a generic solution: the usage of annotation to configure and mark the participants, while the pattern's code is encapsulated in aspects. This looses the coupling between aspects and type signatures and between the code base and a specific AOP framework. Also, it increases the developer's awareness of the program's flow. The patterns are plugged/unplugged based on the presence/absence of annotations...|$|R

40|$|Aliasing is endemic in object <b>oriented</b> <b>programming.</b> Because {{an object}} can be {{modified}} via any alias, object <b>oriented</b> <b>programs</b> are hard to understand, maintain, and analyse. Flexible alias protection is a conceptual model of inter-object relationships which limits the visibility of changes via aliases, allowing objects to be aliased but mitigating the undesirable e#ects of aliasing. Flexible alias protection can be checked statically using programmer supplied aliasing modes and imposes no runtime overhead. Using flexible alias protection, programs can incorporate mutable objects, immutable values, and updatable collections of shared objects, in a natural object <b>oriented</b> <b>programming</b> style, while avoiding the problems caused by aliasing. 1 Introduction I am who I am; I will be who I will be.
