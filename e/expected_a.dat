5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care costs, less than the prior year's survey had <b>expected.</b> <b>A</b> 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E

5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E

During his speech, McDowell was interrupted {{by members of the}} Ancient Order of Hibernians opposed to the Government plans.|$|E

On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E

The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.|$|E

Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech {{to improve on}} its previous performance. Most commentators, however, <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> season comparable to 1994's: a second-place finish in the Big East {{and a trip to}} the Gator Bowl. This was borne out by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E

5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E

He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw {{threatened}} Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E
5|$|As they {{approach}} the planet, Jameson begins audio communication with Karnas to learn more of the situation, but soon discovers that it is Karnas himself that has taken the Federation staff. Karnas reminds Jameson that his treachery during their last encounter on Mordan IV resulted in years of war. Against the advice of Picard, Jameson devises plans to rescue the hostages by transporting the away team, now including the captain, to the tunnels beneath Karnas' mansion, where Jameson believes the hostages are being held. Picard privately confronts Jameson about Karnas' motives. Jameson reveals that in the past, Karnas had captured a Federation starliner in revenge {{for the death of}} his father by another local tribe. Jameson had negotiated for the passengers' release by giving Karnas what he demanded, a supply of Federation weapons. However, Jameson, in his interpretation of the Prime Directive, also supplied the warring tribes with an equal number of weapons. Jameson had thought this would only lead to a short-lived skirmish, and had not <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> war that would last over forty years. Jameson is now insistent on correcting his past mistake and thus took the reverse aging drug in order to be at his best.|$|E

In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British {{did not appear to}} trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|Brazil defender and captain Thiago Silva was {{suspended}} for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, despite an appeal against the suspension by the Brazilian Football Confederation. Forward Neymar was also unavailable for the match, having been sidelined {{for the rest of}} the tournament after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final match against Colombia. Dante and Bernard, making their first starts of the tournament, replaced Thiago Silva and Neymar respectively with Luiz Gustavo replacing Paulinho in defensive midfield. Germany were unchanged from their quarter-final. Goalkeeper Júlio César and stand-in captain David Luiz paid tribute to Neymar by holding his shirt during the national anthem ceremony. Even with the absences, analysts <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> close match, feeling the home crowd could provide an advantage.|$|E
5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.|$|E
