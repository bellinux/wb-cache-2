25|$|Regarding {{the debate}} {{about the role of the}} liberal {{democratic}} model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. <b>Institutional</b> <b>change</b> is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{results from}} various studies {{reflect the fact}} that {{endogenous}} regulations and other different rules yield distinct effects on income inequality. A study examines the effects of <b>institutional</b> <b>change</b> on age-based labor market inequalities in Europe. There is a focus on wage-setting institutions on the adult male population and the rate of their unequal income distribution. According to the study, there is evidence that unemployment protection and temporary work regulation affect the dynamics of age-based inequality with positive employment effects of all individuals by the strength of unions. Even though the European Union is within a favorable economic context with perspectives of growth and development, it is also very fragile.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{interaction}} between political and economic institutions is further reinforced by Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson in The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, <b>Institutional</b> <b>Change,</b> and Economic Growth', which covers the economic rise of Europe after 1500. The paper finds that the Atlantic Trade (slavery, commodities and so on) after the year 1500 increased profits from trade and thus created a merchant class that {{was in a position}} to challenge monarchical power. By conducting regression analysis on the interaction variable between institution type and the Atlantic trade, the paper also demonstrates a significant interaction between the Atlantic Trade and the political institution: the presence of an absolutist monarch power hampers the effect of the Atlantic Trade on economic rise. It explains why Spain, despite the same access to the Atlantic Trade fell behind England in economic development.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{question}} {{the idea of}} international interventions at all. In a 2005 working paper for the Center for Global Development, Jeremy Weinstein of Stanford University provides a theory of “autonomous recovery,” in which states can achieve sustainable peace without international intervention. Using case studies of Uganda, Eritrea, and Somalia, Weinstein demonstrates how states can develop effective institutions out of warfare. This method has cost and benefits that must be weighed against the potential outcome of international intervention. External intervention can stop mass atrocities, but also stop <b>institutional</b> <b>change.</b> Autonomous recovery elevates the strongest leader, but also rewards the strongest fighters who may be less inclined to share power. Furthermore, intervention depends on external influence while autonomous recovery is based on internal factors. The conclusions of his argument could suggest intervention is not ideal policy, but Weinstein argues the international community’s “responsibility to protect” doctrine has moral importance for intervention and the conditions for “autonomous recovery” are very rare. Weinstein argues the fundamental challenge is how to incentivise good governance and assistance to rebel groups without disrupting the connection of citizens to rulers in terms of revenue collection that enables accountability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} market liberalization on firm performance through <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> during the economic reform in China. The conceptualization focuses on the decentralization of control, ownership restructuring, and industrial policy as the primary <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> to implement market liberalization in China. These <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> affect firm performance by shaping managerial incentives, affecting transaction and agency costs, and making selective resource allocations across and within industries. Using a large-scale data set including 23, 577 firms between 1992 and 1996, the study examines how market liberalization affects the profitability and productivity of Chinese firms {{and the relationship between}} ownership change and the performance of state-owned enterprises. © 2006 Academy of International Business All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
500|$|In April 1990 Mobutu {{announced}} he would accommodate multi-party politics. Lihau, {{who was at the}} time presiding over a meeting of exiled politicians in Brussels, demanded that before opposition elements return to the country Mobutu's government guarantee the tolerance of a genuine multi-party system, agree to organise a round table conference for political reconciliation, and begin disbanding state security forces. Lihau did eventually return to the Congo. Once there, he joined the UDPS in endorsing the formation of a [...] "Conference Nationale Souveraine" [...] to discuss political reform in the country. One soon convened, but Lihau protested the large number of delegates summoned by Mobotu to participate, accusing him of trying to stack the representation in his own favor. Throughout the conference's existence Lihau chaired its constitutional commission. At one point during the conference, Lihau denounced the perceived Baluba dominance of the UDPS and joined the Alliance des Bangala, a party with financial support from Mobutu that promoted politicians from Équateur. Eventually the constitutional commission produced a draft recommendation of a federal system that was intended to maintain the national integrity of the Congo while respecting its diversity. The conference disbanded in December 1992 having greatly reinvigorated democratic thought in the country but ultimately failing to enact significant <b>institutional</b> <b>change.</b> Lihau went back to the United States to receive medical treatment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the strategic {{response of the}} Indian pharmaceutical industry to the dual <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> arising from economic liberalization of the Indian economy and the WTO mandated intellectual property regime. An analysis of the relative position and growth of Indian firms vis-à-vis foreign multinationals, changes in the resources and capabilities of these firms, and scope in terms of product market internationalization and overseas acquisitions during the 1995 - 2005 period, suggests an 'indigenous growth' model in the Indian pharmaceutical industry which {{is in contrast to}} the FDI initiated growth witnessed through full or partial privatization of state-owned firms in other geographical contexts. Second, internationalization of both inputs and product markets has been the dominant mode to overcome the pressures arising from <b>institutional</b> <b>changes.</b> We discuss the drivers of this model and provide implications for future research on strategic responses to <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> within other industries in India as well as for comparative research across different political and institutional settings.

30|$|The {{investigation}} of {{the first question is}} mainly to achieve {{a better understanding of how}} to plan <b>institutional</b> <b>changes.</b> Developing an innovation system is not merely about how to manipulate the relations of academia, industry and government for technology innovation, but is also a matter of adjusting the institutional environment or institutional innovation. Therefore, to successfully construct China as an innovative country it is about how China can manage <b>institutional</b> <b>changes.</b> Designing and making <b>institutional</b> <b>changes</b> is very complex and complicated. Among many other things, the starting point is to know what needs to change and how possibly to achieve this. In this regard, few studies and discussions exist in China. This study is indeed an attempt in that direction, but is rather preliminary.|$|R
2500|$|While {{disruptive}} innovation will typically [...] "attack a traditional business {{model with a}} lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly," [...] foundational innovation is slower, and typically {{has the potential to}} create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and <b>institutional</b> <b>change</b> that gain momentum more slowly. [...] The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email), and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s {{with the advent of the}} World Wide Web—is a foundational technology.|$|E

A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally {{suggested}} acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration building (1952) and ending with Wean Hall (1971) saw the <b>institutional</b> <b>change</b> from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the University's growing national reputation in artificial intelligence, business, robotics and the arts. In addition, an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park. A ravine long known as [...] "The Cut" [...] was gradually filled in to campus level, joining [...] "the Mall" [...] as a major campus open space.|$|E
2500|$|The European {{countries}} of Norway and Sweden are provided as additional {{examples of the}} new managerialism in tertiary education. [...] Noting that the countries do differ in their approaches to <b>institutional</b> <b>change</b> from that in the United Kingdom, these examples illustrate that {{the changes in the}} governance of European higher education “can be interpreted differently in varying contexts”. [...] In both Norway and Sweden, each have emphasized restructuring based on in vogue international trends with different approaches to reform that are characterized as common to continental Europe. [...] New organizational forms for governance and leadership with the diversification of higher education have emphasized maintaining institutional autonomy, harmonizing institutional standards, and expanding higher education with goals related to the neoliberal market model of education. [...] Stressing quality of learning and leadership within higher education, restructuring by way of the key catchphrases such as accountability, changing management in Europe also includes providing for human resource goals such as staff development.|$|E
