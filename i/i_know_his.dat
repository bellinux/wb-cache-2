500|$|In {{the days}} before the game was to be played there was {{significant}} coverage given to the two head coaches Smith and Thompson. The two had both served as coaches on the 1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. The two coaches first met in Washington D.C. while trying to recruit players from the same high school. Thompson was quoted saying that coach Smith [...] "knows our philosophy and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> philosophy." [...] Smith talked of Thompson saying he was a personal friend of his and that he would maintain contact with him whether or not Thompson was still coaching.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} on their official website that Drogba completed {{his return to}} the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract. Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said: [...] "It was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with José Mourinho again. Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.|$|E
2500|$|Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones {{said of the}} appointment: [...] "Raj isn’t only a {{personal}} friend to me but also to Wales. He’s been a tireless advocate for promoting our country {{as a place to}} invest and do business and travelled with me to India earlier this year to highlight what we have to offer to Indian companies. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> appointment as Honorary Consul to Wales will be of great pride to him and I am sure he will do an excellent job." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not to}} be concealed, nor was it so {{doubtful}} as {{to leave}} me any room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire husband. I was frightened to death; I never was in such a consternation in my life; I though I should have sunk into the ground; my blood ran chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of ague. I say, there was no room to question the truth of it; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> clothes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> horse, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
60|$|This was translated, and {{the lawyer}} asked how <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> trade.|$|R

2500|$|An FBI {{recording}} of Black's hotel suite in April 1963 recorded him saying of Levinson to columnist Jack Anderson, [...] "Jack, some day when Eddie comes here for dinner or something, I {{want you to}} meet him. He's a little hard to describe. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> whole background. He was probably the biggest bookmaker Detroit ever had. I know he was the biggest gambler Miami ever had. Then he went to Las Vegas. He came under the granddaddy law; it excused him for anything he ever did as long as he stayed working in Nevada. He told us all those things." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War I, Baird {{volunteered to}} {{construct}} cantonments for the U.S. Army to house 20,000 to 30,000 men. [...] In November 1918, {{at the end}} of hostilities, Baird applied for a passport to travel to France and Belgium to represent the Fuller Company in selling building materials {{to be used in the}} post-war reconstruction efforts. [...] Bernard Baruch, Chairman of the War Industries Board, wrote a letter in support of Baird's application in which he stated:"This is to certify that I know Mr. James Baird personally and have known him practically all my life, and that I know him to be an American born citizen born in Vanceburg, Ky. about 45 years ago. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> father also, an American citizen born in America." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of Moissan, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> artificial diamonds were very small. I shook my head.|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> name, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> note, [...] That so with rapture {{takes my}} soul; [...] Like flame the gold beneath his throat, [...] His glossy cope is black as coal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said St. Just, {{and much}} {{against his will}} a slight shudder ran through his slim figure as he spoke. [...] "Foucquier-Tinville I know; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> cunning, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> power--but the other?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} such a lark. Two or three times I {{have been to the}} 'Hollies'; to socialist meetings. Leslie does not know. They are great fun. Of course, I am in sympathy with the socialists, but I cannot narrow my eyes till I see one thing only. Life is like a large, rather {{beautiful}} man who is young and full of vigour, but hairy, barbaric, with hands hard and dirty, the dirt ingrained. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> hands are very ugly, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> mouth is not firmly shapen, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> limbs are hairy and brutal: but his eyes are deep and very beautiful.

6000|$|... "Don't <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>'is</b> name--at {{least part}} of it; an' the 'abitation of 'is wife, or sweet-'eart, or sister, or suthin' o' that sort?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>his</b> hand might be stained with blood.|$|R

60|$|Aur. I'll proceed no farther, if Benito goes: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> folly {{will produce}} some mischief.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{look about}} him, {{added to his}} tone and manner, set me strong against him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> father had not been of this stamp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is Ravoninohitriniony! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> knock. He is come!" [...] exclaimed a girlish voice, {{as a pair}} of {{arms were}} seen dimly to {{encircle}} the guide's neck.|$|R

6000|$|DAISY. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> obstinacy. When he's {{once made}} up his mind--[Contemptuously.]--he prides himself on his firmness. Oh, what shall I do? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Am I not?" [...] he {{answered}} politely, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> hand was groping in the darkness, so I put out mine {{and he held}} on tightly to one finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} grocer, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> features. He takes after his mother's family; {{she was a}} Dodson. He's a fine, {{straight}} youth; what's he been brought up to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not accountable," [...] Flora replied. [...] "I {{wanted you}} to approve, but I meant to marry Harry. I loved him, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> drawbacks. But this doesn't matter; I love him now." ...|$|R

60|$|COKESON. [Scanning her not unprosperous figure] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> {{relations}} aren't very forthy about him. Perhaps you can {{do something}} for him, till he finds his feet.|$|E
60|$|His vehemence {{made any}} words I could say sound weak {{before they were}} uttered. What {{argument}} could I show stronger than that he had already put before himself? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> answer to everything I could urge.|$|R
6000|$|... --O, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him, Myles Crawford said, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.

6000|$|... "Stop that croaking, you white-headed crow," [...] I said, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> {{words were}} true. What chance had a laager of ten waggons all told against {{at least two}} {{thousand}} of the bravest savages in the world? ...|$|R
