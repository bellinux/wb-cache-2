DXS allows that data to be easily downloaded and installed from within the application instead of manually downloading it.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{developed}} under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving {{the impression that the}} language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> Web programming language.|$|E

500|$|... "Finally" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics. Boye acclaimed the recording {{and stated that}} the singer [...] "knew this number would cause a frenzy", in addition to declaring it a [...] "potential chart topper". A different critic from tooXclusive described [...] "Finally" [...] as a [...] "confirmed hit" [...] and predicted {{that it would be}} very successful on Nigerian radio. Oye AKD from the music website 360 Nobs listed the single in their [...] "360Recommends" [...] column and claimed: [...] "D'banj is back in the building with this <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> single." [...] Commercially, it was listed on MTV Base's Official Naija Top Ten chart, where it debuted and peaked at the bottom position of number ten for the week of 25 October through 31 October 2013.|$|E
500|$|Melinda Newman of HitFix {{positively}} {{received the}} video, stating [...] "its success lies solely in the charisma and believability that the trio {{brings to the}} small screen, which is considerable."

[...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Though their scenes together are G-rated in comparison to Ciara's steamy romp with Justin Timberlake in their new clip for 'Love Sex Magic,' Hilson’s solo shots in bed are undeniably hot. Indeed, a tasteful flash of booty never hurt nobody." [...] In an interview on the Today Show, anchor Hoda Kotb made a remark to Ne-Yo, stating, [...] "You have this really <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> video that you do with Kanye West and another woman named Keri. You [...] are such big stars. How did this happen?" [...] Blogs reported this as a possible [...] "diss" [...] toward Hilson, however, neither camps reported anything after the fact.|$|E
500|$|From the outset, Dallas was {{centered}} around {{the lives of the}} wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas, Texas. Once the show became a success after the initial run as a five-episode miniseries, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced the parents of [...] Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who had not been shown on-screen until that point. Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show. Her husband, John Marshall, convinced her to take the opportunity. In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings, Van Ark said: [...] "At the time Dallas came up, I was doing two different jobs. They offered me to join Dallas, which would be shot in Dallas, Texas at Southfork. I read the script and it was buzzed about already...they were saying this was the <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> show. I said to myself, 'How can I be in Los Angeles doing this, down in Dallas, and then back in New York doing two days worth of Estée Lauder commercials?' He (my husband) read it and said, 'You've got to. It's a wonderful part. So, my husband talked me into a role that would become a fifteen-year chapter in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her earlier}} episodes, {{producers}} {{set up a}} rivalry between Babe and her brother-in-law Stan Carter, portrayed by Timothy West. The reason for their shared hatred was not explained until Sylvie arrived, when {{it was revealed that}} Babe was in love with Stan and believed Sylvie stole Stan when they were younger. Vicky Prior of the Metro described that there is [...] "no love lost" [...] between Babe and Stan, and speculated that Babe and Stan may have had an affair. Katy Brent-Stacey of the Daily Mirror said Babe's life was [...] "wasted" [...] because she spent it [...] "hoping that Stan would notice her". Miller (Daily Express) described Babe as being [...] "madly in love" [...] with Stan. All About Soap said that [...] "all those years of unrequited love [...] made Babe pretty bitter". Shelley (Daily Mail) was critical of Babe's feelings for Stan, writing, [...] " [...] only made worse by the scriptwriters' occasional, predictable, attempts at trying to evoke viewers' sympathy over her lovelorn feelings for her sister's husband Stan." [...] When Stan is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, Babe is [...] "devastated" [...] at the prospect of losing him. Stan becomes engaged to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and when his health deteriorates, they decide to marry quickly. Babe attempts to ruin it by bringing Sylvie to see Stan, but they decide to marry nevertheless. Babe is delighted when Stan is physically unable to say his vows, but is devastated when he dies. Gary Gillatt of Inside Soap expressed his approval of Babe's rivalry with Cora and said, [...] "there's a <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> rivalry in Walford – and we can't get enough if it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Stop This Car", was {{originally}} {{rumored to be}} the lead single from Unexpected, however it was later confirmed as the second single – only to be later changed in favor of [...] "The Greatest". [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] was the first solo original release by Williams that was not distinctly Gospel in style or genre, causing the song to gain much media attention online. In describing Williams's new artistic direction, Hillary Crosley wrote, [...] "there's a clear {{move away from the}} gospel." [...] When the song premiered on People.com, Brian Orloff posted, [...] "It's a <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> look and new sound." [...] Meanwhile, noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul stated: [...] "Williams' first solo pop/R LP 'Unexpected' is pioneered by the electro-club grooves of its melodically-soulful offshoot single 'We Break The Dawn'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There are {{all sorts}} of things I can't express about this and want to. There's this {{difference}} that has always been between us, that you like nakedness and wildness, and I, clothing and restraint. It goes through everything. You are always TALKING of order and system, and the splendid dream of the order that might replace the muddled system you hate, but by a sort of instinct you seem to want to break the law. I've watched you so closely. Now I want to obey laws, to make sacrifices, to follow rules. I don't want to make, but I do want to keep. You are at once makers and rebels, you and Isabel too. You're bad people--criminal people, I feel, and yet full of something the world must have. You're so much better than me, and so much viler. It may be there is no making without destruction, {{but it seems to me}} sometimes that it is nothing but an instinct for lawlessness that drives you. You remind me--do you remember?--of that time we went from Naples to Vesuvius, and walked over the <b>hot</b> <b>new</b> lava there. Do you remember how tired I was? I know it disappointed you that I was tired. One walked there in spite of the heat because there was a crust; like custom, like law. But directly a crust forms on things, you are restless to break down to the fire again. You talk of beauty, both of you, as something terrible, mysterious, imperative. YOUR beauty is something altogether different from anything I know or feel. It has pain in it. Yet you always speak as though it was something I ought to feel and am dishonest not to feel. MY beauty is a quiet thing. You have always laughed at my feeling for old-fashioned chintz and blue china and Sheraton. But I like all these familiar USED things. My beauty is STILL beauty, and yours, is excitement. I know nothing of the fascination of the fire, or why one should go deliberately out of all the decent fine things of life to run dangers and be singed and tormented and destroyed. I don't understand...." ...|$|E
