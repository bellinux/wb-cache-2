In 1907, a German chemist, Edwin Cuno Kayser, moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, the home town of soap manufacturer Procter & Gamble. He had worked for British soap manufacturer Joseph Crosfield and Sons and was well acquainted with Normann's process, as Crosfield and Sons owned the British rights to Normann's patent. Soon after arriving, Kayser made a business deal with Procter & Gamble, and presented the company with two processes to hydrogenate cottonseed oil, {{with the intent of}} creating a raw material for soap. Since the product looked like lard, Procter & Gamble instead began selling it as a vegetable fat for cooking purposes in June 1911, calling it [...] "Crisco", a modification of the phrase [...] "crystallized cottonseed oil".|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "{{hydrogen}}ation" [...] {{could be}} used instead of reduction, since hydrogen is the reducing agent in {{a large number of}} reactions, especially in organic chemistry and biochemistry. But, unlike oxidation, which has been generalized beyond its root element, hydrogenation has maintained its specific connection to reactions that add hydrogen to another substance (e.g., the <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> unsaturated <b>fats</b> into saturated fats, R−CH=CH−R + H2 → R−CH2−CH2−R). The word [...] "redox" [...] was first used in 1928.|$|R

The processing of low or null price feedstock to produce energy through hydrogenation is an interesting solution for waste valorisation.

40|$|Nutrition {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic needs of the human body. It ensures the {{introduction}} of substances needed to sustain life of the organism, its growth and proper development. In the food pyramid, fats together with carbohydrates are at the very top. One source <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> in human nutrition is margarine. Margarine comprises at least 82 % vegetable fats and 16 % water. The remainder consists of lecithin, sugar, salt, colours, and vitamins. The margarine production process involves <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> vegetable <b>fats,</b> assembling the margarine mixture, emulsifying, crystallization and packing. The objective of this study was to show that margarine could be prepared in a school laboratory under conditions that are applicable for such laboratory. Meaning:a) In a school laboratory at normal pressure and at elevated temperature with nickel as catalyst, i. e. without the use of an autoclave, carry out the reaction <b>of</b> <b>hydrogenation</b> soybean and palm oil in order to obtain a vegetable fat that is the basic ingredient of margarine. During the preparation <b>of</b> margarine, the <b>hydrogenation</b> reaction was carefully monitored by determining the iodine value. b) Preparation of margarine obtained from vegetable fats. c) Determination and comparison of selected physical and chemical properties of the product with the same properties of several types of margarines available on the market. The following properties were determined:– Melting point, in order to obtain composition <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> phase and determine suitability for humanuse. – Acid value, as an indicator of the amount of free fatty acids that influence the taste. – Peroxide value, for insight into the oxidative stability <b>of</b> <b>fats.</b> This work has shown that it is possible to make vegetable fat in a school lab by <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> vegetable oils. Unlike the industrial process <b>of</b> <b>hydrogenation</b> carried out under a pressure of 0. 36 to 2 atm, which takes about two hours, our reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure but with a greater amount of catalyst, and took six hours for soybean oil, and four hours for palm oil.

40|$|<b>Hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> {{vegetable}} <b>fats</b> is {{an important}} biomolecule modification process, traditionally carried out in a slurry reactor at low pressure (2 – 6 bar). Here, the <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> sunflower oil in supercritical propane and dimethyl ether catalysed by Pd (supported on activated carbon or alumina) is studied. One-dimensional simulation models for plug flow and mixed flow reactors, as well as two-dimensional dispersed plug flow reactor models, were developed for the case of isothermal and adiabatic operation. The <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>of</b> sunflower oil is considered as a reaction network based on linoleate, oleate (cis C 18 : 1), elaidate (trans C 18 : 1) and stearate triesters. Since trans fatty C 18 : 1 ester and stearate formation is not desired, the question arises as to which reactor type is best to achieve a low elaidate content. Depending on the final allowed stearate content, different mixed and plug flow reactor models can be applied. However, for a fixed stearate formation rate, the mixed reactor gives a lower trans content than the plug flow reactor in most cases. Also, low temperature operation results in better oleate/stearate selectivity. Two-dimensional tubular reactor dispersed simulation does not give further insight into the problem. The use of Multiphysics (finite element method) for solving the dispersed plug flow model provides a way to simulate CSTR reactor behaviour. In our case, both heat and mass Péclet numbers of 10 − 4 or less are sufficient to describe well-mixed reactor behaviour using the 2 D mass and heat transfer pseudo-homogeneous model with radial and axial effects, with parameter values available for SCF.

The following polymorphic forms were detected: sub-alpha, alpha, beta', beta' 3, beta' 2, beta, beta 2, and beta 1; however, not all forms were observed in all fats.

40|$|The use of {{residues}} or wastes in {{biofuel production}} {{is a potential}} solution to the questioned increase of the food market price. The hydrogenation (more specifically hydrodeoxygenation) of residues or wastes rich in free fatty acids {{seems to be an}} interesting option for the valorisation of this type of feedstock. The major obstacle of this process is the high temperature and high H 2 pressure process requirement. The way to reduce it is the use of a co-solvent e. g. supercritical fluids. At supercritical conditions, CO 2 is completely miscible with H 2 {{and at the same time}} is also a great solvent for non-polar liquids allowing enhanced efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogenation</b> leading to the ability to perform reactions at milder conditions.

The CO 2 presence influences positively the concentration of hydrocarbons minimising the presence of glycerides' content in the final product mixture. At elevated CO 2 pressure, a high concentration of hydrocarbons simultaneously with a low presence of free fatty acids and glycerides' content in the mixture was obtained. A similar effect was observed for reaction carried out for 6 hours, when above 90 wt% of all hydrocarbons present in the mixture were the saturated ones. Additionally, the reuse of catalyst increases the saturated hydrocarbons' content to values similar to those obtained for reactions with prolonged residence time.
