5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{of what would}} become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin. The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16thcentury in search of a warmer, more temperate climate. The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan, they sailed down the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River and made contact with the local Potawatomi, who would dominate the area by 1768. One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along {{the west bank of the}} <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River, from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region.|$|E

Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of Bannockburn at Interstate 94 (where it is {{a portion of the}} Tri-State Tollway). Route 22 crosses the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94.|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire Marriott Resort {{takes up}} a large area of land {{to the west of}} the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River, and has an eighteen-hole golf course that hugs Illinois Route 22 to the south; the golf course is not only {{available}} to guests, but also offers lessons to local residents. The resort is also home to the Marriott Theatre, which garnered a reputation through the acceptance of 370 Joseph Jefferson Award nominations presented throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. The Cumberland station became particularly attractive to suburban commuters from <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in the Cumberland and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. The influx of suburban commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire is {{a village}} in Vernon Township, Lake County, in the U.S. state of Illinois. The village is a {{northern}} suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{lies in a}} {{floodplain}} region, {{a consequence}} of the presence of the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River and the proximity a fork of the Chicago River on the far east border. A third factor involves small Indian Creek, which runs north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.|$|E
5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Lincolnshire is {{a suburb of}} the city of Chicago in the {{southern}} reaches of Lake County; like Chicago, Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois. The <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines</b> River meanders through {{the eastern part of the}} village, dividing the town in half vertically at the village hall, while Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) splits the village in half in an east–west direction. Milwaukee Avenue (U.S. Route 45) runs in a north–south direction through Lincolnshire, into the village of Buffalo Grove to the south and Vernon Hills to the north.|$|E
5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in <b>Des</b> <b>Plaines.</b> Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille <b>des</b> <b>Plaines</b> d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
