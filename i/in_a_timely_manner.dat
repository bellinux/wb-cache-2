5|$|Prior to Debra's {{arrival in}} Texas, {{numerous}} hurricane warnings were issued {{and at least}} 8,600individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. Sea vessels took {{the brunt of the}} storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685million, and total damage from the storm reached $7million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was fortunate that any warnings were issued, and those that were had been delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 167 Bikini {{residents}} who {{were moved to}} the Rongerik Atoll prior to the Crossroads tests were unable to gather sufficient food or catch enough fish and shellfish to feed themselves in their new environment.

With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more important, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their native culture of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their four thousand descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.|$|E

2500|$|Paul has {{proposed}} radical {{changes in the}} way medical malpractice claims are handled. Under [...] bills he has introduced multiple times beginning <b>in</b> 2003, <b>a</b> patient planning pregnancy, surgery, or other major medical procedures or medical treatment would be able to buy “negative outcomes” insurance at very low cost. If the patient were to experience <b>a</b> negative outcome <b>in</b> association with the medical procedure or treatment, he or she would then seek compensation through binding arbitration, rather than through a medical malpractice trial before a jury. Paul claims that “using insurance, private contracts, and binding arbitration to resolve medical disputes benefits patients, who receive full compensation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timelier</b> <b>manner</b> than under the current system,” as well as physicians and hospitals, since their litigation costs, and malpractice insurance premiums, would be markedly reduced.|$|R
30|$|Note {{that none}} of the {{requirements}} is defined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clear quantitative manner. For example, RF engineers will not come clearly and say that we need a system that performs 2 nd or 3 rd order intermodulation for (N) signals in less than (X) seconds. Ironically, the telecomm industry until today states the requirement for completing an intermodulation interference analysis for <b>a</b> given site <b>in</b> days (typically 48  hours) rather than minutes or seconds. This is due to the complexity of the analysis which includes sorting and searching billions of elements in large files. It is also {{due to the lack of}} well defined strategy for defining the performance requirement of such system. Industry, however, acknowledges the need to address interference analysis <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timelier</b> <b>manner</b> [30 – 32].

5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year.

Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to such legislation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused.

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner</b> (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
50|$|Daly and Wilson {{point out}} that {{infanticide}} is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world. For example, when an immigrant male lion enters a pride, {{it is not uncommon}} for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males. Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in competition with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity. In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to sexual receptivity in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timelier</b> <b>manner.</b> These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{predict that}} firms with {{stronger}} corporate governance will exhibit {{a higher degree}} of accounting conservatism. Governance level is assessed using a com-posite measure that incorporates several internal and external characteristics. Consistent with our prediction, strong governance firms show significantly higher levels of con-ditional accounting conservatism. Our tests take into account the endogenous nature of corporate governance, and the results are robust to the use of several measures of conservatism (market-based and nonmarket-based). Our evidence is consistent with the direction of causality flowing from governance to conservatism, and not vice versa, indicating that governance and conservatism are not substitutes. Finally, we study the impact of earnings discretion on the sensitivity of earnings to bad news across gover-nance structures. We find that, on average, strong-governance firms appear to use discretionary accruals to inform investors about bad news <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timelier</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|R

5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an {{industry}} trade organisation representing over 240 airlines (representing 84% of global air traffic)—and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations' civil aviation body—began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The IATA created {{a task force}} (which included several outside stakeholders) to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft. The IATA's task force planned {{to come up with}} several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner</b> to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident. The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but on that day said that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues. In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals, although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes. The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believes cannot be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO. Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority and such standards must be adopted by member states.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>manner.</b> The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the relationship between journals {{and the members of}} their editorial committees who publish articles in them.
