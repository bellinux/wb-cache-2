Similarly, different means have been used to densify the soils prepared with such methods. However, the influence of the densification technique, utilized within a particular deposition method, on undrained behavior (e. g. change in initial peak deviator stress and instability angle) was not known. Therefore, a new densification technique is developed for the <b>dry</b> funnel <b>deposition</b> method, which avoids tamping, vibrating or mold tapping. This new method of densification is thought to create a much consistent soil fabric for different amounts of densification than other specimen densification techniques. The experimental results show that the change in undrained behavior with increasing density produced by densification is much less pronounced when compared to the other densification methods reported in the literature. Prior research efforts regarding the effect of non plastic silts on the liquefaction behavior of sands mainly focused on the influence of fines content, confining stress, and depositional techniques. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the influence of fines content on the undrained behavior of silty sands. Strain-controlled monotonic undrained triaxial compression tests were performed on a single base sand mixed with three different essentially nonplastic silts. First, silt size effects are investigated while other factors like fines content (20...|$|R

In addition, SVOCs are removed from the atmosphere and transported to the waters by precipitation scavenging of atmospheric vapors and particles, which are incorporated into the rain within or below the clouds. After SVOCs are deposited into the bulk seawater, water-column partitioning can affect the distribution of pollutants between the dissolved aqueous and the solid phases and eventually impact the fate of these compounds in oceans. Other than the abovementioned processes, air-sea exchange can make SVOCs diffuse across the air-sea interface; however, the sea surface microlayer (SML), a unique compartment at the air-sea boundary defined operationally as the upper millimeter (1 [*]∼[*] 1000 [*]μm) of the sea surface, has large storage capacity to delay the transport of SVOCs across the interface.
