5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom to improvise his lines. Iago's supervising {{animator}} Will Finn tried to incorporate {{some aspects of}} Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E
5|$|During his life, H.P.N. Muller {{published}} {{well over}} 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these – <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> newspaper articles – were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles {{he wrote about}} the South African War when he was consul general for the Orange Free State were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect.|$|E
50|$|Hegel {{used two}} {{different}} sets of terms for his triads, namely, abstract-negative-concrete (<b>especially</b> in <b>his</b> Phenomenology of 1807), as well as, immediate-mediate-concrete (<b>especially</b> in <b>his</b> Science of Logic of 1812), depending on the scope of his argumentation.|$|R
50|$|Donne's {{works are}} also witty, {{employing}} paradoxes, puns, and subtle yet remarkable analogies. His pieces are often ironic and cynical, especially regarding love and human motives. Common subjects of Donne's poems are love (<b>especially</b> in <b>his</b> early life), death (<b>especially</b> after <b>his</b> wife's death), and religion.|$|R

5|$|Henry {{comes from}} a family in which {{almost all of the}} men are larger than average, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> great uncle Chudd, who was 6ft 7 in, weighed {{approximately}} 500lb, never had a pair of manufactured shoes, and was known as the strongest man in the Piney Woods of East Texas.|$|E
5|$|Lapworth {{also had}} a {{prominent}} {{role to play in}} the fame of Dob's Linn, a small gorge in the Scottish Borders, which contains the 'golden spike' (i.e. the official international boundary or stratotype) between the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Lapworth's work in this area, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> examination of the complex stratigraphy of the Silurian rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, was crucial in to the early understanding of these epochs.|$|E
5|$|Letellier {{describes}} Meyerbeer's mature life as 'a {{tale of two}} cities...His artistic {{triumph and}} legendary status were achieved in Paris...but he never abandoned Prussia, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> home city of Berlin'. His wife Minna was based in Berlin (she did not enjoy Paris) as was his beloved mother; {{and he had a}} series of Royal duties from the Prussian court, stemming from his appointment as Court Kapellmeister in 1832. For these reasons his life from 1830 onwards is characterised by travel between these two centres.|$|E

5|$|Pryce's death, and its horrific nature, {{were met}} with great grief from all {{those who knew him}} during his career, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team.

5|$|The Manoj–Babli {{honour killing}} {{case was the}} honour killing of Indian newlyweds Manoj Banwala and Babli in June 2007 and the {{successive}} court case which historically convicted defendants for an honour killing. The individuals involved in the murder included relatives of Babli (grandfather Gangaraj {{who is said to}} have been a Khap leader, brother, maternal and paternal uncles and two cousins). Relatives of Manoj, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> mother, defended the relationship.|$|E

5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended {{to serve as}} a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. Fischer moved into {{an apartment in the}} same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> son, were very close to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him {{on a wide variety of}} subjects.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes {{may have been in}} part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E

5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> success in capturing William.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> Lives of the Poets series, {{describe}} {{various features}} of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E

Despite the party itself, the king's spirits are brought down {{by the absence of}} his son, Triton, spoiling the festivities for everyone, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> wife, Queen Amphitrite. Triton was banished to a cage on the deserted Island in the Sky, until he is ready to be a proper god, having displeased his father with his growing interests in the mortal world.|$|E
5|$|Kono's {{inspiration}} for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> film Phenomena (1985). The game began as an experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was not directed by Kono and was a critical failure. Human Entertainment {{went out of business}} in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. They would go on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, <b>especially</b> <b>his</b> performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E
