40|$|We {{consider}} continuum free-free {{radio emission}} {{from the upper}} atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation {{within the framework of}} EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust tail of the disc and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14 - 18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combining observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^ 2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> dispersal.

A thermal camera is used to observe heat distribution within the sliding fist type brake system during a heavy braking situation. It is seen that the disc appears to exhibit localised hot areas and the pad is seen to vary in temperature along its length, it being hotter at the leading edge. Observations of the pad face after heavy braking gives some indication of the pressure distribution across its face during this operation. Interrogation of one image is able to indicate temperature variation across the hub region, even the splines being identified within the temperature profile. A friction material with an artificially high coefficient of friction was used to promote noise. The whole body visual technique of holographic interferometry is used to investigate the modes of vibration of the principal component parts, mirrors being used to allow visual access to otherwise hidden areas. Holograms of the main vibrating components are presented and discussed. The images indicate the vibrational characteristics of the commercial brake {{are similar to those}} of a car brake and that positive cross-correlation of information may be a possibility.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{theoretical}} study investigating the effects of photoionization and heating by X-rays on discs around low-mass stars. In particular we address {{the question of whether or}} not X-rays can drive a disc wind. First, we construct a 1 -dimensional ``quasi-hydrostatic'' model, which solves for the vertical structure introduced by X-ray heating. We consider uniform X-ray illumination of the disc, but the X-ray fluxes required to heat the disc significantly are much greater than those seen by recent observations. When the model is extended to consider heating from a central X-ray source we find that the 1 -dimensional model is only valid very close to the star. We extend our analysis to consider a simple 2 -dimensional model, treating the disc as a two-layered structure and solving for its density profile self-consistently. For T Tauri stars we are able to set a crude upper limit on the mass-loss rate that can be driven by X-ray photoevaporation, with a value of ~ 10 ^- 13 g/cm^ 2 /s. Our model is designed to maximise this value, and most likely over-estimates it significantly. However we still find a mass-loss rate which is less than that found in studies of ultraviolet photoevaporation. We conclude that in the presence of a significant UV field, X-ray <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> winds are unlikely to play a significant role in the evolution of discs around low-mass stars.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{near-infrared}} (NIR) HI emission lines in young stellar objects are not yet understood. To probe it, we present multi-epoch LBT-LUCIFER spectroscopic observations of the Paδ, Paβ, and Brγ lines observed in the Herbig star VVSer, along with VLTI-AMBER Brγ spectro-interferometric observations at medium resolution. Our spectroscopic observations show line profile variability in all the HI lines. The strongest variability is observed in the redshifted part of the line profiles. The Brγ spectro-interferometric observations indicate that the Brγ line emitting region is smaller than the continuum emitting region. To interpret our results, we employed radiative transfer models with three different flow configurations: magnetospheric accretion, a magneto-centrifugally <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> wind, and a schematic bipolar outflow. Our models suggest that the HI line emission in VVSer {{is dominated by the}} contribution of an extended wind, perhaps a bipolar outflow. Although the exact physical process for producing such outflow is not known, this model is capable of reproducing the averaged single-peaked line profiles of the HI lines. Additionally, the observed visibilities, differential and closure phases are best reproduced when a wind is considered. Nevertheless, the complex line profiles and variability could be explained by changes in the relative contribution of the magnetosphere and/or winds to the line emission. This might indicate that the NIR HI lines are formed in a complex inner disc region where inflow and outflow components might coexist. Furthermore, the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the line appears time variable, suggesting a non-steady accretion/ejection flow. Comment: accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|A simple 1 D {{dynamical}} {{model of}} thermally <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> winds is proposed, {{based on the}} results of recent, 2. 5 D axi-symmetric simulations. Our formulation of the disc wind problem is in the spirit of the original Parker (1958) and Bondi (1952) problems, namely we assume an elementary flow configuration consisting of an outflow following pre-defined trajectories in the presence of a central gravitating point mass. Viscosity and heat conduction are neglected. We consider two different streamline geometries, both comprised of straight lines in the (x,z) -plane: (i) streamlines that converge to a geometric point located at (x,z) =(0,-d) and (ii) streamlines that emerge at a constant inclination angle from the disc midplane (the x-axis, as we consider geometrically thin accretion discs). The former geometry is commonly used in kinematic models to compute synthetic spectra, while the latter, which exhibits self-similarity, is likely unused for this purpose, although it easily can be with existing kinematic models. We make the case that it should be, i. e. that geometry (ii) leads to transonic wind solutions with substantially different properties owing to its lack of streamline divergence. Both geometries can be used to complement recent efforts to estimate photoevaporative mass loss rates from protoplanetary discs. Pertinent to understanding our disc wind results, which are also applicable to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, is a focused discussion on lesser known properties of classic Parker wind solutions. We find that the parameter space corresponding to decelerating Parker wind solutions is made larger due to rotation and leads instead to disc wind solutions that always accelerate after the bulk velocity is slowed to a minimum value. Surprisingly, Keplerian rotation may allow for two different transonic wind solutions for the same physical conditions. Comment: 30 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} XMM-Newton {{observations}} of the black hole X-ray binary 4 U 1630 - 47 during its 2012 - 2013 outburst. The first five observations monitor the source as its luminosity increases across the high-soft state of accretion. In the sixth observation the source has made a transition to an "anomalous" state, characterised by a significant contribution of electron scattering. A thermally/radiatively <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> wind {{is present in the}} first four observations, which becomes more photoionised as the luminosity increases with time. In the fifth observation, the wind is not observed any more as a consequence of strong photoionisation and the low sensitivity of this observation. This overall trend is then consistent with a fully ionised wind causing the electron scattering characteristic of the anomalous state in the sixth observation. A broad iron emission line co-exists with the absorption features from the wind in the first four observations but is not visible in the last two observations. We find that the changes {{in the state of the}} wind as measured from modelling the absorption features with a self-consistent warm absorber model are correlated to the changes in the broad iron line. When the latter is modeled with a reflection component we find that the reflection fraction decreases as the illumination increases. We propose that the changes in both the absorption and broad emission lines are caused by the increasing luminosity and temperature of the accretion disc along the soft state. Such changes ultimately enable the transition to a state where the wind is fully ionised and consequently Comptonisation plays a significant role. Comment: Replacement: note added in proof.

40|$|Aims: We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} protoplanetary discs (PPDs hereafter) with magnetically <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider an initially massive disc with ~ 0. 1 Msun to track the evolution from the early stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature by taking into account viscous heating {{and the loss of}} the mass and the angular momentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass loss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results: Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different from the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in a "wind-driven accretion" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the radial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region < 1 - 10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial slope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because (i) it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of our calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems. Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures embedded, accepted by A&A (comments are welcome...|$|E
40|$|In {{this third}} paper {{in a series}} of three, we present a {{detailed}} study of the AGN broadband SED based on a nearby unobscured Type 1 AGN sample. We perform a systematic cross-correlation study of the following key parameters: Γ_ 2 - 10 keV, L_ 2 - 10 keV, L_bol, L_bol/L_Edd, κ_ 2 - 10 keV, κ_ 5100 A, FWHM_Hβ, M_BH, α_ox, α_X and α_UV, and identify various strong correlations among these parameters. The principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on the correlation matrix of the above parameters, which shows that the three physical parameters, i. e. black hole mass, mass accretion rate and Eddington ratio, drive the majority of the correlations. This is consistent with PCA results found from previous optical spectral studies. We produce various mean SEDs classified by each of the key parameters. Most parameters, except L_bol, show similar systematic changes in the mean SEDs such that the temperature at which the disc peaks is correlated with the ratio of power in the disc versus the Comptonised components and the hard X-ray spectral index. This underlying change in SED shape shows that AGN do exhibit intrinsically different spectral states. This is superficially similar to the SED differences in BHB seen as λ_Edd increases, but the analogy does not hold in detail. Only objects with the highest λ_Edd appear to correspond to a BHB spectral state (the disc dominated high/soft state). The AGN with typical mass accretion rates have spectra which do not match well with any state observed in BHB. We speculate that this could be due to the presence of a powerful UV line <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> wind, which complicates simple mass scaling between stellar and supermassive black holes.

40|$|We {{show that}} if young low mass stars undergo {{vigorous}} X-ray <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> winds, {{these may be}} detected in clusters through their interaction with ionising radiation from massive stars. We argue that in the ONC (Orion Nebula Cluster) one should see ∼ 10 s of `X-ray proplyds' (objects with optically imaged offset ionisation fronts) in the range 0. 3 - 0. 6 pc from θ_ 1 C Ori (the dominant O star in the ONC). Such objects lie outside the central `FUV zone' in the ONC where proplyds are instead well explained by neutral winds driven by external Far Ultraviolet (FUV) emission from θ_ 1 C. We show that the predicted numbers and sizes of X-ray proplyds are compatible with those observed and that this may also explain {{at least some of}} the far flung proplyds seen in the Carina nebula. We compare the sizes of observed proplyds outside the FUV region of the ONC with model predictions based on the current observed X-ray luminosities of these sources (bearing in mind that the current size is actually set by the X-ray luminosity a few hundred years ago, ∼ the flow time to the ionisation front). We discuss whether variability on this timescale can plausibly explain proplyd size data on a case by case basis. We also show that the predicted radio free-free emission signature of X-ray proplyds is readily detectable. Monitoring is however required to distinguish such emission from non-thermal emission from active coronae. We also predict that it is only at > 1 pc from θ_ 1 C that the free-free emission from such offset ionised structures would be clearly distinguishable from an externally driven ionised disc wind. We argue that the fortuitous proximity of massive stars in the ONC can be used as a beacon to light up internally driven X-ray winds and that this is a promising avenue for observationally testing X-ray photoevaporation.

However, the exact physical processes involved are not yet fully understood. We present high angular and spectral resolution observations of the Br Gamma emitting region in the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 (MWC 275) in order to probe {{the origin of this}} line and constrain the physical processes taking place at sub-AU scales in the circumstellar region. By means of VLTI-AMBER observations at high spectral resolution (R~ 12000), we studied interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differential phases, and closure phases across the Br Gamma line of HD 163296. To constrain the physical origin of the Br Gamma line in Herbig Ae stars, all the interferometric observables were compared with the predictions of a line radiative transfer disc wind model. The measured visibilities clearly increase within the Br Gamma line, indicating that the Br Gamma emitting region is more compact than the continuum. By fitting a geometric Gaussian model to the continuum-corrected Br Gamma visibilities, we derived a compact radius of the Br Gamma emitting region of ~ 0. 07 +/- 0. 02 AU (Gaussian half width at half maximum; or a ring-fit radius of ~ 0. 08 +/- 0. 02 AU). To interpret the observations, we developed a magneto-centrifugally <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> wind model. Our best disc wind model is able to reproduce, within the errors, all the interferometric observables and it predicts a launching region with an outer radius of ~ 0. 04 AU. However, the intensity distribution of the entire disc wind emitting region extends up to ~ 0. 16 AU. Our observations, along with a detailed modelling of the Br Gamma emitting region, suggest that most of the Br Gamma emission in HD 163296 originates from a disc wind with a launching region that is over five times more compact than previous estimates of the continuum dust rim radius.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} millimetre wavelength observations of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) both via interferometric and single dish observations. First, the high angular resolution observations (up to ∼ 0. 1 ”) {{from a variety of}} interferometers of the MYSO, S 140 IRS 1, are presented. This source is one of only two prototypes that have ionised equatorial emission from a radiatively <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> wind. The observations confirm that IRS 1 has a dusty disc at a position angle compatible with that of the disc wind emission, and confirms the disc wind nature for the first time. Secondly, the observations of S 140 IRS 1 are modelled using a 2 D axisymmetric radiative transfer code. Extensive models producing synthetic data at millimetre wavelengths were developed. These models show that on the largest scales, typically accessible with single dish observations or compact interferometric configurations, the spectral energy distribution is relatively unchanged by the addition of a compact dust disc. However, a disc is required to match the interferometric visibilities at the smaller scales. The position angle of the disc is well constrained via a newly developed 2 D visibility fitting method. The models however, are degenerate and there are a range of realistic best fitting discs. The third section presents the single dish observations of the core material traced by C 18 O around 99 MYSOs and compact HII regions from the RMS survey. A method to calculate the core masses and velocity extent is reported. The method is accurate and robust, and can be applied to any molecular line emission. An updated distance limited sample contains 87 sources and is complete to 103 L⊙. It is a representative sample of MYSOs and HII regions. All of the cores harbour at least one massive protostar. Finally, methodologies to establish outflow parameters via 12 CO (3 - 2) and 13 CO (3 - 2) data are investigated. Multiple techniques are trialed for a well studied test source, IRAS 20126 + 4104, and a repeatable outflow analysis pathway is described. In more complex regions using the 12 CO emission to identify outflows and determine the mass is more difficult and an alternative method is suggested. Moreover, the dynamical timescale of the outflows and the dynamical parameters are estimated in a spatial sense rather than using a simple average. Such analysis will aid in categorising different outflows from the full sample...|$|E
