25|$|The nested RT-PCR assay {{developed}} during the initial <b>HCPS</b> outbreak provided a rapid method for the genetic characterization of novel hantaviruses that did not require a virus isolate. Numerous new hantaviruses have been detected by RT-PCR in rodent tissues but {{have yet to be}} associated with human disease. These include El Moro Canyon virus associated with the western harvest mouse, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Tula virus with Microtus arvalis and M. rossiaemeridionalis, Rio Segundo virus with the Mexican harvest mouse, R. mexicanus, Isla Vista virus with the California vole, M. californicus, and Prospect Hill-like viruses in Microtus species.|$|E

Isolation was achieved through blind passage in Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) and subsequent adaptation to growth in Vero E6 cells. Additional viral strains have also been isolated from P. maniculatus associated with a fatal case in California and P. leucopus from the vicinity of probable infection of a New York case. Black Creek Canal virus was isolated from S. hispidus collected near the residence of a human case in Dade County, Florida. Another etiologic agent of <b>HCPS,</b> Bayou virus, was first isolated from the vicinity of Monroe, Louisiana.|$|E

This is achieved by first considering various restrictions of <b>HCP.</b> Known conversions from directed <b>HCP</b> to undirected <b>HCP,</b> and sub-cubic <b>HCP</b> to cubic <b>HCP</b> are given. We introduce a subgraph called a 4 -gate and show {{that it may be}} used to convert sub-quartic <b>HCP</b> into sub-cubic <b>HCP.</b> We further generalise this idea by first introducing the 5 -gate, and then the s-gate for any s >= 4. We prove that these subgraphs may be used to convert general instances of <b>HCP</b> into cubic <b>HCP</b> instances, where the input size of the converted instance is a quadratic function of that of the original instance. This result improves upon the previously best known approach which results in cubic growth {{in the size of the}} instance. We further prove that the quadratic function is reduced to a linear function if the maximum initial degree is bounded above by a constant. Motivated by this result, we describe an algorithm to convert general <b>HCP</b> to <b>HCP</b> of bounded degree and prove that it results in only linear growth. All of the above results are then used in the proof that any instance of <b>HCP</b> may be converted to an equivalent instance 3 <b>HCP</b> with only linear growth in the input size...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} method {{to developing a}} <b>HCP</b> for target species of concern {{is to develop a}} <b>HCP</b> for a particular habitat type. Under this approach, a specific habitat type found within the <b>HCP</b> area is selected as the focus of the <b>HCP</b> by the permittee and USFWS/NMFS based on the species known to use the habitat. The habitat-based <b>HCP</b> must consider all sensitive species known to use the particular habitat type and all of their habitat-related needs. All species considered within the habitat-based <b>HCP</b> may be included under the Incidental Take Permit. The benefit of developing a habitat-based <b>HCP</b> rather than a species-based <b>HCP</b> is that, if prepared properly, a single <b>HCP</b> would theoretically benefit multiple species or an entire ecosystem rather than only protecting the species listed under the ESA.|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic cell {{phosphatase}} (<b>HCP)</b> is a tyrosine phosphatase {{with two}} Src homology 2 (SH 2) domains that is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, including cells whose growth is regulated by interleukin- 3 (IL- 3). The potential effects of <b>HCP</b> on IL- 3 -induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and growth regulation were examined {{to assess the}} role of <b>HCP</b> in hematopoiesis. Our studies demonstrate that, following ligand binding, <b>HCP</b> specifically associates with the beta chain of the IL- 3 receptor through the amino-terminal SH 2 domain of <b>HCP,</b> both in vivo and in vitro, and can dephosphorylate the receptor chain in vitro. The effects of increasing or decreasing <b>HCP</b> levels in IL- 3 -dependent cells were assessed with dexamethasone-inducible constructs containing an <b>HCP</b> cDNA in sense and antisense orientations. Increased <b>HCP</b> levels were found to reduce the levels of IL- 3 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and to dramatically suppress cell growth. Conversely, decreasing the levels of <b>HCP</b> increased IL- 3 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and marginally increased growth rate. These results support a role for <b>HCP</b> in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth and begin to provide a mechanistic explanation for the dramatic effects that the genetic loss of <b>HCP,</b> which occurs in motheaten (me) and viable motheaten (mev) mice, has on hematopoiesis...|$|R

40|$|Healthcare {{personnel}} (<b>HCP)</b> frequently wear gloves {{when they}} care for patients in Standard Precautions to prevent contact with potentially infectious blood or body fluids. When <b>HCP</b> use gloves appropriately they {{reduce the risk}} of cross-contamination and decrease the risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAI). However, if <b>HCP</b> use gloves inappropriately they may inadvertently spread pathogens to patients and the patients’ environment. This study used a descriptive structured observational design to investigate three aspects of <b>HCP</b> glove use in a United States long-term care facility (LTCF). First, the PI examined the degree of inappropriate <b>HCP</b> glove use in a random sample of 76 <b>HCP.</b> Results indicate that the <b>HCP</b> used gloves inappropriately, failing to change gloves 66 % of the time when a glove change was indicated. Over 44 % of the <b>HCP</b> gloved touch points were defined as contaminated. Second, the PI examined the reliability of a new glove use tool (GUST).
