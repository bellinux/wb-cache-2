500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone {{called the}} Nuremberg trials a fraud. [...] "(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away {{conducting}} his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg," [...] he wrote. [...] "I don't mind {{what he does}} to the Nazis, but I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law.

2500|$|Due to {{concerns}} {{about a possible}} spoiler effect, many Democrats urged Nader to abandon his 2004 candidacy. Terry McAuliffe stated that Nader had a [...] "distinguished career, fighting for working families", and that McAuliffe [...] "would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> part of his legacy being that he got us eight years of George Bush". Theresa Amato, Nader's national campaign manager in 2000 and 2004, later alleged that McAuliffe offered to pay-off Nader if he would not campaign in certain states, an allegation confirmed by Nader and undisputed by McAuliffe.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{even at the}} time the Nuremberg trials {{appeared}} to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra.

I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law.

2500|$|After the war Schmitt {{preferred}} {{to work in}} relative isolation in Silvermine for the next 50 years, exhibiting locally or by invitation. A large retrospective exhibit was held in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1980, featuring of his works. In an interview done during the exhibition he stated: “I tried not to exhibit unless I had to. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] go out. I don’t like to show. It’s an interruption to painting but I feel I owe it to people.

He died in Norwalk, Connecticut a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 {{one of his}} {{mechanical}} assemblages [...] "attacked" [...] a {{woman at}} the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's annual Christmas party and holiday exhibition.

[...] One of the record players played [...] "I <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> Christmas Come Around". At the opening, which Hedrick refused to attend, he set a timer so that the piece [...] "suddenly began flashing its lights, honking its horns, and playing its records."

[...] At the time Last Crusade was filmed, Connery was still only 58. Lucas also said that age need not be a factor, as Ford was [...] "65 and did everything in this movie. The old chemistry is there, and it's not like he's an old man. He's incredibly agile; he looks even better than he did 20 years ago, if you ask me." [...] In August 2008, Lucas was researching potential plot devices, and stated Spielberg was open to the idea of the fifth film. He also changed his mind about continuing the series with a spin-off, joking [...] "Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones. If it was Mutt Williams it would be Mutt Williams and the Search for Elvis or something." [...] Two months later, Ford stated that he would not return if the fifth film was an animated film like , because [...] "I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it reduced in any way from the movies that we have done and the way we have done them." [...] He also called Lucas' concept for the fifth film [...] "crazy but great".|$|E
