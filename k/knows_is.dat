He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E

She asks them to move the body to Costello's car which she <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> parked some distance from the house to a local wood. Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive. Inspector Lord is there following a mysterious phone call to the station telling them that a murder has been committed at the house.|$|E

500|$|Murs' second studio album, the retro-pop themed In Case You Didn't Know, was {{released}} on 25 November 2011. The composition of [...] "Oh My Goodness" [...] is composed of an organ and horns, while the title track, [...] "Heart Skips a Beat" [...] and [...] "Tell the World" [...] draw influence from reggae. [...] "Dance with Me Tonight" [...] is a 1950s saxophone style record with elements of Doo-wop, while the track [...] "Just Smile" [...] {{is reminiscent of the}} work of Burt Bacharach. The disco-pop themed Right Place Right Time, Murs' third studio album, {{was released}} on 26 November 2012. Murs co-wrote the majority of the album with songwriters Steve Robson, Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett.

500|$|Author Atara Stein {{wrote that}} the song [...] "suggests that love can operate only through a willful self-deception, a {{voluntary}} surrender to what one <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> an illusion. The singer begs his lover to 'wrap the night' around him because, as he proclaims, 'I don't want to see.' The singer knows that the image he creates of his loved one is false, {{but it is the}} only image that can satisfy him. He must perceive his beloved in idealized terms, so she can reflect back to him the image of himself that he desires to see." [...] Journalist Bill Graham believed the song was a bleak account of a failing romance. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes {{wrote that the}} song [...] "takes us back– again– to the shadowy world of deceit, infidelity, and betrayal. It depicts love at the end, the very end, of its tether. It is as bleak and as despairing a view of the world as you're likely to get, reflecting the emotional climate in which the entire album had been made." [...] He noted, [...] "In terms of its mood, 'Love Is Blindness' had the dark, sensual and decadent feel of pre-war Berlin", adding that the lyric [...] "Love is blindness / I don't want to see" [...] was [...] "a desolate acknowledgement of the terrible reality that it is sometimes better not to know." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E
500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E
