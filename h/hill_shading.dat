This paper considers {{two aspects of}} their construction: simplification of terrain, and effective feature depiction through exaggerated shading. Simplification involves choosing a level-of-detail appropriate to the scale of reproduction and the desired emphasis of the map. We will model this process as a digital filtering operation applied to regularly sampled elevation data. <b>Hill</b> <b>shading</b> techniques for indicating terrain slope have seemed natural candidates for automation using bump-mapping. However, naïve application of bump mapping to elevation data fails to reproduce the distinctive character of <b>hill</b> <b>shading</b> painted by a skilled cartographer.

40|$|The {{generation}} of high resolution canopy height model (CHM) from LiDAR {{makes it possible}} to delineate individual tree crown by means of a fully-automated method using the CHM’s curvature through its slope. The local maxima are obtained by taking the maximum raster value in a 3 m x 3 m cell. These values are assumed as tree tops and therefore considered as individual trees. Based on the assumptions, thiessen polygons were generated to serve as buffers for the canopy extent. The negative profile curvature is then measured from the slope of the CHM. The results show that the aggregated points from a negative profile curvature raster provide the most realistic crown shape. The absence of field data regarding tree crown dimensions require accurate visual assessment after the appended delineated tree crown polygon was superimposed to the <b>hill</b> <b>shaded</b> CHM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] - An {{automated}} {{extraction tool}} was developed through the model builder technique in ArcGIS environment to delineate the basin morphometry. The basic requirements {{to run this}} tool are a SRTM data, and a pour point shapefile. The developed model will create necessary data required for morphometric analysis after the processing of the input data. The output from this model will create a number of parameters such as, stream network (Strahler’s), aspect, slope, DEM, drainage density, <b>hill</b> <b>shade,</b> and basin boundary in meter square. Before proceeding with the model, there is an option to the user to select the minimum upstream area to which a stream should be counted. This option helps the users to select the range of stream delineation. The slope generated will be in degrees and the drainage density in Sq. km. This technique is very useful for those {{who work in the}} field of terrain analysis, hydrology, and watershed analysis as it is easy to use with a single click for the generation of a reliable database for morphometric analysis...|$|R
