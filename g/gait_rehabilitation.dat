50|$|In adult <b>rehabilitation,</b> <b>gait</b> {{training}} is traditionally performed initially within parallel bars {{as the most}} stable assistive device. As walking improves, a patient can progress to a walker, crutches, bilateral canes or a single cane. This gait training typically occurs during physical therapy sessions. The more recent development of body-weight support gait training, such as over a treadmill, can enable considerably more walking practice with less strain to the therapist, when compared to traditional gait training.|$|R
25|$|Regular {{physical}} exercise {{with or without}} physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking {{have been found to}} decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to <b>gait</b> during <b>rehabilitation</b> programs include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).|$|R
50|$|Gait {{training}} or <b>gait</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> is {{the act of}} learning how to walk, either as a child, or, more frequently, after sustaining an injury or disability. Physical therapists, or physiotherapists, generally help their patients with gait training.|$|E

40|$|Background: Auditory-visual cueing using {{portable}} cueing devices {{has been}} effective for <b>gait</b> training in <b>rehabilitation</b> programs with Parkinson patients. However, {{it is possible that}} some gait problems arise due to interference from chronic high frequency stimulation with the gait and balance neural networks in PD patients. Thus, it should be useful to test whether advanced PD patients experiencing gait problems (despite the treatment with medication and high frequen-cy deep brain stimulation- DBS) would benefit from therapy using cueing. Methods: Eyeglasses combining auditory-visual cueing were worn by 18 patients with advanced PD and treated with medication and deep brain stimulation.

50|$|There is some {{evidence}} that rhythmic auditory stimulation is beneficial in <b>gait</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> following a brain injury.

50|$|Gait {{variability}} seen in Parkinson's Disorders arise due to cortical changes {{induced by}} pathophysiology {{of the disease}} process. <b>Gait</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> is focused to harness the adapted connections involved actively to control these variations during the disease progression.

5000|$|Robotic {{lower limb}} exoskeletons have the {{potential}} to help an individual recover from an injury such as a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disabilities. Neurological motor disorders often result in reduced volitional muscle activation amplitude, impaired proprioception, and disordered muscle coordination; a robotic exoskeleton with proportional myoelectric control can improve all three of these by amplifying the relationship between muscle activation and proprioceptive feedback. By increasing the consequences of muscle activation, an exoskeleton can improve sensory feedback in a physiological way, which in turn can improve motor control Individuals with spinal cord injury or who have had a stroke can improve their motor capabilities through intense <b>gait</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual.

Methods: An auditory feedback cue, responding to the patient's own steps in closed-loop, was produced by a wearable motion sensor and delivered to the patient through ear phones. On-line (device on) and residual short-term therapeutic effects on walking speed and stride length were measured in fourteen randomly selected patients with gait disturbances predominantly due to cerebellar ataxia. Results: Patients showed an average improvement of 12. 84 % on-line and 18. 75 % residually in walking speed. Average improvement in stride length was 8. 30 % on-line and 9. 93 % residually.

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} construction {{should offer}} assistance in leg {{movements in the}} forward directionand in keeping lateral balance.

These robots use joint trajectories of the entire gait cycle andoffer a uniform (more or less) stiff control along this trajectory.

[Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the effects of accuracy constraints (targets) placed on the stepping-limb heel-strike (HS) on the electromyogram (EMG) and ground reaction forces (GRFs) during gait initiation. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty healthy subjects (29. 2 ± 2. 9 years) were asked to begin walking or stepping over a 10 -cm-high obstacle at a fast speed. A 3 -cm-diameter target {{was placed on the}} ground to dictate the position and accuracy of the stepping-limb HS. [Results] The results showed that the initiation velocity increase in the no-target conditions was due to modulation of the stance- and stepping-limb GRFs and a corresponding increase in the tibialis anterior (TA) activities of both limbs before stepping-limb toe-off. This was achieved by significantly increasing the stepping- and stance-limb TAEMG 1 (determined between the onset of movement and time to peak anteroposterior (A-P) GRF of the stepping- and stance- limb) for the no-target conditions. It seems, therefore, that TAEMG 1 and the slope to stepping-limb peak A-P GRF contributed to the intended velocity of initiation. [Conclusion] These data indicate that gait initiation and/or stepping over an obstacle may prove to be tasks by which motor control can be measured. The present study provides insight into the working mechanisms of the stepping and stance limbs and shows a clear need to further investigate whether the intact or affected limb should be used to initiate <b>gait</b> during <b>rehabilitation</b> and prosthetic training...|$|R

30|$|A {{keystone}} in {{the implementation}} of the classic Ilizarov technique over some conventional techniques of fracture fixation is early functional loading of the limb as distinct to early functional use. A considerable body of literature attests to the importance of functional loading (weight bearing) in promoting fracture healing; by minimising the size of the fracture gap and reducing torsional and sheer stresses while allowing small amounts of axial strain, physiological loading of the bone in the immediate post-operative period can significantly reduce the time taken for healing to occur and reduce the incidence of delayed or non-union [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Early loading also preserves muscle tone, proprioceptive sensation and <b>gait,</b> thereby optimising <b>rehabilitation.</b> Follow-up studies of patients who have had leg-lengthening procedures show that the recovery of knee range of movement is excellent in the long term, although patients with congenital leg length discrepancies tend to do slightly worse [14, 15].|$|R
