40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} modifying epoxy resin using phenol-nonyl phenol based polymer (PNPF) for toughness improvement and optimise the results of such a modification. Design/methodology/approach – For effective toughening, various compositions were made by incorporating PNPF at different concentrations. The <b>impact</b> and <b>adhesive</b> strengths of the unmodified and modified epoxy networks were characterised. Findings – The modification of epoxy resin using PNPF showed significant enhancement of <b>impact</b> and <b>adhesive</b> strengths over the unmodified one. The modification caused {{the formation of a}} chemical linkage between PNPF and resin which led not only to a phase separation, but also to formation of intrinsically strong chemical bonds across the PNPF phase/resin matrix interphase, which was the main cause of the improved <b>impact</b> and <b>adhesive</b> strengths. The optimum results were obtained at 10 phr (parts per 100 parts of epoxy resin) of modifier. Research limitations/implications – The modifier, PNPF, used in the present context was synthesised from phenol, nonyl phenol and formalin using oxalic acid as catalyst. Practical implications – The developed method provided a simple and practical solution to improving the toughness of a cured epoxy. Originality/value – The method for enhancing toughness of a cured epoxy was novel and could find numerous applications in the surface coating and adhesive...|$|R

Cell-cell junctions are critical for maintaining basement membranes and the integrity of epithelial layers.

Several EMT activators act either jointly or independently on each of these cell contact mediators and their impact on cell-cell junctions is nearly the same regardless of cell type [5]. The importance of factors on the cell surface to EMT is further illustrated by recent findings illustrating that alterations in the glycosylation of cell surface glycoproteins <b>impacts</b> cellular <b>adhesive</b> properties.

The degree of {{swelling}} or expansion depends {{on the type of}} adhesive used, its share, and the time of exposure and pressure used at hot pressing.

A laboratory model system was designed using a dextran gel as a biofilm surrogate and a typodont model was used to reproduce the geometry of the mouth. Using uni-axial compression, the elastic modulus of Streptococcus mutans biofilms was 0. 280 kPa (± 0. 350; n= 30), and the relaxation time was 11 s (± 12; n= 10). The type of surface, concentration of sugar, chelation and osmotic pressure all had significant effects on biofilm stiffness. However, there was no direct relationship between biofilm stiffness and surface hydrophobicity or roughness. The elastic modulus of the gel was 17 kPa (± 12; n= 3), and the relaxation time was 15 s (± 12; n= 3) which was in the reported viscoelastic range of real bacterial biofilms. High velocity 115 ?L water drops travelling with an exit velocity of 60 m/s were generated using a prototype interdental cleaning device (Sonicare AirFloss).

Model fissures were created in bovine enamel fragments (n = 10) and sealed {{using one of the}} following protocols: no adhesive system + photoactivation of the sealant using continuous light (CL), no adhesive system + photoactivation of the sealant using the soft-start method (SS), HR + CL, or HR + SS. Marginal and internal gaps and KHN were assessed after storage in water for 24 h. The CLD was indirectly assessed by repeating the KHN measurement after 24 h of immersion in 100 % ethanol. There was no difference among the samples with regard to marginal or internal adaptation. The KHN and CLD were similar for samples cured using either photoactivation method.

40|$|Adhesive bond-line {{read-through}} is {{the terminology}} {{used in the}} automotive industry that describes a visible distortion of an adherent over the adhesive bond-line. Usually, this {{is a result of}} the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the substrates and the adhesive. First of all, previous work is presented, as well as some information about the terms that are used throughout the project. A linear thermal simulation is carried out in order to analyse the bond-line read-through curvature defects produced by the adhesive properties in a typical bonding from the automotive industry.

40|$|High {{velocity}} impact between crystalline surfaces {{is important}} {{for a range of}} material phenomena, yet a fundamental understanding of the effect of surface structure, energetics and kinetics on the underlying thermo-mechanical response remains elusive. Here, we employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to describe the nanoscale dynamics of the high velocity impact between commensurate and incommensurate monocrystalline (001) copper surfaces. For impact velocities in the range 100 - 1200 m/s, the kinetic energy dissipation involves nucleation and emission of dislocation loops from defective sites within the rapidly forming interface, well below the bulk single-crystal yield point. At higher velocities, adiabatic dissipation occurs via plasticity-induced heating as the interface structurally melts following the <b>impact.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> strength of the reformed interface is controlled by the formation and nucleation of dislocations and point defects as they modify the interfacial energy relative to the deformed bulk. As confirmation, the excess interface energy decreases monotonically with increasing impact velocity. The relative crystal orientation of the surfaces equally important; the grain boundaries formed following incommensurate impact exhibit higher impact resistance, with smaller defect densities and interfacial enthalpies, suggesting an enhanced ability of the grain boundaries to absorb the non-equilibrium damage and therefore facilitate particle bonding. Our study highlights the key role played by the atomic-scale surface structure in determining the impact resistance and adhesion of crystalline surfaces. Comment: 13 figures, 23 page...|$|R

From the results of experiment it was proved on five tested two-component epoxy adhesives that the negative effect of the peeling forces can be reduced by mechanical treatment of the adhesive bonded surface e. g. blasting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the <b>impact</b> of <b>adhesive</b> capsulitis on costs and health and to compare the cost-utility of high-grade and low-grade mobilisation techniques. In a randomised controlled trial, 92 patients with adhesive capsulitis received either high-grade mobilisation techniques or low-grade mobilisation techniques and were followed for one year. Outcome measures were quality adjusted life years (QALYs) according to the Short Form 6 D (SF- 6 D) and societal costs estimated from cost questionnaires. Estimated costs and QALYs in both randomisation groups were similar, except for the number of treatment sessions (18. 6 for high-grade mobilisation techniques versus 21. 5 for low-grade mobilisation techniques), with an estimated cost difference of € 105 in favour of high-grade mobilisation techniques (p = 0. 001, 95 % CI € 43 to € 158). In the entire sample, the average valuation of health improved from 0. 597 at baseline to 0. 745 after a year. The burden due to adhesive capsulitis was estimated at 0. 048 QALY and € 4, 521 per patient. About half these costs were due to absenteeism which, during the first quarter, amounted to 38 % of the total working hours. In conclusion, the cost-utility analysis does not allow for an evidence-based recommendation on the preferred treatment. Based on the clinical outcome measures, high-grade mobilisation techniques are still preferred to low-grade mobilisation techniques. The estimated substantial burden, both to the patient and to society, suggests that effective early treatment of adhesive capsulitis is warranted to attempt to accelerate recovery...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is devoted}} to the Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique, a discontinuum {{modelling}} approach that takes into account the fact that granular materials are composed of discrete particles which interact with each other at the microscale level. This numerical simulation technique can be used both for dispersed systems in which the particle-particle interactions are collisional and compact systems of particles with multiple enduring contacts. The book provides an extensive and detailed explanation of the theoretical background of DEM. Contact mechanics theories for elastic, elastic-plastic, adhesive elastic and adhesive elastic-plastic particle-particle interactions are presented. Other contact force models are also discussed, including corrections to some of these models as described in the literature, and important areas of further research are identified. A key issue in DEM simulations is whether or not a code can reliably simulate the simplest of systems, namely the single particle oblique impact with a wall. This is discussed using the output obtained from the contact force models described earlier, which are compared for elastic and inelastic collisions.  In addition, further insight is provided for the <b>impact</b> of <b>adhesive</b> particles. The author then moves on to provide the results of selected DEM applications to agglomerate impacts, fluidised beds and quasi-static deformation, demonstrating that the DEM technique can be used (i) to mimic experiments, (ii) explore parameter sweeps, including limiting values, or (iii) identify new, previously unknown, phenomena at the microscale. In the DEM applications the emphasis is on discovering new information that enhances our rational understanding of particle systems, which may be more significant than developing a new continuum model that encompasses all microstructural aspects, which would most likely prove too complicated for practical implementation.  The book will be of interest to academic and industrial researchers working in particle technology/process engineering and geomechanics, both experimentalists and theoreticians...|$|R

Since the wait time {{is integral to}} the value created by the process, {{it can be difficult}} to reduce the cycle time impact. The use of <b>adhesives</b> and the <b>impact</b> of their associated cure times is an example of such a time-dependent process and one that appears frequently on products made at Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems (SAS). Using a typical Raytheon pod system (RPS) as a case study, this thesis examines various ways to mitigate the impact of these value-added associated wait times (VAAWT) on cycle time. Adhesives with long cure and/or set times are used extensively throughout the design of this RPS in both structural and non-structural applications. Now that the RPS is well into full-rate production, the cycle time impact of these adhesives' VAAWT has become a burden, accounting for over 60 % of the cycle time on the three assemblies studied on during the case study. Both short-term and long-term solutions were developed as a result of this project, which enabled a 23 % reduction in cycle time exclusive of changes in design. (cont.) Based upon the lessons learned during this case study, a set of guidelines is presented for application to other time-dependent processes and Raytheon products.

The effect of the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to the adhesive was also studied. The effects of the MWNTs' diameter, length, concentration and functional group were also investigated. It was demonstrated that an adhesive joint with greater strength than a similarly constructed scarf joint can be created. It was further shown that the addition of MWNTs to the adhesive increased the Mode II fracture strength of the adhesive for a steelcomposite and composite-composite joints. It was also shown that the fracture path shifted from through the adhesive when no nanotubes were present to between the adhesive and metal or composite interface {{with the addition of}} nanotubes. The concentration, diameter, length and functionalization of the MWNTs added to the adhesive {{played a significant role in}} the strength of the joint. Not all nanotubes improved joint strength.

40|$|The {{impact of}} elastic spheres in {{presence}} of adhesion {{has been extensively}} studied due to its wide-ranging significance. A major emphasis of such studies is the energy loss occurring during impacts. Energy loss due to elastic stress waves is of special significance, {{as it could be}} the only active energy loss mechanism in many cases. In this work, we use finite element method to study the impact of elastic spheres on a rigid half-space in presence of adhesion. Adhesion, caused by van der Waals force, is modeled as a body force. This formulation helps to avoid many of the restrictions imposed by the commonly-used surface-force model of adhesion. The energy loss in <b>adhesive</b> <b>impact</b> of elastic spheres is predominantly due to the stress waves caused by adhesion-induced instability, which is absent below a critical sphere radius. Therefore, the coefficient of restitution increases with increase in sphere radius below this critical value, while it shows a reducing trend above it, within the range of sphere radii considered in this study. Therefore, our study indicates that the variation of critical velocity for capture with sphere radius will not be monotonic, unlike presented in many of the previous studies. (C) 2017 The Authors.

40|$|Armor {{used for}} {{ballistic}} protection applications {{is driven by}} three main factors: protection level, system weight, and cost. Engineered ceramic armors are an attractive option over metallic systems {{because of the potential}} for weight reduction; however, large tiles of high-strength, monolithic ceramic are significantly more expensive than the metallic counterpart for an equivalent protection level. Ceramics also tend to fail catastrophically during impact, leading to secondary cracking and shrapnel, affecting the viability {{of the rest of the}} armor system and posing significant risks to personnel. Biological ceramic systems, such as those found in mollusks and crustaceans, incorporate relatively low-strength ceramics into complex structures. These assemblies reportedly exhibit greater damage tolerance over equivalent volumes of monolithic ceramics. Key microstructural elements of natural organo-ceramic systems were identified, adapted, and incorporated into a macro scale composite design. Two variants, one using a rigid adhesive and another with a flexible adhesive, were constructed and tested for flexure and <b>impact.</b> The flexible <b>adhesive</b> design reliably exhibited at least 10 times greater energy absorption over monolithic control samples and could be repeatedly struck in the same location at impact loads that caused catastrophic failure in the control samples.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been demonstrated that cell shape can influence commitment of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMCs) to adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, and other lineages. Human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs) exhibit multipotency similar to hBMCs, but hPDCs may offer enhanced potential for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis given their apparent endogenous role in bone and cartilage repair in vivo. Here, we examined whether hPDC differentiation is regulated by adhesive and mechanical cues comparable to that reported for hBMC differentiation. When cultured in the appropriate induction media, hPDCs at high cell seeding density demonstrated enhanced levels of adipogenic or chondrogenic markers as compared with hPDCs at low cell seeding density. Cell seeding density correlated inversely with projected area of cell spreading, and directly limiting cell spreading with micropatterned substrates promoted adipogenesis or chondrogenesis while substrates promoting cell spreading supported osteogenesis. Interestingly, cell seeding density influenced differentiation through both changes in cell shape and non-shape-mediated effects: density-dependent adipogenesis and chondrogenesis were regulated primarily by cell shape whereas non-shape effects strongly influenced osteogenic potential. Inhibition of cytoskeletal contractility by adding the Rho kinase inhibitor Y 27632 further enhanced adipogenic differentiation and discouraged osteogenic differentiation of hPDCs. Together, our results suggest that multipotent lineage decisions of hPDCs are <b>impacted</b> by cell <b>adhesive</b> and mechanical cues, though to different extents than hBMCs. Thus, future studies of hPDCs and other primary stem cell populations with clinical potential should consider varying biophysical metrics for more thorough optimization of stem cell differentiation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Accruing {{evidence}} indicates that the levels of extracellular Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + can have a distinct <b>impact</b> on the <b>adhesive</b> and migratory activities of many cell types. The physiological relevance of these observations, however, has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, wound fluids collected throughout {{the early stages of}} cutaneous wound repair were examined for possible Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + fluctuations. Early in the process, when cell migration into the wound site is initiated, Mg 2 + is elevated and Ca 2 + is reduced (Mg 2 +:Ca 2 + = 1). As wound healing progresses, wound fluid concentrations of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + begin to return to normal plasma levels (Mg 2 +:Ca 2 + = 0. 4). When macrophages, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were exposed to dialyzed wound fluid, the migration stimulated by undialyzed wound fluid was lost. Addition back to dialyzed wound fluid of 24 h, postinjury concentrations of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + restored all migratory stimulus. This observed migration is approximately twofold greater than when normal plasma Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + concentrations are present. Changes in the levels of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + in wound fluid occur during the same period that inflammatory cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and neovasculature have been shown to migrate during wound healing in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the impact of these changes on integrins and E-cadherin may play a direct role in the activation and maintenance of the migratory phenotypes of the cells involved in the wound healing process...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveConstrictive {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes significantly to restenosis after arterial reconstruction, but its molecular regulation is poorly defined. Hyaluronan (HA) accumulates within ECM at sites of injury {{where it is}} thought to facilitate smooth muscle cell (SMC) trafficking and collagen remodeling analogous to its role in cutaneous wound healing. SMC receptors for HA include receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), which mediates HA-induced migration. We hypothesized RHAMM would also mediate SMC-matrix interactions to alter the extent of constrictive remodeling. MethodsWe studied the role of RHAMM in SMC attachment to collagen, migration, and contraction of collagen gels using blocking antibodies and SMC from RHAMM −/− knockout mice. We then determined the role of RHAMM in constrictive artery wall remodeling by comparing changes in wall geometry in RHAMM −/− vs wild-type (WT) RHAMM +/+ controls 1 month after carotid ligation. ResultsHA increased SMC attachment to collagen-coated plates, but blocking RHAMM reduced adhesion (P =. 025). RHAMM −/− SMC also demonstrated reduced adhesion (% adherent: 36. 1  ± 2. 2 vs 76. 3  ± 1. 9; P <. 05). SMC contraction of collagen gels was enhanced by HA and further increased by RHAMM blockade (P <. 01) or knockout (gel diameter, mm: RHAMM −/−, 6. 7  ± 0. 1 vs WT 9. 8  ± 0. 1; P <. 01). RHAMM promoted constrictive remodeling in vivo as carotid artery size was significantly larger in knockout mice 1 month after ligation. Neointimal thickening, however, was not affected in RHAMM −/− (P = NS vs WT), but lumen size was significantly larger (lumen area, μm 2 : 52. 4  ± 1. 4  × 103 vs 10. 4  ± 1. 8  × 103; P =. 01) because artery size constricted less (external elastic lamina area, μm 2 : RHAMM −/−, 92. 4  ± 4. 7  × 103 vs WT, 51. 3  ± 5. 9  × 103; P =. 015). Adventitial thickening and collagen deposition were also more extensive in ligated RHAMM −/− carotids (adventitial thickness, μm: 218  ± 12. 2 vs 109  ± 7. 9; P =. 01). ConclusionsHA activation of RHAMM significantly <b>impacts</b> SMC-ECM <b>adhesive</b> interactions and contributes to constrictive artery wall remodeling in mice. Strategies to block RHAMM at sites of vessel injury may prove useful {{in the prevention of}} clinical restenosis. Clinical RelevanceConstrictive (inward) remodeling is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of restenosis following artery injury. Presently, no effective treatment has been developed to prevent constrictive remodeling in patients except a metal stent. In this study, we demonstrated that receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) interacts with hyaluronan and regulates smooth muscle cell attachment, motility, and remodeling of {{extracellular matrix}} in vitro. In a mouse carotid ligation model, we found that RHAMM promotes constrictive artery wall remodeling and lumen narrowing, as knockout of RHAMM significantly improves wall caliber and prevents lumen stenosis. These results suggested that pharmacological inhibitors of RHAMM or approaches to block RHAMM signaling could be effective components of a multimodal strategy to prevent restenosis following arterial reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance, {{repair and}} {{overhaul}} {{companies have been}} reporting corrosion failure events in the Airbus A 320 CFM 56 - 5 b intakes. These intakes {{are attached to the}} power plant frame by a dissimilar material bonded joint, where liquid shim adhesive is used to avoid the dielectric formation between dissimilar materials. In previous works, the authors reported that the A 320 intakes corrosion {{is a result of the}} adhesive inability to avoid the dielectric formation, which is a result of micro-cracks formation within the adhesive layer. The main reason that lead to these cracks is the adhesive aging and thermal cycling at very low temperatures, which quite often reach values lower than - 50 ºC. This paper studies the effect of negative thermal loading on dissimilar materials bonded joints. Two epoxy adhesives are studied and compared, namely the Hysol EA- 934, which is the adhesive currently used in the A 320 Airbus intakes, and the Hysol EA- 9394, a second generation adhesive candidate to replace the actual adhesive. A numerical study was performed in order to simulate the adhesive joint using a finite element analysis commercial package, where several hypotheses were explored. These hypotheses where focused on the effects of several factors on the adhesive layer stress distribution. Factors such as temperature range, boundary conditions, variation of the coefficient of thermal expansion with temperature, and interfacial cracks between the adhesive layer and dissimilar adherend materials were analyzed. Results show that very low temperatures have a negative <b>impact</b> on the <b>adhesives</b> strength and micro-cracks formation may result from thermal loads below zero degrees Celsius, even for adhesives without any aging. Moreover, low temperatures in dissimilar materials bonded joints may create stress states that surpass the adhesive lap shear strength. Some conclusions are drawn regarding adhesive selection for dissimilar materials bonded joints in order to overcome these issues.

40|$|Controlling the {{specific}} adhesive properties of surfaces is a technologically complex challenge that has piqued {{the interest of}} many research groups around the world. While many scientists have used complex topographic and chemically altered surfaces to tune adhesion, others have shown that naturally occurring phenomena, such as elastic instabilities, can impact adhesion. We provide a thorough investigation into the effects of periodic surface buckling instabilities, or wrinkles, on adhesion. Wrinkles are an attractive surface patterning alternative as they form spontaneously over large areas and their dimensions, namely wavelength and amplitude, can be controlled on length scales relevant for adhesion control. We focus {{on the development of}} fundamental relationships that relate wrinkle adhesion to materials properties and topographic feature geometry. To accomplish this goal, we first investigate the separation of a flat rigid punch from a single elastic cylinder, which models the separation of a single wrinkle. The knowledge gained from this study is then utilized to develop a scaling expression relating adherence force to wrinkle geometry, materials properties, and testing geometry. This scaling theory is validated by varying these parameters systematically in a series of model wrinkle adhesion experiments. Added complexity in the form of varied crosslinker density, which alters the ratio of storage to loss moduli, and geometric confinement effects on wrinkle adhesion are then studied. Finally, a novel technique for fabricating biaxial wrinkles with two independently-adjusted wavelengths is developed, adding an additional parameter which can be tuned to further control adhesion. ^ A single elastic cylinder was probed with a finite rigid flat probe, allowing the separation mechanism of a single 2 ̆ 2 macro 2 ̆ 2 scale wrinkle to be determined. Rather than a long cylinder contact mechanism, which has been utilized in describing wrinkle adhesion mechanisms in the past, an elliptical contact area approximation was found to more appropriately describe the single cylinder adhesion data. ^ To consider the impact of an array of cylinders on adhesion, a model wrinkle system comprised of an elastomeric foundation and chemically-simple polymer film was developed. The wrinkle wavelength, amplitude, substrate modulus, and probe radius were varied, and the normal adhesive response of each aligned wrinkled surface was determined. Overall, wrinkles were found to decrease the separation force relative to a smooth surface and the separation force varied inversely with the square root of a wrinkle dimension, either wavelength or amplitude. ^ The effects of viscoelasticity on the adhesion of a wrinkled substrate that is geometrically confined was studied. Wrinkled surface features were molded onto the surface of a rigid cylindrical probe, and the normal adhesion of these probes contacting thin elastomeric films fabricated with varying crosslinker concentrations was measured. The materials-defined length scale relating adhesion energy and modulus controlled the wrinkle feature sizes that <b>impacted</b> the <b>adhesive</b> response of each smooth film. In the most highly crosslinked films, small wrinkles increased both the separation force and adhesion energy of the interface two-fold, while large wrinkles reduced adhesion to almost nothing. ^ Capitalizing on knowledge gained in the fabrication of many wrinkled surfaces, a novel technique for fabricating biaxial wrinkles was developed. Aligned wrinkles were formed on a partially crosslinked substrate, the modulus of the substrate was increased by allowing the material to crosslink completely, and a mechanical compressive strain was then imposed orthogonal to the primary wrinkle direction. This process resulted in the formation of biaxial wrinkled surfaces with two distinct, independently controlled lateral dimensions or wavelengths. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} deformation mechanisms and responsiveness {{associated with the}} wrinkling, folding, and snapping of thin polymer films. We demonstrated the use of elastic instabilities in confined regimes, such as the crumpling and snapping of surface attached sheets. We gained fundatmental insight into a thin film 2 ̆ 7 s ability to localize strain. By taking advantage of geometric strain localization {{we were able to}} develop new strategies for responsive surfaces that will have a broad <b>impact</b> on <b>adhesive,</b> optical, and patterning applications. ^ Using the rapid closure of the Venus flytrap 2 ̆ 7 s leaflets as dictated by the onset of a snap instability as motivation, we created surfaces with patterned structures to transition through a snap instability at a prescribed stress state. This mechanism causes surface topography to change over large lateral length scales and very short timescales. Changes in the stress state can be related to triggers such as chemical swelling, light-induced architecture transitions, mechanical pressure, or voltage. The primary advantages of the snap transition are that the magnitude of change, the rate of change, and the sensitivity to change can be dictated by a balance of materials properties and geometry. The patterned structures that exhibit these dynamics are elastomeric shells that geometrically localize strain and can snap between concave and convex curvatures. We have demonstrated the control of the microlens shell geometry and that the transition time follows scaling relationships presented for the Venus flytrap. Furthermore, the microlens arrays have been demonstrated as surfaces that can alter wettability. ^ Using a similar novel processing technique, microarrays of freestanding elastomeric plates were placed in equibiaxial compression to fabricate crumpled morphologies with strain localized regions that are difficult to attain through traditional patterning techniques. The microstructures that form can be initially described using classical plate buckling theory for circular plates under an applied compressive strain. Upon the application of increasing compressive strain, axisymmetric microstructures undergo a secondary bifurcation into highly curved, nonaxisymmetric structures. The inherent interplay between geometry and strain in these systems provides a mechanism for generating responsiveness in the structures. By swelling the elastomeric plates with a compatible solvent, we demonstrated the microstructures ability to reversibly switch between axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric geometries. ^ To further explore the localization of strain in materials, we have fabricated sharply folded films of glassy, homogenous polymers directly on rigid substrates. The films were uniaxially compressed and buckle after delaminating from the substrate. As the applied strain is increased, we observed strain localization {{at the center of the}} delaminated features. We found that normally brittle, polystyrene films can accommodate excessive compressive strains without fracture by undergoing these strain localizing fold events. This technique provided a unique way to examine the curvature and stability of folded features, but was not adequate for understanding the onset of folding. ^ By taking thin films, either glassy or elastomeric, and simply lifting them from the surface of water, we observed and quantified the wrinkle-to-fold transition in an axisymmetric geometry. The films initially wrinkle as they are lifted with a wavelength that is determined by the film thickness and material properties. The wrinkle-to-fold transition is analogous to the transition observed in uniaxially compressed films, but the axisymmetric geometry caused the fold to act as a disclination that increased the radial stress in the film, thereby decreasing the wavelength of the remaining wrinkles. Further straining the films caused the remaining wrinkles to collapse into a discrete number of folds that is independent of film thickness and material properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Release liners {{are used}} in various {{self-adhesive}} applications such as hygiene products (feminine care and diapers), envelopes, labels, etc. The main function of the release liner {{is to protect the}} adhesive layer in the product. Release liner has to stick to the adhesive, but also be easily removed from it. Therefore, the optimal level of release force needed to peel off the release liner is important for the proper performance of the liner. Release liner consists usually of base paper, precoating, and silicone coating. Silicone offers easy release, but it is the most expensive part of the release liner. Precoating makes the paper surface smoother and allows the use of a thinner silicone layer. The properties of the base paper, such as roughness and porosity, as well as the properties of the precoating and silicone coating, such as coating coverage, affect the final performance of the release liner. In addition to the factors directly related to the release liner, the release performance is affected by other factors such as the adhesive, the face stock material and the peel speed and angle. For a release liner manufacturer, {{it is important to know}} well all the factors that affect the performance of the release liner in the final product. In this work, influence of base paper porosity, precoating and silicone amount of the release liner as well as <b>impact</b> of different <b>adhesives</b> on the release force were investigated. In the theoretical part of the work, the phenomenon of adhesion is introduced with the help of general adhesion theories, continued with the concept of practical adhesion, or the practical strength of the adhesive bond, with contributions of fundamental adhesion and energy dissipation in the peeling process. Then, the materials involved in the study are introduced starting from the base paper, precoating and silicone, and continuing with pressure-sensitive adhesives. For the experimental part of the work, release liner samples were prepared with a base paper of 3 different levels of porosity coated with a hand coater using 2 levels of precoating and 3 levels of silicone coating. Air permeance values (closely related to the porosity), coat weights, water contact angles, and surface roughness were determined for the release liner samples. Six commercial adhesives intended for release liner applications were then characterized by their rheological properties. Release tests were then performed for the 18 different release liner samples and 6 different adhesives. It was found that the porosity of the base paper at the porosity level used did not have strong influence, but paper with lower porosity would allow the use of lower level of precoating. The level of precoating and silicone coating expectedly had a significant influence on the release performance with a higher level of precoating allowing less silicone to be used. Unexpectedly, a clear correlation between the rheological properties of the adhesive and the release force was not found. Commercial adhesives intended for the same purpose (hygiene products) gave similar release forces...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{fabrication}} of dry adhesives mimicking gecko adhesion. We also {{look into the}} origin of the supreme adhesion of geckos, which have inspired the fabrication of fibrillar dry adhesives during the last decade or so. In principle, the superior material properties of β-keratin (the main material comprising the fibrillar feature on gecko toe pads) along with the hierarchical high aspect-ratio fibrillar structure of geckos’ foot pad have enabled geckos to stick readily and rapidly to almost any surface in both dry and wet conditions. In this research, non-sticky fluoropolymer (Teflon AF) resembling β-keratin rigidity and having an extremely low surface energy and dielectric constant was applied to fabricate a novel dry adhesive consisting of extremely high aspect-ratio nanopillars (200 nm in diameter) terminated with a fluffy top nanolayer. Both the nanopillars and the terminating layer were fabricated concurrently by replica-molding using a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide membrane as the mold. In particular, upon infiltration of Teflon AF melt into the anodic aluminum oxide nanopores, the polymer melt fingered over the pore walls. The fingerlike structure formed during infiltration, subsequently collapsed after removal of the mold, developing a unique sheet-like nanostructure on top of the base nanopillars. Concurrent fabrication of the terminating nanostructure helps the fabrication of extremely high aspect-ratio (27. 5 – 225) nanopillars which, up to an aspect-ratio of 185, neither collapse at the tip nor bundle. In order to fabricate nanopillars of different topographical properties, in our first approach, the height of the nanopillars as well as the size and density of the terminating nanostructure are carefully controlled by adjusting the processing temperature. Following that, a novel replica-molding technique for fabrication of bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars is reported. The developed technique relies on the concurrent heating and cooling of the Teflon AF melt which filled vertically-aligned alumina nanochannels. Unlike conventional polymer infiltration methods which consist of filling the mold by only heating the polymer above its glass transition temperature, in our novel method, the polymer melt is also simultaneously cooled down during the infiltration process. Concurrent cooling of the Teflon AF melt allows control over the interfacial instabilities of the polymer thin film, which forms ahead of the polymer melt upon its infiltration into the alumina nanochannels. Doing so, the geometrical properties of the subsequently developed peculiar fluffy nanostructure – after removal of the mold – on top of the extremely high aspect-ratio Teflon AF nanopillars (~ 25 µm tall) are modified. In this project, we have also shown that the adhesion of the fabricated dry adhesives for the most part arises from electrostatic interactions of the applied polymer. In other words, Teflon AF, having an exceptional potential for developing electric charges at its surface upon contact with other materials via the so-called contact electrification phenomenon, can develop significant electrostatic interactions at its surface upon contact. In the current thesis, tribological results were discussed in detail to clarify the contribution of the structural properties of the fabricated dry adhesives toward their remarkable adhesion and friction forces generated via contact electrification. Nanopillars of specific geometrical properties have achieved remarkable adhesion and friction strengths, up to ~ 2. 1 N/cm 2 and 17 N/cm 2, respectively (up to ~ 2. 1 and 1. 7 times larger than those of a gecko toe pad). It is commonly accepted that the adhesive performance of other synthetic bio-inspired dry adhesives is due to the formation of van der Waals interactions at the tip or side of the dry adhesives fibrils with the substrate they are brought into contact with. However, what has been usually neglected in this connection is that electrostatic interactions may also be developed at the contact between any two materials via the familiar contact electrification phenomenon. Although contact electrification is common and can have a large influence on interfacial interaction forces, its <b>impact</b> on <b>adhesive</b> properties of synthetic dry adhesives has been overlooked. Our results on adhesion of bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars, which can generate strong adhesion forces relying on electrostatic interactions arising from contact electrification, have brought to light again the idea that charging the surface of dry adhesives, specifically polymeric ones, can play a very crucial role in their adhesive behavior. From this perspective, the main reasons that have caused this lack of attention to this concept and the possible contributions of contact electrification to interfacial interactions of polymeric dry adhesives, other than bi-level Teflon AF nanopillars, are also thoroughly discussed in this thesis. Besides synthetic fibrillar dry adhesives, the possibility of the occurrence of contact electrification and its contribution to the supreme dry adhesion of geckos have also been overlooked for several decades. In this research, by the simultaneous measurement of electric charges and adhesion forces that gecko toe pads develop on two distinct substrates (a sticky and a non-sticky one), we have shown that the toe pads generate significantly large amounts of electric charge on both substrates. More importantly, we have found that there is a direct correlation between the contact electrification-driven electrostatic forces and the measured adhesion forces. Otherwise stated, we have shown that what makes the difference that geckos stick strongly to one surface and not to the other are the electrostatic interactions arising from contact electrification, and not van der Waals interactions, which have been considered as the prime source of adhesion of geckos for many years...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the buckling deformation mechanisms of bending, wrinkling, and folding that {{occur on the}} surfaces and interfaces of polymer systems. We gained fundamental insight into the formation mechanism of these buckled structures for thin glassy films placed on an elastomeric substrate. By taking advantage of geometric confinement, we demonstrated new strategies in controlling wrinkling morphologies. We were able to achieve surfaces with controlled patterned structures which will have a broad <b>impact</b> in optical, <b>adhesive,</b> microelectronics, and microfluidics applications. Wrinkles and strain localized features, such as delaminations and folds, are observed in many natural systems and are useful {{for a wide range}} of patterning applications. However, the transition from sinusoidal wrinkles to more complex strain localized structures is not well understood. We investigated the onset of wrinkling and strain localizations under uniaxial strain. We show that careful measurement of feature amplitude allowed not only the determination of wrinkle, fold, or delamination onset, but also allowed clear distinction between each feature. The folds observed in this experiment have an outward morphology from the surface in contrast to folds that form into the plane, as observed in a film floating on a liquid substrate. A critical strain map was constructed, where the critical strain was measured experimentally for wrinkling, folding, and delamination with varying film thickness and modulus. Wrinkle morphologies, i. e. amplitude and wavelength of wrinkles, affect properties such as electron transport in stretchable electronics and adhesion properties of smart surfaces. To gain an understanding of how the wrinkle morphology can be controlled, we introduced a geometrical confinement in the form of rigid boundaries. Upon straining, we found that wrinkles started near the rigid boundaries where maximum local strain occurred and propagated towards the middle as more global strain was applied. In contrast to homogeneous wrinkling with constant amplitude that is observed for an unconfined system, the wrinkling observed here had varying amplitude as a function of distance from the rigid boundaries. We demonstrated that the number of wrinkles can be tuned by controlling the distance between the rigid boundaries. Location of wrinkles was also controlled by introducing local stress distributions via patterning the elastomeric substrate. Two distinct wrinkled regions were achieved on a surface where the film is free-standing over a circular hole pattern and where the film is supported by the substrate. The hoe diameter and applied strain affected the wavelength and amplitude of the free-standing membrane. Using discontinuous dewetting, a one-step fabrication method was developed to selectively deposit a small volume of liquid in patterned microwells and encapsulate it with a polymeric film. The pull-out velocity, a velocity at which the sample is removed from a bath of liquid, was controlled to observe how encapsulation process is affected. The polymeric film was observed to wrinkle at low pull-out velocity due to no encapsulation of liquid; whereas the film bent at medium pull-out velocity due to capillary effect as the liquid evaporated through the film. To quantify the amount of liquid encapsulated, we mixed salt in water and measured the size of the deposited salt crystals. The salt crystal size, and hence the amount of liquid encapsulated, was controlled by varying either the encapsulation velocity or the size of the patterned microwells. In addition, we showed that the deposited salt crystals are protected by the laminated film until the film is removed, providing advantageous control for delivery and release. Yeast cells were also captured in the microwells to show the versatility. This encapsulation method is useful for wide range of applications, such as trapping single cells for biological studies, growing microcrystals for optical and magnetic applications, and single-use sensor technologies. ...|$|R
