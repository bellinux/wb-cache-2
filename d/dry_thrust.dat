25|$|Two powerplants were {{initially}} selected for trials, the General Electric J79 turbojet and the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan. In the end, the J79 was selected, {{not least because}} it was the same engine used on the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which the Israelis began to acquire from the United States in 1969, along with a license to produce the J79 themselves. The J79 was clearly superior to the original French Atar 09, providing a <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> of 49kN (11,000lbf) and an afterburning thrust of 83.4kN (18,750lbf).|$|E

25|$|The Eurofighter Typhoon is {{fitted with}} two Eurojet EJ200 engines, each capable of {{providing}} up to 60kN (13,500lbf) of <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> and >90kN (20,230lbf) with afterburners. The EJ200 engine combines the leading technologies {{from each of the}} four European companies, using advanced digital control and health monitoring; wide chord aerofoils and single crystal turbine blades; and a convergent / divergent exhaust nozzle to give excellent thrust-to-weight ratio, multimission capability, supercruise performance, low fuel consumption, low cost of ownership, modular construction and significant growth potential.|$|E
25|$|Pre-{{production}} T-50 {{and initial}} production batches of the Su-57 will use interim engines, {{a pair of}} NPO Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1. Closely related to the Saturn 117S engine used by the Su-35S, the 117 engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL-31 that powers the Su-27 family of aircraft. The 117 engine produces 93.1kN (21,000lbf) of <b>dry</b> <b>thrust,</b> 147.1kN (33,067lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and has a thrust to weight ratio of 10.5:1. The engines have full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling.|$|E
25|$|Production {{fighters from}} 2020 onward will be {{equipped}} with a more powerful engine known as the izdeliye 30, a clean sheet design engine that will supersede the 117. NPO Saturn and MMPP Salyut are competing to supply this definitive second stage engine. Compared to the 117, the new powerplant will have increased thrust and fuel efficiency, greater reliability, and lower costs. The izdeliye 30 {{is designed to be}} 30% lower specific weight than its 117 predecessor. The new engine is designed to produce approximately 108kN (24,086lbf) of <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> and 178kN (39,680lbf) in afterburner. Full scale development began in 2011 and the engine's compressor began bench testing in December 2014. The first test engines are planned to be completed in 2016, and flight testing is projected to begin in 2017. According to Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Yuriy Borisov flight testing with new Izdeliye-30 engines will begin at Q4-2017. The new powerplant is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the 117 with minimal changes to the airframe.|$|E

50|$|A low (<b>dry)</b> {{specific}} <b>thrust</b> engine {{has a low}} tailpipe temperature, {{which means}} that the temperature rise across the afterburner can be high, giving a good thrust boost in afterburning. Nevertheless, the afterburning specific thrust is still relatively low. The total fuel flow (main combustor plus afterburner) is fixed by the temperature rise from air intake to nozzle and, for a given airflow, changes little with <b>dry</b> specific <b>thrust.</b> Consequently, the low afterburning thrust implies a high afterburning SFC. However, the dry SFC is low.|$|R

50|$|Most {{military}} aircraft use afterburners (or reheat) to occasionally travel at supersonic speeds and cannot reach supersonic speeds using the <b>dry</b> engine <b>thrust.</b> In these cases afterburners are highly inefficient compared to conventional jet engine operation {{due to the}} low pressures typically found in the exhaust section, but their engines are more efficient when the afterburners are not operational, although also less powerful.|$|R
2500|$|The aircraft's State {{acceptance}} trials were delayed {{until the first}} quarter of 1956 for lack of a flight-ready AM-11 engine, but this did not help and it had to be adapted to use a less powerful Mikulin AM-9D engine with only [...] of <b>dry</b> <b>thrust.</b> The gun armament was reduced to only two [...] Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 guns with 75 rounds per gun in compensation, but the estimated speed dropped by about [...] regardless. This was deemed to be acceptable as it sufficed to begin flight testing.|$|E
2500|$|The SNECMA M53 {{afterburning}} turbofan {{was developed}} for the ACF, and was available for the Mirage 2000 project. It is a single-shaft engine of modular construction that is relatively light and simple compared {{to those of the}} British or American designs. The M53 consists of three low-pressure turbine stages, five high-pressure stages and two turbine stages. With the development programme consisting of 20 engines, the M53 sans suffix was first bench tested in February 1970 and became airborne on a Caravelle testbed in July 1973. Dassault conducted flight tests of the M53-2 version using its Mirage F1E testbeds starting in December 1974; this version produced [...] in afterburner. The Mirage 2000 itself was powered by two versions of the M53 – the M53-5, which equipped initial operational aircraft, was rated at [...] of thrust with afterburner. The definitive version of the engine, the M53-P2, which equipped the majority of the type, is rated at [...] in <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> and [...] in afterburner.|$|E
2500|$|The F-94C Starfire was {{extensively}} modified {{from the}} early F-94 variants. In fact, it was initially designated F-97, but it was ultimately decided to treat it as {{a new version of}} the F-94. USAF interest was lukewarm, so Lockheed funded development themselves, converting two F-94B airframes to YF-94C prototypes for evaluation. To improve performance, a completely new, much thinner wing was designed, along with a swept tail surface. [...] The J33 engine was replaced with a more powerful Pratt & Whitney J48, a license-built version of the afterburning Rolls-Royce Tay, which dramatically increased power, producing a <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> of [...] and approximately [...] with afterburning. The fire control system was upgraded to the new Hughes E-5 with an AN/APG-40 radar in a much larger nose. The guns were removed and replaced with all-rocket armament consisting of four groups of six rockets in a ring around the nose. The rockets were carried in four panels that could be hinged upwards and outwards for ground reloading. In flight these rockets were normally hidden aft of [...] doors that folded inwards for combat.|$|E

2500|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} various {{models of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating [...] of <b>dry</b> <b>thrust,</b> but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of [...] Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600°C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} program {{sponsored by}} the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory is currently in progress to determine the internal and installed performance characteristics of five different thrust vectoring/reversing non-axisymmetric nozzle concepts for tactical fighter aircraft applications. Internal performance characteristics for the five non-axisymmetric nozzles and an advanced technology axisymmetric baseline nozzle were determined in static tests conducted in January 1977 at the NASA-Langley Research Center. The non-axisymmetric nozzle models were tested at thrust deflection angles of up to 30 degrees from horizontal at throat areas associated with both dry and afterburning power. In addition, <b>dry</b> power reverse <b>thrust</b> geometries were tested for three of the concepts. The best designs demonstrated internal performance levels essentially equivalent to the baseline axisymmetric nozzle at unvectored conditions. The best designs also gave minimum performance losses due to vectoring, and reverse thrust levels up to 50 % of maximum <b>dry</b> power forward <b>thrust.</b> The installed performance characteristics will be established based on wind tunnel testing to be conducted at Arnold Engineering Development Center {{in the fall of}} 1977...|$|R

50|$|USAF {{procurement}} of the Boeing 707 {{was very}} limited, amounting to three Model 707-153s designated VC-137A. When delivered in 1959 these had four 13,500 lb (6123 kg) <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> Pratt & Whitney J57 (JT3C6) turbojets; when subsequently re-engined with 18,000 lbf (80.1 kN) <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> TF33-P-5 (JT3D) turbofans they were redesignated VC-137B. Only one other variant {{served with the}} USAF: this was the VC-137C Air Force One presidential transport, the two examples of which were Model 707-320B Intercontinentals with specialized interior furnishings and advanced communications equipment. Two further non-presidential C-137C aircraft were later added.|$|E
5000|$|On some {{engines that}} are {{equipped}} with an afterburner the nozzle area is also varied during non-afterburning or <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> conditions. Typically the nozzle is fully open for starting and at idle. It may then close down as the thrust lever is advanced reaching its minimum area before or at the Military or max <b>dry</b> <b>thrust</b> setting. Two examples of this control are the General Electric J-79 and the Tumansky RD-33 in the MIG-29. Reasons for varying the nozzle area are explained in section [...] "Nozzle area control during dry operation".|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} that {{could benefit from}} the VCE approach is combat aircraft. Designers normally {{have to make a}} compromise on specific thrust of the engine. If they choose a high specific thrust, the reheat specific fuel consumption (SFC) will be very good, but the dry SFC poor. A high specific thrust implies a high fan pressure ratio, which indicates a high nozzle temperature in dry power. Consequently, the thrust boost in reheat is relatively low. By definition, both the <b>dry</b> and reheat <b>thrust</b> levels are good.|$|R
