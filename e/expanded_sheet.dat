40|$|Abstract: With {{the aims}} at {{determining}} the mechanical properties of <b>Expanded</b> Metal <b>Sheet</b> under seismic excitations, {{the research on}} <b>Expanded</b> Metal <b>Sheet</b> has been implementing at University of Liege. Firstly, the square and rectangular sheets worked in monotonic shear loading was thoroughly studied by E. Pecquet[1]. In his study, there are three approaches {{used to determine the}} mechanic behavior of <b>expanded</b> metal <b>sheets</b> monotonically loaded in shear, that is, analytical models, numerical simulations and experimental investigations were performed and compared simultaneously. Secondly, the same dimensions of the sheets will be studied under cyclic shear loading. In this research, non-linear numerical stimulations and experimental investigation will be used to determine the properties of <b>expanded</b> metal <b>sheets</b> under cyclic shear loads. The analytical models will be proposed with the aims at modeling the sheets in Reinforced Concrete Frames, the next step of this study. Numerical stimulations are implemented with FINELG, a non linear finite element code. <b>Expanded</b> Metal <b>Sheet</b> Experiments under reverse loading are to be carried out at Laboratory of University of Liege. Experimental Investigations will be compared with numerical stimulations to propose an analytical model, hysteric loop for this type of material under cyclic loading. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Collective cell {{migration}} is {{a hallmark of}} developmental and patho-physiological states, including wound healing and invasive cancer growth. The integrity of the <b>expanding</b> epithelial <b>sheets</b> can be influenced by extracellular cues, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We show the nano-scale topography of the extracellular matrix underlying epithelial cell layers can have a strong effect on the speed and morphology of the fronts of the <b>expanding</b> <b>sheet</b> triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We further demonstrate that this behavior depends on the mechano-sensitivity of the transcription regulator YAP and two new feedback cross-regulation mechanisms: through Wilms Tumor- 1 and E-cadherin, loosening cell-cell contacts, and through Rho GTPase family proteins, enhancing {{cell migration}}. These YAP-dependent regulatory feedback loops result in a switch-like change in the signaling and expression of EMT-related markers, leading to a robust enhancement in invasive epithelial sheet expansion, which {{might lead to a}} poorer clinical outcome in renal and other cancers...|$|R

These <b>sheets</b> are usually made of carbon steel, but due to their corrosion susceptible, studies have been developed with the aim to evaluate the viability of replacing these common steels by stainless steels. This study proposed an experimental method to characterize structural and mechanically samples of stainless steel extended sheets (410 D, 444 A, 439 and 304 A) and a 1010 carbon steel sheet thicker than the others. This study has a practical importance because nowadays there are not standardized procedures {{to do this kind}} of evaluation. The obtained results showed that the methodology was effective for the proposed objective and that the <b>expanded</b> <b>sheets</b> made of stainless steels have a better performance in terms of mechanical strength compared to the 1010 steel sheet...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a fire suppression spray is governed by injector discharge characteristics. An atomization model based on the theoretical evolution of a radially <b>expanding</b> <b>sheet</b> generated by an impinging jet {{has been established in}} this study. The atomization model predicts characteristic initial drop location, size, and velocity based on injector operating conditions and geometry. These model predictions have been compared with measured discharge characteristics from three nozzle configurations of increasing geometrical complexity over a range of operating conditions. Differences between the predicted and measured initial spray are critically evaluated based on the experimentally observed atomization behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of water-based {{fire suppression systems}} is governed largely by the spray discharge characteristics associated with the nozzle geometry and injection conditions. In many nozzle configurations such as sprinklers, this initial spray is produced by injecting a water jet onto an orthogonal deflector, resulting in thin, unstable, radially expanding streams. These streams ultimately disintegrate into a complex population of drops forming the spray. The initial spray is generated in distinct stages, which include sheet formation, sheet breakup, and ligament breakup. A Sprinkler Atomization Model (SAM) has been developed based on these physics to predict the initial drop velocity, location, and size based on the nozzle geometry and injection conditions. The initial spray from a simplified yet realistic sprinkler geometry has been quantified through detailed measurements to provide insight into these atomization processes and to evaluate SAM performance. Flow visualization revealed that the deflector produces a continuous radially expanding stream resulting from the flow directed over the tines and a connected underlying orthogonal stream resulting from the flow through the spaces. The measured and predicted breakup locations and drop sizes follow We- 1 / 3 scaling laws, previously established by other researchers in similar canonical configurations. However, SAM over predicts the volume median drop diameter {{by as much as}} 40 %, probably due to the absence of models to characterize the orthogonal stream underlying the radially <b>expanding</b> <b>sheet.</b> This orthogonal stream generated by the spaces was measured to consist of nearly 50 % of the flow and produces smaller drops than the radially <b>expanding</b> <b>sheet.</b> The detailed breakup mechanisms for this stream are currently being characterized to improve fidelity of the atomization model...|$|R

The EVA powder was found to be composed by two phases: a crosslinked phase (75 wt%) and a soluble one (25 wt%). The VAc content in EVA residues was found to be around 20 wt% and it is believed that the EVA had originally ca. 28 wt% of VAc before the crosslinking process, according to the TG analysis. Besides, it was found that the crosslinked structure of EVA residues make them stiffer than virgin EVA used for comparison, according to mechanical tests.

40|$|The {{problem of}} non {{isothermal}} absorption of vapour into freely <b>expanding</b> liquid <b>sheets</b> is {{addressed in this}} study. This {{is done in the}} context of four models that characterise the coupled heat and mass transfer in the liquid phase: a nonlinear model retaining the effect of sheet growth, an approximate model for slowly increasing mass flow rate in the sheet, a large Lewis number model and finally, a boundary layer model. These models have been numerically or analytically solved and applied to the comparative analysis of two different working pairs, LiBr H₂O and LiNO₃NH₃, under conditions representative of adiabatic absorption in refrigeration systems. The limits of applicability of each model have been assessed and the sensitivity of the results to the sheet aperture angle, heat of absorption and initial subcooling has also been tested. For equal initial mass fraction and subcooling, the models indicate that Sherwood number and the rate of absorption in laminar <b>expanding</b> <b>sheets</b> for the LiNO₃NH₃solution are always superior to those for the LiBr H₂O solutionThe authors wish to express their gratitude to Dr. M.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} {{sequence}} of events accompanying the transition from an initially compact volume of liquid a drop into dispersed fragments when it impacts a solid surface. We describe the change of topology of the drop to a radially <b>expanding</b> <b>sheet</b> and discuss the reasons of its rim destabilization, responsible for the emergence of radial ligaments which ultimately fragment into smaller drops. The dynamics ruling the radius of the sheet, its stability and the resulting fragment drop size distribution are documented experimentally. The radius dynamics results from a simple balance between inertia of the initial drop and capillary restoring forces at the rim, with damping due to the continuous transfer of momentum from the sheet to the rim. The ligaments expelled from the rim originate from a Rayleigh Taylor mechanism localized at the rim. The final drop size distribution in the spray is shown to be a linear superposition of gamma distributions characteristic of ligament breakup, leading generically to Bessel functions...|$|R

Later, the effect of SBR-r on the cure behavior, mechanical performance, swelling, and crosslink density of reused rubber was investigated, with more emphasis placed on the effect of both particle size and loading of waste filler. Cure characteristics such as optimum cure time and scorch time were then reduced by the increasing amount of SBR-r filler. Owing to the reinforced nature of the largest particle size SBR-r, the best results for the mechanical properties of NBR were those in which SBR-r was added {{at the end of the}} cure process.

To assess the validity of these assumptions and to quantify associated errors, here we report new analytical, numerical, and experimental investigations. For several commonly used experimental monolayer systems, the simplifying assumptions used previously lead to errors that are shown to be quite small. Out-of-plane components of displacement and traction fields can be safely neglected, and characteristic features of intercellular stresses that underlie plithotaxis remain largely unaffected. Taken together, these findings validate Monolayer Stress Microscopy within broad but well-defined limits of applicabilit...|$|R

We show how the instability properties set both the radial extent of the liquid sheet and the drop formation process at its rim. The shear instability gives the liquid a flag-like motion, ultimately triggering a Rayleigh{Taylor instability at the rim of the sheet which disintegrates, at the radial location R, into disjointed droplets of size d such that R=D 0 − 2 = 3 We− 1 = 3 and d=D 0 − 2 = 3 We− 1 : The features of the sheet instability, its radius and the droplet sizes are determined experimentally for a broad range of control parameters, using dierent liquids and ambient-medium densities. 1...|$|R

Total production of sugar phosphates in the mineral interlayer is largely independent of the glycolaldehyde phosphate concentration in the external solution, but is determined by the total amount of GAP offered for sorption up to the capacity of the mineral.

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that plasmin participates in pericellular {{proteolysis}} in the epidermis. Plasmin is generated by keratinocyte-associated plasminogen activators from the proenzyme plasminogen; plasminogen activation can proceed at the keratinocyte surface. The resultant plasmin interferes with cell to matrix adhesion and does possibly contribute to keratinocyte migration during reepithelialization. Here we describe the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA-R) in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, which serves to direct plasminogen activation to the cell surface; we relate the receptor to the uPA-R previously described in human myclo-/monocytes. Binding of uPA to the receptor accelerated plasminogen activation {{by a factor of}} [approximate] 10, compared to uPA in solution. Receptor-bound uPA was susceptible to inhibition by the plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2. uPA and uPA-R antigen, as well as uPA activity, were localized to the leading front of <b>expanding</b> <b>sheets</b> of HaCaT cells. Exposure of HaCaT cells to plasminogen was followed by detachment of the cells. Detachment was prevented by an anti-catalytic anti-uPA antibody, by the plasmin-specific inhibitor aprotinin, and by the lysine analogue tranexamic acid, the latter of which prevents plasmin(ogen) binding to the cell surface. Our findings support the hypothesis that uPA-mediated plasminogen activation is characteristic of mobile rather than sessile keratinocytes. Moreover, the uPA-R seems to focalize plasminogen activation to the surface of cells at the site of keratinocyte migration...|$|R
