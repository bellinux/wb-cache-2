5|$|Foster's <b>flair</b> <b>for</b> musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what {{is easily}} her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
