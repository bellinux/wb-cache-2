[...] In {{following}} interviews, Timberlake confirmed working with producers Timbaland, Pharrell Williams, Max Martin and Shellback, while stating, [...] "It sounds more like where I've come from than any other music I've ever made...

2500|$|Cougar Town {{was created}} by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. Following the {{cancellation}} of Dirt, Courteney Cox wanted to return to television and do another comedy. Lawrence, who {{is best known as}} the creator of Scrubs and Spin City, was approached by Cox about [...] "wanting to do something". While developing the concept of the show, Lawrence thought he would do a tryout with Cox on Scrubs, by guest starring in the first three episodes of the eighth season. Lawrence and Biegel, who worked together writing episodes on Scrubs, came up with the concept of the show with Cox as a 40-year-old newly single woman because he thought that it was a real [...] "zeitgeist-y topic". He drew inspiration from his real-life wife, actress Christa Miller who also stars in the show as Ellie; Miller had previously worked with Cox as part of the story-arc of the three part Scrubs tryout. Lawrence told Cox that the show could be [...] "high risk, high reward", although Cox decided to go for it. He added, [...] "I rarely have this much trepidation because usually the only person I could let down is myself. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work for her." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Haus of Gaga {{is modeled}} after Andy Warhol's Factory and emulates the {{creative}} atmosphere {{it is known}} for. Inspired by Warhol's concepts, his ideas are often referenced in Gaga's work and the innovative technologies conceived by the Haus.

[...] "He was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> commercial art that was taken seriously as fine art ... that's what I'm doing too." [...] The team is composed of {{people from around the}} world.

Or that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my cane light up. Or that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pair of dope sunglasses. Or that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> video glasses, or whatever it was that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It's a whole amazing creative process that’s completely separate from the label.By integrating the themes explored in Gaga's music into her appearance, the Haus idealizes a lifestyle hybrid of pop culture, art, and technology.|$|R
