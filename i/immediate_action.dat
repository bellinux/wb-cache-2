5|$|Manchester United and Arsenal took <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> by fining {{a number}} of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for {{bringing}} the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as {{they were involved in}} a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.|$|E

Although Somerset was interviewed by police, no <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> was taken against him, and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset's involvement. A watch was placed on the now-empty house and details of the case shuffled between government departments.|$|E

5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E
5|$|No <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> {{had been}} taken after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King Kalākaua was {{interested}} and government officials saw {{a way to get}} out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman Claus Spreckels was willing to make the arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E

5|$|Edward's initial {{reaction}} to the news of Gaveston's execution was rage; according to the Vita Edwardi he swore to avenge the act. Circumstances, however, prevented him from taking <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> against the executioners. During the previous raid on Newcastle, the King and Gaveston had to flee quickly, leaving behind horses and jewels worth {{a great amount of}} money. At the same time, the barons' extralegal action had alienated many of their former associates; the Earl of Pembroke in particular became strongly tied to the King's cause after the affront to his honour. Through the arbitration of the Earl of Gloucester and others, a settlement was finally reached on 14 October 1313, whereby the barons were given a pardon and the horses and jewels were returned to the King. The following years were marked by a constant power struggle between Edward and Lancaster, centred on the maintenance of the Ordinances. The matter was not finally settled until 1322, when Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and executed.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2008, {{the state}} government, which {{was accused of}} {{reluctance}} to take <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> ultimately arrested Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi (a local SP leader) on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance. Although released that same day, a gag order was imposed on both leaders {{to prevent them from}} making further inflammatory remarks. Meanwhile, tensions in Maharashtra rose as the news of Raj's possible arrest, and his subsequent actual arrest, angered his supporters. Incidences of violence against North Indians and their property by MNS workers were reported in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Beed, Nashik, Amravati, Jalna, and Latur. Nearly 25,000 North Indian workers fled Pune, and another 15,000 fled Nashik {{in the wake of the}} attacks. The exodus of workers caused an acute labour shortage, affecting local industries. Analysts estimated financial losses of –. Although the violence receded after the arrests of the two leaders, sporadic attacks were reported until May 2008. After months of lull, on 19 October 2008, MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam in Mumbai. The incident led to Raj's arrest and fresh violence. Later on 28 October 2008 a labourer from Uttar Pradesh was lynched in a Mumbai commuter train.|$|E

40|$|Markovian process calculi {{constitute}} a useful framework for reasoning about the functional and performance aspects of concurrent systems. This {{is achieved by}} means of behavioral equivalences that take into account both the action names and their exponentially distributed durations. A notable extension to the ex-pressiveness of Markovian process calculi derives from the adoption of GSPN-like <b>immediate</b> <b>actions,</b> i. e. actions with a zero duration and equipped with a priority level and a weight. Since internal <b>immediate</b> <b>actions</b> are unobservable both from the functional viewpoint and from the performance viewpoint, {{in this paper we}} tackle the problem of defining a weak variant of Markovian bisimilar-ity that abstracts from such actions. We show that the proposed equivalence is a congruence and admits a sound and complete axiomatization for the class of well-prioritized process terms. 1...|$|R
