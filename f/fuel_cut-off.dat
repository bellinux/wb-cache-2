40|$|The flame quality {{indicator}} concept was developed at BNL specifically {{to monitor the}} brightness of the flame in a small oil burner and to provide a ''call for service'' notification when the brightness has changed from its setpoint, either high or low. In prior development work BNL has explored the response of this system to operational upsets such as excess air changes, fouled atomizer nozzles, poor fuel quality, etc. Insight Technologies, Inc. and Honeywell, Inc. have licensed this technology from the U. S. Department of Energy and have been cooperating to develop product offerings which meet industry needs with an optimal combination of function and price. Honeywell has recently completed the development of the Flame Quality Monitor (FQM or Honeywell QS 7100 F). This is a small module which connects via a serial cable to the burners primary operating control. Primary advantages of this approach are simplicity, cost, and ease of installation. Call-for-service conditions are output in the form of front panel indicator lights and contact closure which can trigger a range of external communication options. Under this project a field test was conducted of the FQM in cooperation with service organizations in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. At total of 83 field sites were included. At each site the FQM was installed in parallel with another embodiment of this concept [...] the Insight AFQI. The AFQI incorporates a modem and provides the ability to provide detailed information on the trends in the flame quality {{over the course of the}} two year test period. The test site population was comprised of 79. 5 % boilers, 13. 7 % warm air furnaces, and 6. 8 % water heaters. Nearly all were of residential size [...] with firing rates ranging from 0. 6 gallons of oil per hour to 1. 25. During the course of the test program the monitoring equipment successfully identified problems including: plugged fuel lines, fouled nozzles, collapsed combustion chambers, and poor <b>fuel</b> pump <b>cut-off.</b> Service organizations can use these early indications to reduce problems and service costs. There were also some ''call-for-service'' indications for which problems were not identified. The test program also showed that monitoring of the flame can provide information on burner run times and this can be used to estimate current oversize factors and to determine actual fuel usage, enabling more efficient fuel delivery procedures...|$|R

50|$|A major {{mid-cycle}} refresh débuted at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show. Changes {{were made}} to the exterior and interior of the car. Outside there were more modern, enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights; the redesigned grille and bonnet bore a family resemblance to the flagship Thema. Also new were the ventilation grille on the C-pillar and full-wheel hubcaps. Inside new seats, new instrumentation and air conditioning system.The 1986 range included seven models, two of them all-new: 1.3, 1.5, 1.5 Automatica, 1.6, 1.6 i.e., 4WD, diesel and turbo ds. 1.3 and 1.5 models had revised intake and exhaust system, <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off,</b> a new carburettor and breakerless ignition. The diesel versions had also received some minor engine updates, and the turbo diesel had been renamed turbo ds.The new Prisma 1.6 i.e. used a version of the 1585 cc twin-cam engine equipped with Weber-Marelli IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system, developing 108 PS. In comparison to the carburetted Prisma 1600—which remained on sale as Prisma 1.6—further changes had been made: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity.|$|E

The roof spoiler introduced in 1982 was removed.Seven models composed the 1986 range: 1.3, LX 1.3, 1.5 Automatica, GT i.e., HF turbo, HF 4WD and turbo ds.Entry-level model was the 1.3; the 1,301 cc engine had revised intake and exhaust system, <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off,</b> a new carburettor and breakerless ignition. It was also available on the more upscale LX 1.3. Similar changes were made to the powertrain of the Delta 1.5 Automatica.The Delta GT and HF turbo were given Weber IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system to become the Delta GT i.e. and the Delta HF turbo i.e., with 108 PS and 140 PS respectively. Deeper changes had been made to the GT i.e. engine: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity. Delta HF turbo was updated to HF 4WD looks and interior, from which it differed mainly for the square headlights and single exhaust.Delta turbo ds marked the introduction of the first diesel engine on the Delta. This was a 1,929 cc 8-valve four-cylinder from the Prisma, with an output of 80 PS; it used a KKK turbocharger with wastegate valve, an intercooler and an oil cooler. The turbo ds was positioned on the market like the GT i.e., and given similarly complete standard equipment comprising such features as an oil pressure gauge, boost pressure gauge and power steering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Errors in the {{estimation}} of friction torque in modern spark ignition automotive engines necessitate the development of real-time algorithms for adaptation of the friction torque. Friction torque in the engine control unit {{is presented as a}} look-up table with two input variables (the engine speed and indicated engine torque). The algorithms proposed in this paper estimate the engine friction torque via the crankshaft speed fluctuations at the <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> state and at idle. A computationally efficient filtering algorithm for reconstruction of the first harmonic of a periodic signal is used to recover an amplitude which corresponds to engine events from the noise-contaminated engine speed measurements at the <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> state. The values of the friction torque at the nodes of the look-up table are updated, when new measured data of the friction torque are available. New data-driven algorithms which are based on a stepwise regression method are developed for adaptation of look-up tables. The algorithms are verified by using a spark ignition six-cylinder prototype engine...|$|E

Approximately of 10 % fatalities is caused by tank truck accident, it recorded by PT. Pertamina Persero, Indonesia in 2015 that 17 % and 20 % tank truck accident is caused by over speed and fatigue, respectively. Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of tank truck accident. Main objective of this research is to install speed limiter on the tank truck in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route travel. Speed limiter is installed to the tank truck engine which completed by <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined. From the result shows that top speed which performed by driver up to 133 km/h when tank truck uninstalled by speed limiter.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a decoupler and a controlled-feathering device incorporated with the YT- 56 A turboprop engine {{has been made to}} determine the effectiveness of these devices in reducing the high negative thrust (drag) which accompanies power failure of this type of engine. Power failures were simulated by <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off,</b> both without either device free to operate, and with each device free to operate singly. The investigation was made through an airspeed range from 50 to 230 mph. It was found that with neither device free to operate, the drag levels realized after power failures at airspeeds above 170 mph would impose vertical tail loads higher than those allowable for the YC- 130, the airplane for which the test power package was designed. These levels were reached in approximately one second. The maximum drag realized after power failure was not appreciably altered by the use of the decoupler although the decoupler did put a limit on the duration of the peak drag. The controlled-feathering device maintained a level of essentially zero drag after power failure. The use of the decoupler in the YT- 56 A engine complicates windmilling air-starting procedures and makes it necessary to place operating restrictions on the engine to assure safe flight at low-power conditions,...|$|E
40|$|Stopping and {{accelerating}} at {{traffic lights}} {{is one of}} the main contributing factors to vehicular emissions in urban environments. The work in this paper demonstrates a generic guideline for minimizing CO 2 emissions at traffic lights. This was done using an adaptive control, which uses a cost function for optimization, rather than network-specific control parameters. A new version of the emission model PHEMlight was used, which added of a <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> mode during coasting and other improvements compared to the previous version. Using this model, it could be determined that the emission optimal ratio between delay time and stops for the cost function of an adaptive control should be 1 : 165 at 50 km/h. When the speed limit increases the ratio also increases with 1 : 296 for 70 km/h. However, it was also found that the optimal free flow travel speed was around 70 km/h. Therefore with long distances between intersections and a low amount of average stops, the maximum speed should be higher than 50 km/h for emission optimality. Application of the ratio for 50 km/h to the adaptive control algorithm ImFlow resulted in a CO 2 emission reduction of 6. 3 % compared to a vehicle actuated control...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{previous}} studies have proven that pneumatic hybridization of an internal combustion engine is a technically viable and cost-efficient alternative to electric hybridization. Because the heat transfer process remains a first order factor while the engine operates in a motored or pneumatic mode without combustion, an accurate instantaneous heat transfer model is {{required in order to}} predict the in-cylinder pressure. This study shows that the original Woschni model is not suitable for describing the shape of the measured instantaneous heat flux versus crank angle while the engine operates in a motored pneumatic mode, because of the extinction of tumble motion near Top Dead Center (TDC). A modified form of the Woschni model is therefore proposed here that better describes the instantaneous heat flux during compression and expansion strokes, applicable to pneumatic and motored with <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> modes. First, the new constant parameter model is identified from experimental measurements performed in various motored mode conditions. Next, the pneumatic supercharged mode without combustion (ignition not performed) is investigated with the new model using the same identification values as for the motored mode. This study shows that the modified model remains fully applicable to the supercharged mode, despite of a certainly modified in-cylinder aerodynamic structure created by the opening of the charging valve under a high pressure ratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Finding {{the correct}} Top Dead Center (TDC) offset for an {{internal}} combustion engine is harder than it seems. This study introduces a novel method to find the TDC offset based on the simple assumption that the heat loss power through the combustion chamber walls is constant for motored cycles in a narrow Crank Angle interval around TDC. The proposed method uses nonlinear least squares optimization to find the combination of specific heat ratio and TDC offset that makes the heat loss power as constant as possible. An important subproblem {{is to determine the}} peak pressure location with high accuracy. Fitting a third order Fourier series to the motored cylinder pressure allows the pressure maximum to be estimated {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 005 ° Crank Angle (CA) and it can also be used instead of the measured pressure to reduce the uncertainty of the TDC estimate by approximately 50 %. The standard deviation of a single-cycle TDC estimate is approximately 0. 025 ° CA when using a crank resolution of 0. 2 ° CA for the measurements. The bias of the TDC estimate is in the 0 - 0. 02 ° CA range both when comparing to measurements with a TDC sensor and with simulated motored cycles. The method can be used both for calibration and on-board diagnostics purposes e. g. during cranking, <b>fuel</b> <b>cut-off</b> or engine switch-off. The third order Fourier series fit comes with a significant computational penalty but since it is only applied very intermittently this does not have to be a serious issue...|$|E
