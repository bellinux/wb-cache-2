As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire <b>dairy</b> <b>herd</b> at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases them back to the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E

Among the Gernatts' harness racing horses were those that were bred on their farm, identified by the presence of the last name 'Collins', the town's name.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} {{insemination}} quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous {{to keep on}} the average dairy facility. AI also {{makes it possible to}} speed the genetic improvement of the <b>dairy</b> <b>herd</b> because every dairy farmer has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI does require more intensive reproductive management of the herd as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly inseminate a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.|$|E

During this time the castle was renovated and served as host to famous visitors such as Guglielmo Marconi. Robert Baden-Powell, {{a close friend of}} the van Raaltes, hosted an experimental camp for boys on the island in the summer of 1907. Brownsea was largely self-supporting, with a kitchen garden and a <b>dairy</b> <b>herd.</b> Many of the pottery factory workers had stayed on after it closed, farming and working for the owners. Charles van Raalte died in Calcutta in 1907 and his wife eventually sold the island in 1925. In 1927 the island was purchased at auction by Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000. A recluse by nature, she ordered a mass eviction of the island's residents to the mainland. Most of the island was abandoned and gradually reverted to natural heath and woodland. In 1934, a wild fire caused devastation after burning for a week. Much of the island was reduced to ashes, and the buildings to the east were only saved by a change of wind direction. Traumatised by the event, Bonham-Christie banned all public access to the island {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{continued}} with her studies at Harper Adams {{and she and}} David eventually established [...] "a good working relationship". Ruth was given the responsibility of looking after the <b>dairy</b> <b>herd,</b> before becoming {{a partner in the}} farm. Ruth and David's first child, Philippa Rose, or Pip (Helen Monks), was born in February 1993. Joanna Toye and Adrian Flynn, authors of The Archers Encyclopaedia, said Ruth took to motherhood well and did not let it stop her from playing an active part in Brookfield. The couple's second child, Joshua, was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some Hereford cattle and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm. Ruth told David that [...] "time was too precious to spend in argument" [...] and suggested they moved away. However, David's father, Phil, decided that the farm should go to the couple.|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} the <b>dairy</b> <b>herd</b> in May 2004, David and Ruth hired specialist herdsman Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs). Ruth frequently {{came into contact}} with Sam around the farm and he confided in Ruth about his relationship with Kirsty Miller (Annabelle Dowler). Ruth found herself becoming jealous when Sam went on holiday with Kirsty. In their book, The Archers Archives, Simon Frith and Chris Arnot commented that the [...] "simmering mix of sexual chemistry" [...] between Ruth and Sam reached boiling point when David's ex-girlfriend, Sophie Barlow, returned to Ambridge and asked David to help organise a charity fashion show. Ruth became stressed and insecure about David spending time with his ex-girlfriend and she turned to Sam. The main reason for Ruth's insecurity was her image, as she had recently undergone a mastectomy and felt [...] "dowdy" [...] next to Sophie. Ruth became emotionally confused when Sam informed her that he had broken up with Kirsty. She then caught David lying about meeting up with Sophie and believed he was having an affair. Unbeknownst to Ruth, Sophie had tried to entice David into an affair, but he resisted her advances.|$|E
40|$|Extended-spectrum β-lactamase and AmpC-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL/AmpC) are an {{emerging}} problem and are hypothesized {{to be associated}} with antimicrobial use (AMU), and more specifically with the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Whether ESBL/AmpC also occur in organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds,</b> which have restricted AMU, is not known. Additionally, it is unknown whether, in addition to restricted AMU, other factors in organic herd management are associated with ESBL/AmpC herd status. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> in the Netherlands. Subsequently, the relationships between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and AMU and between ESBL/AmpC herd status and farmers' management were assessed in organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds.</b> For this study, 90 randomly selected, officially registered organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> were included. The ESBL/AmpC herd status was determined based on the bacteriological culture result of a slurry sample. The sensitivity of testing slurry samples for ESBL/AmpC herd status is less than 100 % for detecting herds with a low ESBL/AmpC prevalence. For that reason, herds that tested positive for ESBL/AmpC in slurry were defined as positive and herds with negative slurry samples were defined as unsuspected. A comprehensive questionnaire on management practices was conducted and records on specified antimicrobials that were provided to these herds by the veterinary service providers were obtained. From the data on antimicrobial supplies by the veterinarian, the animal daily defined dose of antimicrobials per farm per year (DDDAF) was calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the relation between the ESBL/AmpC herd status and DDDAF. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate management factors associated with the ESBL/AmpC herd status. We found ESBL/AmpC in 12 of the 90 (13 %; 95 % confidence interval = 7 - 22 %) slurry samples from organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds.</b> The median DDDAF in organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> was 0. 5, which was not significantly different between ESBL/AmpC-positive and -unsuspected <b>dairy</b> <b>herds.</b> No association could be found between the use of different types of antimicrobials, such as third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, and ESBL/AmpC herd status. Factors that were associated with higher odds of being ESBL/AmpC-positive were pig farms located within a 2 -km radius of the barn, applying parental treatment for clinical mastitis, and providing milk replacer to the female calves after colostrum intake. The prevalence of ESBL/AmpC in organic <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> appeared lower than the prevalence in previous studies conducted in conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>herds.</b> Apparently, ESBL/AmpC are also present in herds with low AMU; this indicates that other factors than AMU are also associated with ESBL/AmpC herd status...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a decision support system to optimise replacement and insemination decisions in Irish <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> under market conditions. The technique used was developed specifically for animal replacement problems, and is known as a ‘Hierarchic Markov Process’. The model optimises culling decisions on the basis of lactation, production level, calving date, fertility and calving interval. Production, involuntary culling rates, feed costs, carcass values and other economic factors are allowed to vary according to the traits of a particular animal. The output from the model is a series of retention payoffs (RPO) upon which culling decisions are based. RPO is the expected future return in keeping a cow for an additional stage rather than replacing her with a heifer. A study of culling rates in commercial <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> was also carried out and the effect of culling strategies on the genetic level of <b>dairy</b> <b>herds</b> was investigated using Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
