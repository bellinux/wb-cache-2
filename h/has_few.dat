5|$|Because of {{its small}} size, Hale Barns <b>has</b> <b>few</b> schools. Amongst them are St Ambrose College which {{provides}} education for 11- to 18-year-olds and Elmridge Primary.|$|E
5|$|Thailand's {{habitats}} are contiguous {{with those}} of neighbouring countries, so it <b>has</b> <b>few</b> endemic birds. The white-eyed river martin, known only from its single wintering site in Thailand, is probably extinct.|$|E
5|$|Although central Leeds <b>has</b> <b>few</b> {{buildings}} {{from the}} Middle Ages, there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries, including two at Wetherby. Wetherby Bridge {{dates from the}} Medieval period, but has been considerably altered, the pointed Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by semi-circular arches. It is said that the Bishop of York granted absolution of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge.|$|E

50|$|The QPCS sixth form (referred to as years 12 and 13) <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> tutor groups {{than the}} rest of the school, due to <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> students. Nevertheless, the same naming scheme is used.|$|R
5000|$|Longer lifetime: <b>Having</b> <b>fewer</b> {{moving parts}} also means <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> parts prone to failure. Failures in other systems are usually {{produced}} by {{aging of the}} component (such as a stretched belt), or stress.|$|R
5|$|Bismuth <b>has</b> <b>few</b> {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, theatre {{director}} Peter Sellars {{released his}} only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film {{loosely based on}} Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it <b>has</b> <b>few</b> similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released.|$|E
5|$|Oilseed– This type {{is grown}} for its seeds, which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking. It <b>has</b> <b>few</b> leaves, bolts quickly and {{produces}} seeds around 50 percent larger than {{other types of}} lettuce.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Frequency—How often {{a person}} has IIs ranging from rarely to quite frequently. For example, lonely people <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> IIs because they <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> {{interaction}} scenes to access compared to nonlonely people (Honeycutt, 2003).|$|R
50|$|Having more {{checkers}} {{is usually}} an advantage, {{because they can}} limit the opponent's options as they mass together.On the other hand, material considerations are not all-important, because <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> checkers also means <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> to unite.|$|R

5|$|Somerset <b>has</b> <b>few</b> {{industrial}} centres, but it {{does have}} a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Unemployment is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Texas has 3,700 named {{streams and}} 15 major rivers, with the Rio Grande as the largest. Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River. While Texas <b>has</b> <b>few</b> natural lakes, Texans have built over 100 {{artificial}} reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat <b>has</b> <b>few</b> predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The hexahydrate <b>has</b> <b>few</b> applications, but {{aluminium}} chlorohydrate {{is a common}} component in antiperspirants at low concentrations. Hyperhidrosis sufferers need a much higher concentration (12% or higher), sold under such brand names as Xeransis, Drysol, DryDerm, sunsola, Maxim, Odaban, CertainDri, B+Drier, Chlorhydrol, Anhydrol Forte and Driclor.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} <b>has</b> <b>few</b> natural predators; attacks on this species have been {{reported}} from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related nurse shark {{has been known to}} fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) <b>has</b> <b>few</b> derived characteristics. This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E
50|$|Injectable {{cladribine}} suppresses the body's {{ability to}} make new blood cells (called Myelosuppression); data from HCL studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> white blood cells and about 30% developed infections {{and some of those}} progressed to septic shock; about 40% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> red blood cells and became severely anemic; and about 10% of people <b>had</b> too <b>few</b> platelets.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis <b>has</b> <b>few</b> predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it <b>has</b> <b>few</b> commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that <b>has</b> <b>few</b> insect species.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, the park <b>has</b> <b>few</b> reptile and {{amphibian}} species {{with only one}} species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway <b>has</b> <b>few</b> signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
5|$|For cycling, {{although}} hilly, Sheffield is {{compact and}} <b>has</b> <b>few</b> major trunk roads. It {{is on the}} Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle Network route running from West to East from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North to South from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire. There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, though very few cycle lanes in the city itself.|$|E
