In these {{conditions}} {{the presence of}} a foot valve may slow down progress, since clay has to be pounded into suspension and stones have to be ground to small pieces in order to enter the drilling tool through the foot valve.|$|R
50|$|Ice cores are drilled by <b>hollow</b> <b>bits,</b> in {{much the}} same way that {{sediment}} cores are drilled. When all that is needed is the hole, hot water drill technology may be used to melt holes in ice or snow for both Arctic and Antarctic research purposes. Equipment for such a method is also lightweight when drilling deep holes, compared to traditional drilling equipment. Hot water drilling has been used successfully in the IceCube Neutrino Detector and Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array projects to drill as deep as 2,450 meters.|$|R
50|$|Action: The thick, hollow {{mouthpiece}} {{spreads out}} pressure, thought {{to make it}} less severe. However, this effect varies with the mouth structure of the individual horse. Some horses prefer a smaller diameter bit in their mouth because their mouths do not have room for the thick mouthpieces, and in such cases a <b>hollow</b> mouth <b>bit</b> may cause discomfort.|$|R
40|$|Precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS) are viable ex vivo explants {{of tissue}} with a reproducible, well defined thickness. They {{represent}} a mini-model of the organ under study and contain all {{cells of the}} tissue in their natural environment, leaving intercellular and cell-matrix interactions intact, and are therefore highly appropriate for studying multicellular processes. PCTS are mainly used to study the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics, but they are suitable for many other purposes. Here we describe the protocols to prepare and incubate rat and human liver and intestinal slices. Slices are prepared from fresh liver by making a cylindrical core using a drill with a <b>hollow</b> <b>bit,</b> from which slices are cut with a specially designed tissue slicer. Intestinal tissue is embedded in cylinders of agarose before slicing. Slices remain viable for 24 h (intestine) and up to 96 h (liver) when incubated in 6 - or 12 -well plates under 95 % O(2) / 5 % CO(2) atmosphere...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>hollow</b> {{cylindrical}} <b>bit</b> {{which will}} cut a hole with an annular cross-section {{and leave the}} inner cylinder of material (the [...] "core") intact, often removing it, is also called a core drill bit or annular cutter. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core drill bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{technique}} {{used to estimate}} the anisotropy parameter is directly measure them from the core which is extracted through a special <b>hollow</b> drill <b>bit</b> during drill process. Since coring a sample will generate large extra cost, only limited number of core samples can be obtained for each well. Thus the anisotropy parameter obtained through core measurement technique only represent the anisotropy property of rock near the borehole at just several specific depth, rending this technique often provides little help on the field seismic survey application. The measurements on each shale plug require at least one week.From {{the context of this}} article, wave propagation in a vertically transverse medium can be described with five elastic constants, and ratios among these parameters define the rock anisotropy [...] This anisotropy parameter can be obtained in the laboratory by measuring the velocity travel speed with transducer ultrasonic systems at variable saturation and pressure conditions. Usually, three directions of wave propagation on core samples are the minimum requirement to estimate the five elastic coefficients of the stiffness tensor. Each direction in core plug measurement yields three velocities (one P and two S).|$|R

[...] Brian James of PopMatters also criticized the video quality, and said the performance itself [...] "feels a <b>bit</b> <b>hollow,</b> too. The very feeling that drove the band’s music—some kind of loathing that was spread amorphously inwards and outwards—is absent, replaced instead by a lovefest between Iggy and the crowd." ...|$|R
50|$|Paper {{drilling}} is {{a method}} to drill round holes into paper and other materials. For this purpose <b>hollow</b> paper drill <b>bits</b> are clamped into a driven spindle which drills into the pile of paper. Paper drill bits are available for different hole sizes and in different coating qualities. Unlike hole punching, where only {{one or a few}} sheets may be processed, a large number of sheets can be processed with a paper drilling machine. Depending on the type of paper drill either the paper drill bits are lowered into the pile or the table is lifted. Paper drilling machines can be equipped with a different number of spindles which are each built into one paper drill head. The range starts with one- and two-spindle paper drills for small volumes and office purposes and reaches up to paper drilling platforms with more than 20 spindles / paper drill heads.|$|R

Spent nuclear fuel rods re stored underwater in large indoor swimming pool-like facilities where the water cover shields the workers from the radiation. This paper describes three specialized tooling systems that were designed and built by Sonsub for work at the Department of Energy`s Hanford site. The Door Seal Tool removed an existing seal system, cleaned a 20 ft. tall, carbon steel, underwater hatch and installed a new stainless steel gasket surface with underwater epoxy. The Concrete Sampling Tool was built to take core samples from the vertical, concrete walls of the basins. The tool has three hydraulic drills with proprietary <b>hollow</b> core drill <b>bits</b> to cut and retrieve the concrete samples. The Rack Saw remotely attached itself to a structure, cut a variety of steel shapes and pipes, and retained the cut pieces for retrieval. All of these systems are remotely operated with onboard video cameras and debris collection systems. The methods and equipment proven in this application are available to refurbish sealing surfaces and to drill or sample concrete in offshore oil field applications...|$|R
40|$|Overcoring is a {{measurement}} method used for estimating {{the state of}} stress in a rock mass. The method is based on measuring the strains that develop when a sample of rock, by drilling with a <b>hollow</b> core <b>bit,</b> is released from the surrounding rock and the stresses acting upon it. During the current work to find a site suitable for a future underground repository for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in Sweden, the overcoring stress measurement method {{was used in the}} site investigation programme. In some of these tests temperature effects have been noted, which affect the reliability of the results. The causes and consequences of these effects have not been investigated though. This thesis work was conducted to address part of the issue of temperature effects during overcoring. The main part of the thesis consisted of a study of which of the parameters (i) logger, (ii) glue, (iii) strain gauges and (iv) material type that were most sensitive to temperature effects during overcoring. The temperature sensitivity was determined by measuring the strains recorded by the logger when heating each object in different test cases. All of the factors logger, glue and material showed a response dependent on temperature. The response of the logger was so small in magnitude that it could be neglected on basis of the small magnitude of the absolute error it caused on calculated stresses. The glue showed a response of fairly great magnitude regarding temperature change when not fully cured. When subjected to temperature increase, the curing of the glue was reactivated, causing shrinkage of the material and affecting strain readings to seem smaller in magnitude than the true value. The rock cores tested showed a temperature response of great magnitude. The response was not that of an ideal material as the cores did not expand and contract as expected when subjected to temperature change. The response could thus not be quantified based on the tests performed It is not known if these factors are independent or dependent of each other and hence it is hard to tell which factor that is most sensitive to temperature increase during an actual overcoring. The temperature effects of the glue and rock were difficult to quantify and thus also difficult to compensate for. Therefore they should be avoided by minimizing the temperature increase caused by overcoring. This can be done by better flushing and temperature control, by a larger overcoring diameter or possibly by a different overcoring feed speed or different drill bit. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Very well. I squeeze among the crowd, and I look about me. When I see a great lady very suitable for my business, I say [...] "You'll do, my dear!" [...] and I take particular notice of her, and run home and cut her out and baste her. Then another day, I come scudding back again to try on, and then I take particular notice of her again. Sometimes she plainly seems to say, 'How that little creature is staring!' and sometimes likes it and sometimes don't, but much more often yes than no. All the time I am only saying to myself, [...] "I must <b>hollow</b> out a <b>bit</b> here; I must slope away there;" [...] and I am making a perfect slave of her, with making her try on my doll's dress. Evening parties are severer work for me, because there's only a doorway for a full view, and what with hobbling among {{the wheels of the}} carriages and the legs of the horses, I fully expect to be run over some night. However, there I have 'em, just the same. When they go bobbing into the hall from the carriage, and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy poked out from behind a policeman's cape in the rain, I dare say they think I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart, but they little think they're only working for my dolls! There was Lady Belinda Whitrose. I made her do double duty in one night. I said when she came out of the carriage, [...] "YOU'll do, my dear!" [...] and I ran straight home and cut her out and basted her. Back I came again, and waited behind the men that called the carriages. Very bad night too. At last, [...] "Lady Belinda Whitrose's carriage! Lady Belinda Whitrose coming down!" [...] And I made her try on--oh! and take pains about it too--before she got seated. That's Lady Belinda hanging up by the waist, much too near the gaslight for a wax one, with her toes turned in.' ...|$|R
40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a coring bit is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning coring <b>bit</b> (<b>hollow</b> interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a coring bit were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a coring bit without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density. A controlled acceleration or deceleration may be used to drop the least-frictional particles or to eventually shear the unconsolidated material near the bit center...|$|R
