5|$|Tini {{discovers that}} Tono has been having an affair, and is furious. She then goes to meet Yah. However, {{after a long}} talk she decides that Yah is better for Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him; Tini then moves back to Surabaya, leaving Tono in Batavia. However, Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono's {{respected}} status as a doctor because of her history. She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono {{as well as a}} record with a song recorded especially <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of saying goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar, giving a speech on the radio. Tono, now alone, dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{discovers that}} he is a {{descendant}} of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled. Deus, however, had become self-aware and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus' power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel's longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion. When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self-destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now-adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus. One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. Ramsus, revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of Emperor Cain created by Solaris scientists as a means of controlling Deus who was rejected in favor of Fei, hence his hatred of the latter, attacks one more time and is finally defeated. He is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid the group.|$|E

25|$|Praise <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trainer was {{slightly}} more muted, but, after the 1871 Grand National victory with The Lamb, a correspondent did comment {{on him in}} the following terms: 'Chris Green has not had charge of Lord Poulett's horses more than a twelvemonth, and it is something in the trainer's favour {{that he was able}} to win a Grand National on the first time of asking'.|$|E

25|$|A {{right arm}} bowler of slow to medium pace, Walter Mead always {{maintained}} an excellent length and could spin back to deadly effect whenever wickets {{were affected by}} rain. He could vary his stock off break with a ball that turned the other way, but he lacked the deceptive flight that enabled such bowlers as Blythe, Dennett or J.C. White to do well on firm pitches. He rarely did much as a batsman, but when sent in as night-watchman against Leicestershire in 1902 he surprised the crowd so much by making 119 {{that there was a}} special collection <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reward.|$|E

25|$|At first no {{suitable}} coffin for {{the body}} could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get {{in or out of}} the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the Maury River. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the General's body, though it was a bit short <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Lee was buried without shoes. He was buried underneath Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, where his body remains.|$|E
25|$|Goodall {{had always}} been passionate about animals and Africa, which {{brought her to the}} farm of a friend in the Kenya {{highlands}} in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals tied a {{franchise}} record, {{not seen since}} 1940, with 13 extra-base hits (6 Home Runs, 5 Doubles, 2 Triples) in an 11-6 win against the Seattle Mariners, at Safeco Field on June 26. The six home runs, second time in a game this season (April 15), boosted the team total to 101. They had 137 in all of 2015, and 105 in 2014. Matt Carpenter tripled, and hit two home runs in the barrage of 17 hits. Tommy Pham also hit two home runs. Jedd Gyorko hit one, as did Matt Holliday, the 150th <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Cardinals' player. All six home runs were solo blasts and all came in the sixth-ninth innings. The six home runs were one short of the seven for the franchise record, set in 1996, and 1913.|$|E

50|$|The series starred Robert Horton, who had costarred on Wagon Train from 1957 to 1962.

25|$|Truth had a life-changing {{religious}} experience during her {{stay with the}} Van Wagenens, and became a devout Christian. In 1829 she moved with her son Peter to New York City, where {{she worked as a}} housekeeper for Elijah Pierson, a Christian Evangelist. While in New York, she befriended Mary Simpson, a grocer on John Street who claimed she had once been enslaved by George Washington. They shared an interest in charity for the poor and became intimate friends. In 1832, she met Robert Matthews, also known as Prophet Matthias, and went to work <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> housekeeper at the Matthias Kingdom communal colony. Elijah Pierson died, and Robert Matthews and Truth were accused of stealing from and poisoning him. Both were acquitted of the murder, though Matthews was convicted of lesser crimes, served time, and moved west.|$|E
25|$|Closer {{as friends}} over summer 2006, sexual tension between Babe and Josh becomes evident. Even though still married to JR, Babe starts to have romantic {{feelings}} for Josh and feels {{the need to}} be there for him when Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believes to be his father) goes missing. Babe supports Josh, talks him down, and tries to be there <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> friend. When it is found that Greg Madden has died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe sticks by Josh and seeks to help him through this. This enrages JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, JR's murder attempt on her, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery looming over their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long-lost sister), JR and Babe begin shutting down on one another. This leads Babe to turn to Josh, confiding in him even more and spending more time with him.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{reinforced}} the Emperor's {{decision for the}} decisive military campaign Champa was the refusal of Chế Bồng Nga to pay tribute for Đại Việt, afterwards historical books reveal that actually king of Champa did send fifteen trays of gold to Đại Việt but Đỗ Tử Bình, official responsible for the southern border, kept the gold for himself while reported to royal court {{that there was not}} any tribute from Champa. In December 1376, Duệ Tông personally commanded an army of 12.000 Đại Việt soldiers operating towards Champa while Hồ Quý Ly took charge of the campaign's logistics and Đỗ Tử Bình conducted the reargoard. On January 23 of Lunar calendar, 1377, Duệ Tông's army arrived at Thị Nại near the capital of Champa Đồ Bàn. In a plot of luring the opponent to his trap in Đồ Bàn, Chế Bồng Nga had a small mandarin pretend to surrender who made Duệ Tông believe that Champa's army had fled from the empty capital. The next day, Duệ Tông led his army directly to the ambush that Chế Bồng Nga prepared <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Trần army was heavily defeated in this Battle of Đồ Bàn where the Emperor himself was killed in action with many other high-ranking mandarins, generals and seventy percent of his troops. On the contrary, Hồ Quý Ly and Đỗ Tử Bình survived because they both ran away from the battle instead of trying to rescue the Emperor. Afterwards, Đỗ Tử Bình was only dismissed to the position of plain soldier by the order of Nghệ Tông while Hồ Quý Ly even did not have to face with any charge.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamza was {{captured}} in the battle {{as well as his}} staff. Francesco Sansovino, in Historia universale dell'origine et imperio de'Turchi, states that Hamza, [...] fearing punitive measures, begged for mercy, arguing that he had only fought against Skanderbeg since he had been ordered to. According to Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's earliest biographers, Skanderbeg responded {{in such a way that}} the Ottoman officers began to cry and he offered to have dinner with them. After this, he ordered for his prisoners to be put under guard and to be treated properly. The men were freed in the end, but Hamza and his staff were ransomed for 13,000 ducats. Franco reports that Skanderbeg's magnanimity became known throughout Albania and the Ottoman Empire to the point where many of his men gained much more respect <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warrior. Skanderbeg's intention in doing so was to show that he would not take advantage of the unfortunate and that he had enough confidence in his ability to let his enemies fight him again another day.|$|E
500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions.

We think we have a happy medium now <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver."
