The modified D.Va was [...] {{heavier than the}} D.III but the structural problems were not entirely cured. Use of the high-compression 130kW (180hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü engine offset the increased weight of the D.Va.

The wings of the D.III and D.Va were interchangeable. To further strengthen the wing, the D.Va added a small <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> connecting the forward interplane strut to {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing; the brace was also retrofitted to some D.Vs.|$|E

2500|$|The major {{activity}} {{for the day}} was mission's first spacewalk (EVA 1) by astronauts Foreman and Satcher. Foreman, the lead spacewalker wore a suit with solid red stripes while Satcher wore an all-white spacesuit. Inside the space station Atlantis Mission Specialist Randolph Bresnik choreographed the activities and coordinated communications between the spacewalkers and Mission Control. Since Foreman and Satcher completed their chores nearly two hours ahead of schedule, planners decided to add a [...] "get ahead" [...] task; Satcher to lubricate the Kibo robotic arm snares while Foreman to route a LAN cable on Zarya and mate power cables on a patch panel at the S0 truss. Towards the end of EVA 1, while deploying the Payload Attach System (PAS) on the Earth-facing side of the Starboard 3 truss, the crew had difficulty loosening a bolt and removing a <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> on the PAS. After hammering on a bolt and wiggling the brace, they successfully deployed the PAS and reinstalled the brace. The spacewalk marked: 228th spacewalk conducted by U.S. astronauts, the 134th in support of space station assembly and maintenance, 106th spacewalk out of the space station, the fourth for Foreman and the first for Satcher.|$|E

50|$|Building length: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Length is {{primarily}} {{limited by the}} ability of the load path to transfer loads to a vertical brace system (e.g. gable endwall). Building length can be extended with added discrete brace systems (e.g. roof level horizontal brace, portal frame, <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace,</b> interior partition shear wall).|$|E
5000|$|A {{queen post}} bridge has two upright queen posts on either side, each placed {{about one-third of}} the way along the span, {{connected}} across the top by a beam. (In comparison, each side of a king post bridge has a single king post {{in the center of the}} span.) A <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> runs between the top of the queen post and the outer edge. [...] Queen post bridges can span greater distances than single-upright king post bridges.|$|E
5000|$|A queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed {{about one-third}} of the way from each end of the truss.

The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two diagonal braces for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two diagonal braces may either reach from the bottom of each upright post {{to the center of the}} upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner [...] "X" [...] inside the square.|$|E
50|$|Modern light-frame {{structures}} usually gain {{strength from}} rigid panels (plywood and other plywood-like composites such as {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) used to form {{all or part of}} wall sections) but until recently carpenters employed various forms of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> to stabilize walls. <b>Diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and in-wall wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual state laws in the United States.

40|$|AbstractBolker and Crapo [4] {{studied the}} {{possibilities}} of applying <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> to rigidify a special bar and joint framework, the so called one-story building. Apparently, one of their ultimate goals was to solve the more general problem of the cubic grids. Some partial results towards this end were published in Bolker [2], who characterized the circuits of the describing matroid. However, his result is not completely satisfactory from the algorithmic point of view, since one still cannot decide whether a given set of <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> makes the cubic grid rigid. In the present note we give {{a necessary condition for}} this, using matroid partition algorithm. This result also enables one to efficiently find a minimal set of braces meeting this condition; even an optimal one with respect to a weight function (say, when the costs of the possible <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> are different). Finally we give an example which shows that the condition is not sufficient...|$|R

A similar structured building, 780 Third Avenue in New York City, was completed in 1983. Onterie Center is the first concrete high-rise in the world to use diagonal shearwalls at the building perimeter. This type of design uses fewer columns and allows for a distinct unit layout. In 1986 this building won the Best Structure Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois.|$|E

50|$|In {{the past}} two decades the steel plate shear wall (SPSW), also known as the steel plate wall (SPW), has been used in a number of {{buildings}} in Japan and North America as part of the lateral force resisting system. In earlier days, SPSWs were treated like vertically oriented plate girders and design procedures tended to be very conservative. Web buckling was prevented through extensive stiffening or by selecting an appropriately thick web plate, until more information became available on the post-buckling characteristics of web plates. Although the plate girder theory seems appropriate for the design of an SPW structure, a very important difference is the relatively high bending strength and stiffness of the beams and columns that form the boundary elements of the wall. These members are expected to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall behaviour of a building incorporating this type of system and several researchers have focused on this aspect of SPWs. The energy dissipating qualities of the web plate under extreme cyclic loading has raised the prospect of using SPSWs as a promising alternative to conventional systems in high-risk seismic regions. A further benefit is that the diagonal tension field of the web plate acts like a <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> in a braced frame and thus completes the truss action, which is known to be an efficient means to control wind drift.|$|E
5000|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the CFM F108-powered KC-135R tanker, the KC-135R MDS was applied in July 1967 to the three KC-135A reconnaissance aircraft under the Rivet Stand program name. The three aircraft were 55-3121, 59-1465, and 59-1514; a fourth, serial no. 58-0126, was converted in 1969 to replace 1465 which had crashed in 1967. Externally the aircraft had varied configurations throughout their careers, but generally they were distinguished by five [...] "towel bar" [...] antennas along the spine of the upper fuselage and a radome below the forward fuselage. The first three aircraft retained the standard tanker nose radome, while 58-0126 was fitted with the 'hog nose' radome commonly associated with an RC-135. A trapeze-like structure in place of the refueling boom which was used to trail an aerodynamic shape housing a specialized receiver array (colloquially known as a [...] "blivet") on a wire was installed. This was reported to be used for [...] "Briar Patch" [...] and [...] "Combat Lion" [...] missions. There were four small optically flat windows on each side of the forward fuselage. On some missions a small wing-like structure housing sensors was fitted to each side of the forward fuselage, with a <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> below it. With the loss of 59-1465, KC-135A 58-0126 was modified to this standard under the Rivet Quick operational name. All four aircraft have now been lost or converted to KC-135R tanker configuration. They are among the few KC-135 tankers equipped with an aerial refueling receptacle above the cockpit, left over from their service as intelligence gathering platforms.|$|E
