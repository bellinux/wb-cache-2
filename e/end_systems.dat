Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that they thought {{they would have to}} mount multiple floodlights on the tower.

Of the six main support towers, three had six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.|$|E

40|$|In an {{internet}} <b>end</b> <b>system,</b> many applications with various requirements on their data stream transmission run simultaneously. The management {{of these data}} streams in a sending <b>end</b> <b>system,</b> and particularly the flow and congestion control for the data streams (if they exist at all), is for each data stream separate and independent from all other data streams. An interesting alternative to such a separate data stream management in a sending <b>end</b> <b>system</b> might be a common data stream management for all data streams in a sending <b>end</b> <b>system.</b> This common data stream management consists of two different aspects improving the overall performance, i. e., the throughput and the fairness, of the data streams of an <b>end</b> <b>system.</b> First, reuse {{of information about the}} current network conditions for an accurate adjustment of connection parameters of other data streams in an <b>end</b> <b>system.</b> This information can be implicitly obtained by some other data streams of the <b>end</b> <b>system</b> and/or explicitly obtained by a network performance probing approach from the <b>end</b> <b>system.</b> And second, a common congestion control between all data streams of an <b>end</b> <b>system</b> including TCP and UDP traffic.

25|$|Conversely, {{the review}} in the Australian version of GamePro voiced a {{negative}} opinion on the game, giving Supreme Commander a rating of five out of ten. GamePro assessed Supreme Commander as an over-ambitious game, with performance (measured in frames per second), even on high <b>end</b> <b>systems,</b> as a major negative point. The reviewers observed that the game gradually slowed down while playing, and that this process accelerated when using the 'shift' key view.

25|$|Two systems {{exist for}} the {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of 2-substituted quinolines with isolated yields generally greater than 80% and ee values generally greater than 90%. The first is an iridium(I)/chiral phosphine/I2 system, first reported by Zhou et al. While the first chiral phosphine used in this system was MeOBiPhep, newer iterations have focused on improving the performance of this ligand. To this <b>end,</b> <b>systems</b> use phosphines (or related ligands) with improved air stability, recyclability, ease of preparation, lower catalyst loading and the potential role of achiral phosphine additives. As of October 2012 no mechanism {{appears to have been}} proposed, although both the necessity of I2 or a halogen surrogate and the possible role of the heteroaromatic N in assisting reactivity have been documented.|$|E
500|$|The {{lighting}} {{was designed}} by Cohen and his partner in Steve Cohen Productions, Joel Young, {{who served as the}} tour's lighting director. Cohen continued saying, [...] "All of our shows [...] heavily color-based—everything is rich in color. There is a lot of layering that is not confusing so the purity comes through". Young programmed the show on a Flying Pig Systems Wholehog II console, which he ran while simultaneously calling the 13 followspots for each show. There were eight truss spots and five house spots: four Lycian 2.5kW instruments on the back, four Robert Juliats on the front truss, four FOH spots and one in the back." [...] Steve Cohen Productions also served as the tour's lighting vendor and sublet the gear they required from Westsun and Fourth Phase/LSD. Syncrolite provided its own 3k lights. Apart from the Syncrolites, the rest of the lighting was a combination of Coemar and High <b>End</b> <b>Systems</b> automated fixtures and conventional luminaries. There were a total of 215 active lights.|$|E

50|$|Split TCP is {{typically}} used to solve TCP problems with large round-trip delay times. A typical system uses Split TCP PEPs to improve TCP performance over a satellite link. Split TCP functions by breaking the end-to-end connection into multiple connections and using different parameters to transfer data across the different legs. The <b>end</b> <b>systems</b> use standard TCP with no modifications, {{and do not}} need to know of the existence of the PEPs in between. Split TCP intercepts TCP connections from the <b>end</b> <b>systems</b> and terminates them. This allows the <b>end</b> <b>systems</b> to run unmodified and can overcome some problems with TCP window sizes on the <b>end</b> <b>systems</b> being set too low for satellite communications.|$|E

40|$|One big {{difference}} between Internet telephony and the public switched telephony network (PSTN) is that the PSTN usually assumes dumb endpoints, while Internet telephony has intelligent endpoints that can perform services. Performing services on endpoints may introduce many new communication services, make telecommunication services more distributed, and make the entire telecommunication network more robust and efficient. At the same time, it may also make telecommunication services more difficult to manage and require new techniques to create and compose services. In this paper, we first introduce a new scripting language, called the Language for <b>End</b> <b>System</b> Services (LESS), which we define specifically for <b>end</b> <b>system</b> service creation. LESS is extended from the Call Processing Language (CPL) and uses a tree-like structure to represent telecommunication services. Based on this tree structure, we propose a method based on LESS action conflict tables and a tree merging algorithm to detect potential feature interactions and help to resolve any conflicts detected. We integrated the method for handling feature interactions into our LESS-based <b>end</b> <b>system</b> service creation environment, {{which is part of}} our Session Initiation Protocol- (SIP) based user agent, SIPc. SIPc can execute LESS scripts for <b>end</b> <b>system</b> services and contains a service manager that can handle feature interactions. ...|$|R
