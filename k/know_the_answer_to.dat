25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do know the answer, when presented with questions they feel they should <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to.</b> This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to.</b> In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absolute}} or infinite—the unconditioned {{ground and}} {{source of all}} reality—is yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousness—under its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by Sir W Hamilton in the Edinburgh Review of 1829, and it was animadverted upon {{about the same time}} by Schelling. Hamilton's objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the same—that the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these [...] " [...] the positive alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself." [...] A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton's objection which has been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that which you do not <b>know?</b> <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this is {{that in the case of}} contradictory statements—A and not A—the latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positive—i.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of the Logic. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence, which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolute—they are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin's absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these—in a word, a mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamilton's criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton's doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere—theodicy.|$|E
