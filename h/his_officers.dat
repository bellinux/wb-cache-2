5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already {{occurred}} to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with <b>his</b> <b>officers,</b> they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} commander at Taizhou ordered his officer Zhai Yong to escort Choe Bu's Korean {{party to the}} regional command centre at Shaoxing on March 6. From there they could be transferred to provincial authorities at Hangzhou and finally to the empire's capital of Beijing where the party could be officially escorted back to Korea. Choe Bu and <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> were carried in sedan chairs, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots of rough terrain Choe Bu and <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> were forced to walk on foot like the others.|$|E

5|$|Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. Against the advice of <b>his</b> <b>officers,</b> Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) {{reads the}} Bixby letter to <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> before giving {{the order to}} find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three {{brothers}} died in battle.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Magheru, {{upon the}} advice of Colquhoun, ordered the demobilization of his troops (October 10), and, {{accompanied}} by a few of <b>his</b> <b>officers,</b> passed the Southern Carpathians into Hermannstadt—at the time, the Transylvanian city was nominally in the Austrian Empire, but gripped by the Hungarian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The fire on Yorktown {{from the}} allies was heavier than ever as new {{artillery}} pieces joined the line. Cornwallis talked with <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> {{that day and}} they agreed that their situation was hopeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey was}} rich in {{scientific}} results. However, {{the relationship between}} the Forsters and Cook and <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} court-martial at Port Royal on 3 September {{ruled that}} a sudden change in the current after dark had caused the loss. The board acknowledged that Pamplin had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated him and <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> from blame both {{for the loss of}} Lowestoffe and the vessels in convoy.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E

5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} <b>his</b> <b>officers.</b> Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. They {{were able to}} bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Ryan {{had already}} pardoned four death row inmates: Madison Hobley, Aaron Patterson, Leroy Orange and Stanley Howard, who {{were among the}} ten who claimed they were coerced into confessing by Burge and <b>his</b> <b>officers</b> and had been wrongfully convicted. In the unusual proceeding, the {{governor}} took the extraordinary step of a direct pardon release rather than a court proceeding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by <b>his</b> <b>officers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some airtime to explain his actions.
