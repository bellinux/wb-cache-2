The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness separated them, {{and that no one}} alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but De Soto sent them home upon realizing there was no <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> through the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{were less}} enthused about the game's user interface, {{and found that}} many {{gameplay}} details went unexplained. IGN's Jose Otero found the inventory management system, which lacks an <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> to sort items, to be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared to move toward the Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received news that the Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that he thought was much larger than his while having no <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E

5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E

5|$|With no <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> {{to cross}} the river, Castañeda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 meters) from the river. Three Texians hurried to bury the cannon, while others {{traveled}} to nearby communities to ask for assistance. By {{the end of the}} day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus. Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.|$|E
