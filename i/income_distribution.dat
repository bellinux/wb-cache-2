5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in <b>income</b> <b>distribution,</b> as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues {{of control and}} equitable <b>income</b> <b>distribution.</b> During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{preference}} reversals {{both for}} lotteries and <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> {{as well as}} their interrelationship. In doing so, it offers several new features: Firstly, it provides a joint analysis of lotteries and <b>income</b> <b>distributions.</b> Secondly, the stimulus material used is considerably more general than used so far in the analysis of preference reversal. Instead of relying on binary lotteries and <b>income</b> <b>distributions,</b> we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized $-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellón, Spain. Subjects were asked both to rate and evaluate the ten lotteries or the ten <b>income</b> <b>distributions,</b> respectively. We found heavy response-mode effects which confirm classical preference reversal, and revealed new patterns of preference reversal. Further, the transfer principle was largely violated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative {{experimental study of}} risky prospects (lotteries) and <b>income</b> <b>distributions.</b> The experimental design consisted of multi?outcome lotteries and n?dimensional <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> arranged in the shapes of ten distributions which were judged in terms of ratings and valuations, respectively. Material incentives applied. We found heavy response?mode effects, which cause inconsistent behavior between rating and valuation of lotteries and <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> in more than 50 % of all cases. This means that ethical inequality measures lack support in peoples? perceptions. In addition to classical preference reversals between generalized P?bets and $?bets we observed three additional patterns of preference reversal, two of which apply only to <b>income</b> <b>distributions.</b> Dominating Lorenz curves and Lorenz curves cutting others from below receive decidedly higher ratings (which implies risk and inequality aversion), but lower valuations. The transfer principle is largely violated. The rating of lotteries is a decreasing function of skewness, the rating of <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> is a decreasing function of standard deviation. The valuation of lotteries is an increasing function of standard deviation and kurtosis, and the valuation of <b>income</b> <b>distributions</b> is an increasing function of standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
