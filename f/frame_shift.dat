There may be a link between diseases caused by polyglutamine and polyalanine expansion mutations, as frame shifting of the original SCA3 gene product encoding CAG/polyglutamines to GCA/polyalanines. Ribosomal slippage during translation of the SCA3 protein has been proposed as the mechanism resulting in shifting from the polyglutamine to the polyalanine-encoding frame. A dinucleotide deletion or single nucleotide insertion within the polyglutamine tract of huntingtin exon 1 would shift the CAG, polyglutamineen coding frame by +1 (+1 <b>frame</b> <b>shift)</b> to the GCA, polyalanine-encoding frame and introduce a novel epitope to the C terminus of Htt exon 1 (APAAAPAATRPGCG).|$|E

This fact is used in the spatial domain for PSF estimation, and in the temporal domain for estimation of global <b>frame</b> <b>shifts.</b> First few singular vectors contain less noise. This fact is further improved by averaging operation. Magnitude functions of PSF first singular vectors are estimated byaveraging of corresponding first few singular vectors of degraded image. Estimation of global <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> uses corresponding first few singular vectors of consecutive frames.

40|$|Abstract — Sequencing {{technologies}} used {{to generate}} long strands of DNA are susceptible to laboratory errors that may result in several DNA nucleotides being deleted from the genome. Detecting such deletions in the protein coding regions is of utmost importance. Missing even a single nucleotide may lead to <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> with all the following codons (and consequently the encoded amino acids) being identified incorrectly. In addition to the deletion of nucleotides during sequencing, <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> can occur because {{of a variety of}} other reasons including mutations. In this paper, we present a fast computational technique to identify <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> in protein coding regions in DNA sequences. Our technique is based on Fourier spectral characteristics of coding regions in DNA sequences. We provide two applications of our technique – detecting deletions in DNA sequences in coding regions and also detecting <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> in viral DNA...|$|R

2500|$|A {{frameshift}} mutation (also called a framing error or a reading <b>frame</b> <b>shift)</b> is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) {{of a number}} of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can change the reading frame (the grouping of the codons), resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein. A {{frameshift mutation}} {{is not the same as}} a single-nucleotide polymorphism in which a nucleotide is replaced, rather than inserted or deleted. A frameshift mutation will in general cause the reading of the codons after the mutation to code for different amino acids. The frameshift mutation will also alter the first stop codon ("UAA", [...] "UGA" [...] or [...] "UAG") encountered in the sequence. The polypeptide being created could be abnormally short or abnormally long, and will most likely not be functional.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{research}} aspiring to {{better understanding of the}} design process, the activity of imposing order on the design situation, termed problem framing, has been studied extensively since it was eloquently, but informally, characterised as a phenomenon by Schön in writings starting in the 1980 s. Much work investigating problem framing takes a cognitive approach, focusing on it as a critical component of an individual designer’s approach to a design task. This publication first extends notions about 'individual' reflective practice to account for problem framing among design 'teams' working on the conceptual stages of design projects. It presents an approach to identifying problem frames characterised as being negotiated conversationally among design team members during collaboration on a design task. The paper argues that by viewing team design conversations as a process of 'argumentation', the negotiation of frames is brought into focus. Analysing designers’ interactions in this way allows us to see how <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> happen. This is an important step towards clarifying the phenomenon of problem framing and the way that frames become established (or not) in design teams, and it is a pre-requisite for investigating the consequential effects on both the design process and design outcomes. The work explains how argumentation theory, applied within an experiential learning paradigm, can be applied to analysis of design team conversations. It uses examples from design meeting transcripts to show how <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> can be detected by focusing on rhetorical schemes as markers of reality construction. Transcripts can thereby be structured into episodes showing the negotiation of terms. One advantage of the approach described is the inter-coder reliability achievable in identifying <b>frame</b> <b>shifts,</b> thus it presents some novel advantages over other more informal work concerned with describing problem framing in design teams (e. g. the work of Dorst and Valkenburg) ...|$|R
40|$|Unambiguous {{sequence}} variant descriptions {{are important in}} reporting the outcome of clinical diagnostic DNA tests. The standard nomenclature of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) describes the observed variant sequence relative to a given reference sequence.

Additional applications include updating of gene variant database contents and reference sequence liftovers.

40|$|Motivation: Novel {{sequencing}} {{techniques can}} give access to organisms {{that are difficult}} to cultivate using conventional methods. When applied to environmental samples, the data generated has some drawbacks, e. g. short length of assembled contigs, in-frame stop codons and <b>frame</b> <b>shifts.</b> Unfortunately, current gene finders cannot circumvent these difficulties. At the same time, the automated prediction of genes is a prerequisite for the increasing amount of genomic sequences to ensure progress in metagenomics. Results: We introduce a novel gene finding algorithm that incorporates features overcoming the short length of the assembled contigs from environmental data, in-frame stop codons as well as <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> contained in bacterial sequences. The results show that by searching for sequence similarities in an environmental sample our algorithm is capable of detecting a high fraction of its gene content, depending on the species composition and the overall size of the sample. The method is valuable for hunting novel unknown genes that may be specific for the habitat where the sample is taken. Finally, we show that our algorithm can even exploit the limited information contained in the short reads generated by 454 technology for the prediction of protein coding genes...|$|R

In this study, we present a self adaptive spectral rotation (SASR) approach, which visualizes coding regions in DNA sequences, based on investigation of the Triplet Periodicity property, without any preceding training process.

Applications of the SASR on real DNA data show that patterns in the graphic output reveal locations of the coding regions and the <b>frame</b> <b>shifts</b> between them: arcs indicate coding regions, stable points indicate non-coding regions and corners’ shapes reveal <b>frame</b> <b>shifts.</b> Tests on genomic data set from Saccharomyces Cerevisiae reveal that the graphic patterns for coding and non-coding regions differ to a great extent, so that the coding regions can be visually distinguished.
