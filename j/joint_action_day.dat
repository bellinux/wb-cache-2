40|$|Humans {{are social}} beings {{and they often}} act jointly {{together}} with other humans (<b>joint</b> <b>actions)</b> rather than alone. Successful <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> requires the understanding and the coordination of ones own actions with another persons actions. The research attempts to advance our knowledge about <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination by extending existing research in two novel and important ways. First, prominent theories of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> agree on visual information being critical for successful <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination but are vague about the exact source of visual information being used during a <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> However, in a real life interaction several sources of visual information exist which inform an interaction partner about the ongoing course of the interaction (e. g. visual information about objects, tools, other persons). Knowing which sources of visual information are used, however, is important {{for a more detailed}} characterization of the functioning of <b>action</b> coordination in <b>joint</b> <b>actions.</b> Second, previous studies investigating the role of visual information in social settings often constrain the experimental tasks to artificial laboratory settings. To examine <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> mechanisms under realistic conditions I devised experimental tasks that allowed a close-to-natural <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> As a result the perceptual and motor components of the experimental tasks were less constrained allowing for a more natural interaction compared to previous studies. The current research examines the importance of different sources of visual information on <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination under realistic settings. In three studies I examined the influence of different sources of visual information (Study 1), the functional role of different sources of visual information (Study 2), and the effect of social context on the use of visual information (Study 3) in a table tennis game. The results of these studies revealed that (1) visual anticipation of the interaction partner and the interaction object is critical in natural <b>joint</b> <b>actions,</b> (2) different sources of visual information are critical at different temporal phases during the <b>joint</b> <b>action,</b> and (3) the social context modulates the importance of different sources of visual information. In sum, this work provides important and new empirical evidence about the importance of different sources of visual information in close-to-natural <b>joint</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

40|$|From {{early in}} life, young {{children}} eagerly engage in social interactions. Yet, {{they still have}} difficulties in performing well-coordinated <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> with others. Adult literature suggests that two processes are important for smooth <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination: action prediction and inhibitory control. The aim {{of the current study}} was to disentangle the potential role of these processes in the early development of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination. Using a simple turn-taking game, we assessed 2 -year-old toddlers' <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination, focusing on timing variability and turn-taking accuracy. In two additional tasks, we examined their action prediction capabilities with an eye-tracking paradigm and examined their inhibitory control capabilities with a classic executive functioning task (gift delay task). We found that individual differences in action prediction and inhibitory action control were distinctly related to the two aspects of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination. Toddlers who showed more precision in their action predictions were less variable in their action timing during the joint play. Furthermore, toddlers who showed more inhibitory control in an individual context were more accurate in their turn-taking performance during the <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> On the other hand, no relation between timing variability and inhibitory control or between turn-taking accuracy and action prediction was found.

Previous research has shown that in adults the involvement of one’s own motor system is enhanced during observation of an action partner as compared to during observation of an individual actor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether similar motor system involvement is present at early stages of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> development and whether it is related to <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> performance. In an EEG experiment with 3 -year-old children, we assessed the children’s brain activity and performance during a joint game with an adult experimenter. We used a simple button-pressing game in which the two players acted in turns.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} {{philosophy of}} collective intentionality, emotions, feelings, moods, and sentiments do not figure prominently in debates on the explanation and justification of <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> Received philosophical theories analyze <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> {{in terms of}} common knowledge of cognitively complex, interconnected structures of intentions and action plans of the participants.

In contrast, minimalist theorists pay some attention to affective elements in <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> without much concern about their collective intentionality.

In this paper, we outline an account of collective emotions that can bridge this theoretical divide, linking the intentional structure of <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> and the underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms.
