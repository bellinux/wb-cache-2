However, flexible but uncoordinated travel behaviors exacerbate traffic congestion. Mobile phone records not only reveal human mobility patterns, but also enable us to manage travel demand <b>for</b> <b>system</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In this paper, we propose a location recommendation system that infers personal preferences while accounting for constraints imposed by road capacity in order to manage travel demand. We first infer unobserved preferences using a machine learning technique from phone records. We then formulate an optimization method to improve <b>system</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Coupling mobile phone data with traffic counts and road network infrastructures collected in Andorra, this study shows that uncoordinated travel behaviors lead to longer average travel delay, implying the opportunities in managing travel demand by collective decisions. The interplay between congestion relief and overall satisfied location preferences observed in extensive simulations indicate that moderate sacrifices of individual utility lead to significant travel time savings. Specifically, {{the results show that}} under full compliance rate, travel delay fell by 52 % at a cost of 31 % less satisfaction.

40|$|Computer algebra systems, such as Axiom, and {{programming}} languages designed for computer algebra, such as Aldor, have very flexible mechanisms for generic code, with type parameterization. Modern versions of Maple can support {{this style of}} programming {{through the use of}} Maple's module system, and by using module-producing functions to give parametric type constructors. From the software design point of view, generic programming allows better code re-usability so main-stream programming languages, such as C++ and Java, have evolved to support it. Computer algebra programs that use parametric polymorphism tend to do so very heavily, leading to deeply nested type constructions. Optimization of deeply nested type constructions thus becomes an important problem <b>for</b> <b>system</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The goal of the current work is to present optimizations for this situation.
