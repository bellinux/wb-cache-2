5|$|Encouraged {{by artist}} <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent,</b> Sands studied {{painting}} in Paris at the Académie Carrière under Eugène Carrière for several years, beginning in 1894. There she met fellow student Nan Hudson, born Anna Hope Hudson in the United States, who became her life partner. During this time, Sands became {{the guardian of}} her two younger brothers following her mother's death in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Amondson split {{his time between}} Vashon Island and Alaska, where he hunted and found landscapes to paint. He cited {{painters}} <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent</b> and Joaquín Sorolla as his artistic influences. In addition, Amondson {{took an interest in}} woodcarving. His life-sized works can be found throughout Vashon Island. Along with painting and woodcarving, Amondson was an avid pie baker and published a book compiling his mother's pie recipes.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Anthony D. G. Pratt {{was influenced}} by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent,</b> Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball.|$|E

After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of the interior is constructed from recycled materials while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certificate. He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent</b> {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a sculpture by Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1880s, Riley {{had been}} the nation's most read poet, a trend that {{accelerated}} {{at the turn of}} the century. In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by Victor Records. Riley was the subject of three paintings by T. C. Steele. The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by world famous painter <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent.</b> Riley's image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade-name in the midwest.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent</b> and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} preparatory oil {{sketches}} for Sad Inheritance were painted {{with the greatest}} luminosity and bravura, and foretold an increasing interest in shimmering light and of a medium deftly handled. Sorolla thought well enough of these sketches that he presented two of them as gifts to American artists; one to <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent,</b> the other to William Merritt Chase. After this painting Sorolla never returned to a theme of such overt social consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Its {{reputation}} {{stems from}} a period in the 19th century when it became a sort of Victorian artists' colony: painters such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, J. M. W. Turner, James McNeill Whistler, William Holman Hunt, and <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent</b> all lived and worked here. There was a particularly large concentration of artists {{in the area around}} Cheyne Walk and Cheyne Row, where the Pre-Raphaelite movement had its heart. The artist Prunella Clough was born in Chelsea in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Armand Hammer was a LACMA {{board member}} for nearly {{seventeen}} years, beginning in 1968, and {{during this time}} continued to announce the museum would inherit his whole collection.

When LACMA was offered a collection of works by Honoré Daumier, Hammer bought the works on the promise that he would give them to the museum.

25|$|From 1922 to 1958, Grand Central Terminal was {{the home}} of the Grand Central Art Galleries, which were {{established}} by <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent,</b> Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others. The founders had sought a location in Manhattan that was central and easily accessible, and Alfred Holland Smith, president of New York Central, made the top of the terminal available. A 10-year lease was signed, and the galleries, together with the railroad company, spent more than $100,000 to prepare the space. The architect was William Adams Delano, best known for designing Yale Divinity School's Sterling Quadrangle.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with his}} {{worsening}} alcoholism, the 1963 Profumo Affair, his mother's death in 1964, and the sudden {{death of his}} half-brother Viscount William Waldorf Astor II in March 1966 may have increased his depression. After years of struggling with depression and suicidal ideation, Bobby Shaw committed suicide on July 10, 1970. He is buried in the chapel at Cliveden. <b>John</b> <b>Singer</b> <b>Sargent</b> painted an oil portrait of Nancy Viscountess Astor in 1909, and also did a 1923 charcoal portrait of RGS III in his military uniform. Nancy gave the portrait to Alfred Edward Goodey, art collector and RGS III's partner. It was sold in England in 2011 for £23,000.|$|E
25|$|The Faure Museum {{is based}} on works {{originally}} from a private collection, that of Dr. Jean Faure (1862-1942).

This museum has the second greatest French collection of works of Rodin with not less than thirty-four sculptures, not counting the master studies. The establishment also displays a collection of paintings concerning impressionism to the public.
