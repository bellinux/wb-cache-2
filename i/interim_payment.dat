5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an <b>interim</b> <b>payment</b> in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2007, Khan {{was convicted}} of {{careless}} driving at Bolton Crown Court and given a six-month driving ban and a £1000 fine. The conviction related to an incident that occurred on 2 March 2006 in the centre of Bolton, when Khan's car hit and broke the leg of Geoffrey Hatton, a pedestrian who was using a pelican crossing while Khan was travelling at 47mph in a 30mph zone and overtaking in the wrong lane. He was cleared of dangerous driving but charged with the lesser offence of careless driving and the pedestrian received an <b>interim</b> <b>payment</b> of £40,000. Geoffrey Hatton never fully recovered from the incident and died two years afterwards from a gastrointestinal bleed with Khan passing on his sympathies.|$|E
25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an <b>interim</b> <b>payment</b> of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.|$|E

25|$|The {{line would}} be single track, and the {{construction}} costs, which included {{the cost of the}} canal, were very favourable compared to other lines. In 1852, construction began at Port Elphinstone, westwards towards Huntly. This ensured that the canal could remain open for as long as possible. Despite the fact that the canal had not yet been bought by the railway, the contractors Erskine and Carstairs cut through the bank at Kintore, and drained the entire upper section from Port Elphinstone to Stoneybank. With the barges grounded, the canal company complained, and the bank was hastily repaired and the canal refilled. Some of the proprietors of the canal agreed to take railway shares in lieu of compensation for their canal shares, and the railway made an <b>interim</b> <b>payment</b> of £20,000, from which claims would be paid to the bondholders and shareholders. In February 1854, the canal company had received £39,272 from the railway, representing the original purchase price plus the interest. In 1848, the mortgage debt and the interest on it was around £18,600. The shareholders had never received any dividends, and thus were unlikely to recover the capital they had invested. The money was distributed without any distinction to holders of the old £50 shares and the new £20 shares.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a gap in}} tort {{recovery}} for many hazardous release victims. Hazardous spill victims receive different damage compensation based solely upon the type of hazardous substance released, with oil spill victims benefitting {{from a number of}} statutory damage recovery mechanisms that victims of other type of hazardous substance releases do not receive. Specifically, those injured by oil spills receive <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> and recover for their economic loss. Yet, many victims injured by non-oil hazardous spills will incur economic harm but will not receive compensation because of a prohibition on {{recovery for}} economic loss absent accompanying physical injury or private property damage. That prohibition on recovery, known as the “pure economic loss rule,” serves as an effective bar to recovery for most spill victims because hazardous releases often damage public natural resources (such as water) rather than private property. This Article articulates normative policy for expanding <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> and pure economic loss recovery to a larger class of private-party hazardous release than just those injured by oil...|$|R

An online questionnaire survey was administered to contractors, subcontractors and consultants for their opinions on the issue. The study found that payment delays and losses are experienced by contractors (10 - 40 %) and subcontractors (10 - 80 %) on the total projects undertaken by them since the CCA implementation. Retention sums are very often delayed while final and <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> are delayed less than often.

60|$|Now {{and then}} for several days {{together}} we sat in our log-built shelter while a blinding snowstorm raged outside and the pines filled the valley with their roaring.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the inter‐relationship between profitability, {{cost of capital}} and capital structure among property developers and contractors in Hong Kong. Whilst major indigenous local developers are among the largest and the most profitable in the world, their contractor counterparts are generally small and nowhere near as profitable. An analysis of financial data suggests that gearing is generally higher among contractors than developers. However, {{it does not mean}} that contractors borrow more than developers. Indeed they do not need to borrow as much as developers even if they have the assets to pledge as collateral. Contractors do not have to pay for high land costs, and they obtain project finance from developers through <b>interim</b> <b>payments</b> in lump sum contracts that are widely adopted in the industry. Their high gearing reflects more their low equity base than high level of debts. Their costs of equities are about double the developers’, probably due to their usually low or negative profit margins. This conclusion is substantiated by further regression analysis of the data. The findings indicate that capital gearing is positively related with asset but negatively with profit margins. This article concludes with a discussion on implications of such profitability divide between the two sectors on the unequal relationship between developers and contractors, and on their competitiveness.
