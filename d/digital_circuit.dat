5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Claude Shannon {{produced}} his master's thesis at MIT that implemented Boolean algebra and binary arithmetic using electronic relays {{and switches}} {{for the first}} time in history. Entitled A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, Shannon's thesis essentially founded practical <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s {{and working}} independently, American {{electronic}} engineer Claude Shannon and Soviet logician Victor Shestakov both showed a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} concepts of Boolean logic and certain electrical circuits, now called logic gates, which are now ubiquitous in digital computers. They showed that electronic relays and switches can realize the expressions of Boolean algebra. This thesis essentially founded practical <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>digital</b> <b>circuit,</b> an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} logic device, a {{programmable logic}} controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays.

One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{theoretical and}} experimental data characterizing {{the sensitivity of}} nMOS and CMOS <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> to substrate coupling in mixed-signal, smart-power systems. The work presented here focuses on the noise effects created by high-power analog circuits and affecting sensitive <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> on the same integrated circuit. The sources and mechanism of the noise behavior of such <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> are identified and analyzed. The results are obtained primarily from a set of dedicated test circuits specifically designed, fabricated, and evaluated for this work. The conclusions drawn from the theoretical and experimental analyses are used to develop physical and circuit design techniques to mitigate the substrate noise problems.

25|$|The two-element Boolean algebra is {{also used}} for circuit design in {{electrical}} engineering; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one bit in a <b>digital</b> <b>circuit,</b> typically high and low voltage. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables {{if and only if}} the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.|$|E
25|$|Shannon {{is noted}} for having founded {{information}} theory with a landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, that he published in 1948. He is, perhaps, equally {{well known for}} founding <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical, numerical relationship. Shannon contributed {{to the field of}} cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|Boole's {{work and}} that of later logicians {{initially}} appeared to have no engineering uses. Claude Shannon attended a philosophy class at the University of Michigan which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could {{form the basis of}} mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers. Victor Shestakov at Moscow State University (1907–1987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than Claude Shannon in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians Sofya Yanovskaya, Gaaze-Rapoport, Roland Dobrushin, Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky, though they presented their academic theses in the same year, 1938. But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the Information Age.|$|E

500|$|For his master's thesis, Bush invented and {{patented}} a [...] "profile tracer", {{a mapping}} device for assisting surveyors. It {{was the first}} of a string of inventions. He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919, and founded the company now known as Raytheon in 1922. Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design theory. Bush became vice president of MIT and dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932, and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938.|$|E

2500|$|A {{biological}} computer {{refers to}} an engineered biological system that can perform computer-like operations, which is a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology. Researchers from around [...] the world, predominantly in the United States, have built and characterized a variety of logic gates {{in a number of}} organisms, as well as demonstrated both analog and digital computation in living cells. For example, research groups have demonstrated that bacteria can be engineered to perform both analog computation or digital computation. In human cells, for example, research by Keller Rinaudo, Leonidas Bleris, Rohan Maddamsetti, Sairam Subramanian, Ron Weiss and Yaakov Benenson demonstrated a universal logic evaluator that operates in mammalian cells in 2007. Subsequently, researchers from MIT and ETH Zurich utilized this paradigm to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapy that uses biological digital computation to detect and kill human cancer cells in 2011. Furtheremore, a group of researchers from MIT, Boston University, and NIST demonstrated in 2016 that using principles of computer engineering, one can automate <b>digital</b> <b>circuit</b> design in bacterial cells. In 2017, researchers from Boston University and ETH Zurich demonstrated the 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (BLADE) system to engineer digital computation in human cells.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design process}} for <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> is {{fundamentally}} different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design. As a consequence, extremely complex <b>digital</b> <b>circuits,</b> with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost. Such <b>digital</b> integrated <b>circuits</b> are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers. As <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> become more complex, issues of time delay, logic races, power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to the density, speed and performance.|$|R

The thesis addresses both of them. LOTOS models for signals, wires, components and component connections are established, together with the behavioural models of digital components in synchronous and asynchronous circuits. These formal models help to build the rigorous specifications of <b>digital</b> <b>circuits,</b> which are not only valuable documentation, but also the bases for further analysis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{implicit}} multistep integration {{algorithms used}} in general purpose circuit simulation programs, like SPICE 2 [1], {{have proved to}} be reliable, but are computa- tionally expensive when applied to large systems. This is because ech step of the numerical integration requires the implicit solution of a large nonlinear algebraic system. If the circuit simulation program is intended for the simulation of mostly MOS <b>digital</b> <b>circuits,</b> then it is possible to exploit the properties of these types of circuits to improve its efficiency. In particular, that MOS <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> can be broken into loosely or uni-directionally coupled subsystems can be exploited by iterative decomposition algorithms, and that the different nodes in an MOS <b>digital</b> <b>circuits</b> change at very different rates can be exploited by multirate integration algorithms.
