5|$|A {{recently}} built sabha-mandapa (assembly-hall) has idols of god Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi. It {{leads to}} central hall {{built by the}} Patwardhan Rulers of Kurundwad. The ceiling of this hall is formed from a single stone. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has a central image of Ganesha as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar, facing the North. The Ganesha <b>image</b> <b>is</b> depicted in a seated posture with its trunk turning to the left, four arms and three eyes. He holds a noose (pasha) and elephant goad (ankusha) in his upper hands, while his lower right rests on his knee {{and the other one}} holds a modaka (a sweet). The navel and the eyes are embedded with diamonds. A cobra hood raised over Ganesha's head, shelters the Lord. The <b>image</b> <b>is</b> actually smaller than it looks as it is smeared with a thick level of saffron-coloured Sindoor (vermillion), which peels off once every century. It last fell off in 1882, and prior to that in 1788. Ganesha is flanked by idols of his consorts Riddhi and Siddhi sometimes called Siddhi and Buddhi. These idols are made of an alloy of five metals or of brass. The deities are covered with crafted silver and gold. Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the central Ganesha <b>image</b> <b>is</b> believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring {{in the form of an}} elephant-faced stone. In front of the central image, the vahanas of Ganesha – the mouse and the peacock are placed. To the left outside the garbhagriha is an image of Nagna-Bhairava.|$|E

50|$|Ayutthaya <b>images</b> <b>were</b> created {{between the}} tenth and eighteenth centuries. They had a unique hair frame and {{tell-tale}} narrow carvings above the lips and eyes. Early Ayutthaya <b>images</b> <b>were</b> carved in stone with heavy influence from the Lopburi images. Middle Ayutthaya <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{similar to the}} Sukhothai <b>images,</b> and <b>were</b> in similar poses. During this period, the <b>images</b> <b>were</b> often cast in Bronze, {{and the size of}} the <b>images</b> <b>were</b> often large. In the late Ayutthaya period, the images typically depicted the Buddha in royal attire, and the bases of the images bore ornate design.|$|R

30|$|For the “Fountain” data set, eleven wide-baseline stereo <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{used in our}} experiments. One stereo <b>image</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} the {{parameter}} selection experiment, presented in Section 3.3. The other ten stereo <b>images</b> <b>were</b> divided into two sub-sets, denoted as Fountain-A and Fountain-B. Each sub-set contained five consecutive images. For each sub-set, one <b>image</b> <b>was</b> considered as the left image while the other four <b>images</b> <b>were</b> considered as the right <b>images.</b> This <b>was</b> repeated five times, giving twenty stereo pairs for each sub-set. For the “HerzJesu” dataset, five <b>images</b> <b>were</b> selected to form another sub-set. In all, {{the first group of}} test data contained 60 stereo pairs. For brevity, we call this set “Fountain and HerzJesu Dataset” hereafter.|$|R
5|$|Ardhanarishvara is {{interpreted}} {{as an attempt to}} syncretise the two principal Hindu sects, Shaivism and Shaktism, dedicated to Shiva and the Great Goddess. A similar syncretic <b>image</b> <b>is</b> Harihara, a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu, the Supreme deity of the Vaishnava sect.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Manasa is worshiped {{without an}} image. A {{branch of a}} tree, an earthen pot or an earthen snake <b>image</b> <b>is</b> worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too. She is worshiped for {{protection}} from and cure of snake bites and infectious diseases like smallpox and chicken pox.|$|E

30|$|The 4 D PET <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{integrated}} {{over time}} to obtain 3 D PET summation images. The PET <b>images</b> <b>were</b> co-registered to the re-oriented, high-resolution T 1 -weighted MRI. The summation PET <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{used to determine the}} co-registration parameters (rotation and translation required). The co-registered PET <b>images</b> <b>were</b> re-sliced to a voxel size of 2 × 2 × 2 mm. The spatial processing of MR and PET <b>images</b> <b>was</b> performed in SPM 5 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, UK).|$|R
50|$|The <b>images</b> <b>are</b> {{of differing}} sizes, {{range from about}} nine to {{eighteen}} inches tall. Being essentially solid gold, the <b>images</b> <b>are</b> extremely heavy. It is believed that the Buddha <b>images</b> <b>were</b> brought to Inlay Lake by King Alaungsithu.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It {{is often}} {{required}} in image processing to embed multiple images {{in a single}} image. These <b>images</b> may <b>be</b> invisible in host image depending upon bit position. In this paper bit planes of an <b>image</b> <b>are</b> extracted using Bit Plane slicing Technique (BPS) and two <b>images</b> <b>are</b> embedded into a single image. The individual bit planes of cameraman <b>image</b> <b>are</b> also shown and later on properties of bit planes of an <b>image</b> <b>are</b> also discussed...|$|R
5|$|It is {{important}} to also note that images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the <b>image</b> <b>is</b> found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to reach. For example, in a women’s magazine such as Good Housekeeping, one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.|$|E

30|$|All <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} using a dual-detector gamma camera (Millennium MG, General Electric, Elgems, Tirat Carmel, Israel) {{equipped with}} a parallel hole, low-energy, high-resolution collimator. Energy discrimination was provided by a 20  % window centered at 140  keV. Thirty-two <b>images</b> <b>were</b> obtained over a 180 ° arc. Each <b>image</b> <b>was</b> acquired over 30  s. The data were stored on a 64 [*]×[*] 64 matrix. A series of 6.78 -mm-thick contiguous trans-axial <b>images</b> <b>were</b> reconstructed with a filtered back-projection algorithm without attenuation correction. These trans-axial <b>images</b> <b>were</b> then reoriented in the short axis, vertical long axis, and horizontal long axis of the left ventricle.|$|R
40|$|An <b>image</b> can <b>be</b> {{retrieved}} from number of features contained in it. But {{it depends upon}} its format, which features are best selected for the proper retrieval. In this paper, the RGB, HSV, YIQ and dithered <b>images</b> <b>are</b> retrieved using two computational retrieval techniques; DCT and Wavelet decomposition. When used DCT transformation technique, only HSV <b>images</b> <b>are</b> giving the best results, while when Wavelet transformation is used, the HSV, Dithered and YIQ <b>images</b> <b>are</b> giving satisfactory results, out of which from the accuracy point of view, HSV <b>images</b> <b>are</b> having maximum degree of accuracy in correct retrieval. After analysis, {{it is found that}} in DCT as well as in Wavelet decomposition techniques, the HSV <b>images</b> <b>are</b> correctly retrieved...|$|R
50|$|The iconographies of the yogini {{images in}} four yogini temples are not uniform. In the Hirapur temple, all yogini <b>images</b> <b>are</b> with their vahanas (vehicles) and in {{standing}} posture. In Ranipur-Jharial temple the yogini <b>images</b> <b>are</b> in dancing posture. In Bhedaghat temple, yogini <b>images</b> <b>are</b> seated in Lalitasana.|$|R

30|$|Four {{kinds of}} {{subtracted}} <b>images</b> <b>were</b> generated. First, the control <b>image</b> <b>was</b> subtracted from the C 1 image to confirm similarity. Because {{there was no}} clear difference, the C 1 <b>image</b> <b>was</b> defined as a standard, and three kinds of subtraction imaging (C 1 –C 3, C 1 –C 4, and C 1 –C 5) <b>were</b> performed. Paired <b>images</b> <b>were</b> visually aligned with the reference to an outline of the skull and cropped to the same size by customized software (Image Rugle 2009 Medic Engineering Inc., Kyoto, Japan). After processing, the <b>images</b> <b>were</b> subtracted by Adobe Photoshop CS 6 software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA).|$|R
30|$|The {{results showed}} that 93  % of the {{processed}} half-time images and 98  % of the standard <b>images</b> <b>were</b> rated as sufficient or good with regard to lesion detectability. The processed half-time <b>images</b> <b>were</b> predominately considered sufficient (65  %), whereas {{the majority of the}} standard <b>images</b> <b>were</b> graded as good (83  %). The performance of the algorithm was unaffected by patient size as the average grading of all half-time processed <b>images</b> <b>was</b> constant independent of patient BMI. The comparison study showed that the standard <b>images</b> <b>were</b> rated superior with regard to lesion detectability, image noise, and artifacts, in 32, 65, and 23  % of the evaluations, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form the eyes are encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in web pages rather than stored as a separate file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a binary <b>image</b> <b>is</b> base64-encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it as a standard. Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E
