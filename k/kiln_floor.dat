50|$|The Middle Bay Brick Kiln is a {{historical}} archaeological site on Kodiak Island, Alaska. Located on an eroding bluff face on Middle Bay, the site contains {{the remains of a}} brickmaking facility established by the Russian American Company, probably in the early 19th century. The remains include a 4 x 4 m Roman-style kiln, with a series of arches that supported the <b>kiln</b> <b>floor</b> and provided a space for the fire. At the time of the site's first major excavation in 1979, elements of at least one arch were in danger of being undermined by the eroding bluff face, and were removed for potential reconstruction by the Kodiak Historical Society. Other notable finds at the site include hand cut nails and a brick with Russian writing on it.|$|E

30|$|Two {{articles}} in the special issue are related to paleointensity studies. Yamamoto et al. (2015) presented an archeointensity study on baked clay samples taken from a reconstructed ancient kiln. Application of the Tsunakawa–Shaw method to the samples showed that those obtained from the floor surface of the kiln provided accurate archeointensity results. These samples mainly consisted of Ti-poor titanomagnetite grains, approximately 10  nm in size, with SD and/or SP states. They concluded that baked clay samples from a <b>kiln</b> <b>floor</b> {{are considered to be}} ideal materials for archeointensity studies.|$|E
30|$|Application of the Tsunakawa-Shaw {{method to}} the baked clay samples {{taken from a}} reconstructed kiln shows that the samples from floor surface provide the {{accurate}} archeointensity results.

30|$|To {{avoid the}} less-fired and/or unfired parts, we used only the {{surficial}} {{parts of the}} blocks (within 1.5  cm from the <b>kiln</b> <b>floor)</b> for experiments. For AFD measurements, each 1.5 -cm cubic specimen was cut from the block samples and then placed into a 7 -cm 3 plastic case with paper clay. For measurements of archeointensity and ThD, a 1.5 -cm 3 specimen cut from the block samples was placed into a silica glass case with glass wool and high-temperature cement. For the magnetic and mineralogical experiments, crushed specimens were prepared from the block samples. In the archeodirection measurements, the declination collection was set to be −[*] 7.3 °, based on the IGRF- 12 model (International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, Working Group V-MOD 2010).|$|E

30|$|In 1972, a {{reconstruction}} experiment of a kiln {{had been done}} to reproduce an excavated kiln of the seventh century in Japan. Baked clay samples were taken from the floor surface and − 20 cm level, and they have been stored after determinations of the paleomagnetic directions by partial alternating field demagnetizations. We recently applied the Tsunakawa-Shaw method to the samples to assess how reliable archeointensity results are obtained from the samples. A suite of the rock magnetic experiments and the scanning electron microscope observations elucidate that dominant magnetic carriers of the floor surface samples are Ti-poor titanomagnetite grains in approximately 10 nm size with single-domain and/or super-paramagnetic states, whereas contributions of multi-domain grains seem to be relatively large for the − 20 -cm level samples. From the floor surface samples, six out of the eight successful results were obtained and they give an average of 47.3 μT {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.2 μT. This is fairly consistent with the in situ geomagnetic field of 46.4 μT at the time of the reconstruction. They are obtained with a built-in anisotropy correction using anhysteretic remanent magnetization and without any cooling rate corrections. In contrast, only one out of four was successful from the − 20 -cm level samples. It yields an archeointensity of 31.6 μT, which is inconsistent with the in situ geomagnetic field. Considering from the in situ temperature record during the firing of the kiln and the unblocking temperature spectra of the samples, the floor surface samples acquired full thermoremanent magnetizations (TRMs) as their natural remanent magnetizations whereas the − 20 -cm level samples only acquired partial TRMs, and these differences probably cause the difference in the archeointensity results between the two sample groups. For archeointensity researches, baked clay samples from a <b>kiln</b> <b>floor</b> are considered to be ideal materials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of wollastonite and dolomite on melting behaviour and crystallization was studied for 25 raw glazes. The melting behaviour was observed by hot-stage microscopy. The glazes were also fired industrially both in a fast-fired gas <b>kiln</b> for <b>floor</b> tiles (50 min) {{and in a}} traditional gas kiln for sanitaryware (25 hours). The surface composition {{and structure of the}} glazes were studied by SEM/EDXA. The crystalline phases in the glazes were identified by XRD. Main crystalline phases found in the glazes were wollastonite and diopside. Fusibility and surface structure on the raw glazes containing wollastonite and dolomite as raw materials depended both on the total content and the ratio of CaO and MgO in the glaze. Low content of alkaline earths gave incomplete fusion, while high content gave extensive crystallization. The results can be applied to tailor raw glaze compositions for a desired surface structure to be fired at a certain fusion temperature...|$|R
40|$|For {{over four}} decades, now, mushtikas and its common associate, the {{triangular}} terracotta cakes have been {{believed to be}} part of ‘fire altars’. This is, {{in spite of the fact}} that, either or both of these have been found from hearths, ovens, <b>kilns,</b> as <b>flooring</b> material, on walls, in passages, streets, bathrooms and therefore obviously near commodes. Further, the great variety of central stele and construction material, size and shape, materials found within ‘fire altars’ suggest that, all the above were devoid of religious symbolism and used to achieve domestic or industrial objectives. The cakes being primarily associated with run of the mill economic activities ended up in diverse and defiling contexts. However, like many cultures across time and space Harappans may also have used the medium of fire for offering sacrifices. Therefore the existence of ‘fire altars’ is not denied as such, but these then should not have the ubiquitous cakes, at the least...|$|R
50|$|The green hops {{were spread}} out in the <b>kilns.</b> The <b>floors</b> were {{generally}} of 1+1/4 in square battens nailed at right angles across the joists, placed {{so that there was}} a similar gap between each batten, and covered with a horsehair cloth.

50|$|Six brick built kilns were {{identified}} {{during the course}} of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, {{were identified}} with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the <b>kilns</b> were cobbled <b>floors,</b> which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits - to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits.|$|R
500|$|Altrincham Fair became St James's Fair or Samjam in 1319 and {{continued}} until 1895. Fair days {{had their own}} court of Pye Powder (a corruption of the French for [...] "dusty feet"), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes arising from the day's dealings. By 1348 the town had 120burgage plots– ownership of land used {{as a measure of}} status and importance in an area– putting it {{on a par with the}} Cheshire town of Macclesfield and above Stockport and Knutsford. The earliest known residence in Altrincham was [...] "the Knoll", on Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. An 1983 excavation on the demolished building, made by South Trafford Archaeological Group, discovered evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may have contained a drying <b>kiln</b> or malting <b>floor.</b> During the English Civil War, men from Altrincham fought for the Parliamentarian Sir George Booth. During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.|$|R
