50|$|The {{first five}} {{locomotives}} were delivered {{with the first}} Type TJ tenders, which had a 6 lt t coal and 3500 imp gal water capacity. They were put to work between Estcourt and Charlestown on the Transvaal border, where they regularly hauled loads of 225 lt t, as well as <b>fast</b> perishable <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> They proved to be highly successful in use, which led to an order for another 25 locomotives from NBL in 1910. These were delivered in 1911 and numbered {{in the range from}} 345 to 369 on the NGR roster. They were identical to the first batch of engines in all respects, except that they had Type TM tenders, which had an 8 lt 5 lcwt t coal and 4000 imp gal water capacity.|$|R
50|$|It was {{determined}} that the volume of <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was insufficient to warrant retention of facilities at Kopuaranga, and with alternatives available at Opaki and Mauriceville, closure to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was recommended. The Department consulted with the local branch of Federated Farmers in April 1966 who were agreeable to the proposal. Kopuaranga was consequently closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in wagon lots from 1 August 1966.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{important}} with a flour mill, and china clay and stone traffic, and a tarmacadam plant. The china clay works near the station closed in 2008/09. Public <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased on 1 June 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{significant}} with a banana packing factory (operated by Geest, and served by trains from Southampton and Avonmouth docks), and Air Ministry and Royal Engineers depots were rail served. Ordinary <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was withdrawn in 1973.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} open to {{passengers}} on 20 August 1856 and to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on 1 January 1857. The station closed in 1952 but passenger services on the line continued until 4 July 1966 and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> continued until 1981.|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} World War I (1914-1918) {{resulted}} in a huge upsurge in <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> at Carlisle, and the dispersed goods depots of the individual companies resulted in heavy traffic in trip workings between them.

50|$|The station saw mainly {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was fairly}} light, particularly {{as there was}} no resident coal merchant. Nevertheless, from the early 1960s a local manufacturer of three-wheel invalid cars began regularly sending his goods by rail. However, the decision was taken in 1963 to close the engineers' depot and, in 1965, to concentrate <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on Exeter. At the same time, the Broad Clyst station itself was put forward for closure {{as part of the}} package of economies proposed by the Beeching Report. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased in 1965, with passenger traffic ending the following year.|$|R

50|$|Much more {{important}} for the small line was <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> After all even before 1914 Alling had a filter cloth and paper factory as well as a sawmill.

50|$|After the {{anticipated}} {{use of the}} route for trans-regional <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{did not come to}} fruition, it was used mainly by local customers. From the north these mainly ran to Gangkofen, trains heading south departed from stations between the hub at Mühldorf to Frontenhausen-Marklkofen. Mixed trains were uncommon.

50|$|Passenger {{traffic on}} the entire line was {{suspended}} on 26 May 1974 and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ended between Goldmühl and Bischofsgrün on 31 May 1986.

50|$|The general <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{had also}} {{declined}} steeply, and after 5 April 1965 <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{on the line}} was discontinued; the branch was shortened back to Green Grove; from that time the milk tanker traffic was the only traffic using the line. It too ceased on 1 October 1973 and from that time the line was completely closed.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a gradual}} decline in {{passenger}} {{traffic in the}} 1950s {{as well as a}} decline in <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> In 1955/6 Adelaide Lead railway station was closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> and reduced in status to a rail motor stopping place.
