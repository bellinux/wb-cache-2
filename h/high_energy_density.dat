5|$|Lithium {{vanadium}} oxide {{has been proposed}} {{for use as a}} <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> anode for lithium ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. Vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the Lithium Vanadium Phosphate Battery, another type of lithium ion battery.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both have a very <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing {{the size of the}} weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E

25|$|Due to its <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> {{and ease}} of handling, oil has a unique role as a {{transportation}} fuel. There are, however, {{a number of possible}} alternatives. Among the biofuels the use of bioethanol and biodiesel is already established to some extent in some countries.|$|E
25|$|Due to its <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> easy {{transportability}} {{and relative}} abundance, oil {{has become the}} world's most important source of energy since the mid-1950s. Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and plastics; the 16 percent not used for energy production is converted into these other materials.|$|E
25|$|These non-rechargeable {{batteries}} {{have many}} advantages over {{other forms of}} lithium battery such as a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> a wide operational temperature range and long storage and operational lifespans. However, their high cost and safety concerns have limited their use.

25|$|Although {{molecular}} hydrogen has very <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> on a mass basis, {{partly because of}} its low molecular weight, as a gas at ambient conditions it has very low energy density by volume. If {{it is to be}} used as fuel stored on board the vehicle, pure hydrogen gas must be stored in an energy-dense form to provide sufficient driving range.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{developed}} as an electrical energy storage medium. Hydrogen is produced, then compressed or liquefied, cryogenicly stored at −252.882°C, and then converted back to electrical energy or heat.

25|$|Oil became {{increasingly}} {{important to the}} United States, and, from the early 1940s, the U.S. government and oil industry entered into a mutually beneficial collaboration to control global oil resources. By 1950, oil consumption exceeded that of coal. The abundance of oil in California, Texas, Oklahoma, {{as well as in}} Canada and Mexico, coupled with its low cost, ease of transportation, <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> and use in internal combustion engines, lead to its increasing use.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007 {{biochemical}} engineers {{from the}} Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced {{a method of}} producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water. In 2009, they demonstrated to produce nearly 12 moles of hydrogen per glucose unit from cellulosic materials and water. Thanks to complete conversion and modest reaction conditions, they propose to use carbohydrate as a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> hydrogen carrier with a density of 14.8 wt%.|$|E
25|$|Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold {{hydrogen}} (20.3 K {{and slightly}} above) {{in order to}} reach a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b> However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.|$|E
25|$|An {{accounting}} of the energy utilized during a thermodynamic process, known as an energy balance, {{can be applied to}} automotive fuels. With today's technology, the manufacture of hydrogen via steam reforming can be accomplished with a thermal efficiency of 75 to 80percent. Additional energy will be required to liquefy or compress the hydrogen, and to transport it to the filling station via truck or pipeline. The energy that must be utilized per kilogram to produce, transport and deliver hydrogen (i.e., its well-to-tank energy use) is approximately 50MJ using technology available in 2004. Subtracting this energy from the enthalpy of one kilogram of hydrogen, which is 141MJ, and dividing by the enthalpy, yields a thermal energy efficiency of roughly 60%. Gasoline, by comparison, requires less energy input, per gallon, at the refinery, and comparatively little energy is required to transport it and store it owing to its <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> per gallon at ambient temperatures. Well-to-tank, the supply chain for gasoline is roughly 80% efficient (Wang, 2002). Another grid-based method of supplying hydrogen would be to use electrical to run electrolysers. Roughly 6% of electricity is lost during transmission along power lines, and the process of converting the fossil fuel to electricity in the first place is roughly 33 percent efficient. Thus if efficiency is the key determinant it would be unlikely hydrogen vehicles would be fueled by such a method, and indeed viewed this way, electric vehicles would appear to be a better choice. However, as noted above, hydrogen can be produced from a number of feedstocks, in centralized or distributed fashion, and these afford more efficient pathways to produce and distribute the fuel.|$|E
25|$|Liquid oxygen {{is already}} {{used as an}} oxidant in rockets, {{and it has been}} speculated that red oxygen could make an even better oxidant, because of its <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b>|$|R

30|$|A {{significant}} increase in the <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of rechargeable batteries is required to satisfy the demands of vehicular applications and energy storage systems. One approach to solving this problem is the introduction of a new battery system having a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b> Li/air batteries are potential candidates for advanced energy storage systems because of their high storage capability [1 – 3]. They do not store a 'cathode' in the system, which allows for a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> than any other commercial rechargeable batteries. Instead, oxygen from the environment is reduced by a catalytic surface inside the air electrode. Thus, catalysts are key materials that affect the capacity, cycle life, and rate capability of such batteries.|$|R
500|$|There {{are some}} {{theoretical}} indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible. If {{they could be}} synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> {{that could be used}} as powerful propellants or explosives. This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (bond energy 946kJ⋅mol−1) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418kJ⋅mol−1) or the N–N single bond (160kJ⋅mol−1): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.) A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide (...) , pentazenium (...) , and pentazolide (cyclic aromatic [...] ). Under extremely high pressures (1.1millionatm) and high temperatures (2000K), as produced in a diamond anvil cell, nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure. This structure {{is similar to that of}} diamond, and both have extremely strong covalent bonds, resulting in its nickname [...] "nitrogen diamond".|$|E
