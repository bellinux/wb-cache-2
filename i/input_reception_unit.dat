40|$|Recently, {{the needs}} of {{underwater}} robot used for many kinds of underwater work become higher and higher. In order to control the motion of underwater robot automatically, it is an indispensable to measure its position correctly in real time. Conventional systems are based on time difference or phase lag. However, they must use expensive components, such as transponders or atomic clock, and its system becomes complex. Additionally they {{require a lot of}} signal-processing time, so they cannot be used for motion control. As a result, there exist no system which can be used for automatic motion control of underwater robot. Since 2008, we have proposed a new positioning system based on sound propagation loss and sensor network. In this system, we set many buoys that install sound <b>reception</b> <b>unit,</b> GPS receiving equipment and sensor network system on the surface of water. We use sound propagation loss to calculate the distance between robot and buoys, and with combining distance and position data for each buoy, we estimate robot position. In former study, we found that we can get higher SN ratio of signal to measure distance with using the sound of multiple frequency, we proposed a new distance measurement method M_SPL. It was introduced on the paper of “Underwater Acoustics Positioning System Based on Propagation Loss and Sensor Network” (OCEANS 2012 KOREA). In this paper, we introduce the design and construction of prototype system for this positioning system as the results of latest study. It contains transmission <b>unit,</b> <b>reception</b> <b>unit</b> and center unit. Transmission unit follows with principle of M_SPL, is set into underwater robot used as sound source. We also complete <b>reception</b> <b>unit</b> to be used to receive sound signal and calculate distance automatically. Finally, center unit receive distance and each buoy position data what are sent from <b>reception</b> <b>unit,</b> position can be calculated by using these data. We confirmed the performance of transmission unit and r- ceiving unit in water-tank, and it showed that both units can be used effectively.

40|$|Abstract:- A very known {{method to}} {{transmit}} any signal by optical fiber is the IM-FM (Intensity Modulation-Frequency Modulation) subcarrier modulation. This {{is used in}} our work to transmit the electrical signal generated by wideband-low Mhz range ultrasonic transducers, which are used in NDT (Non Destructive Testing) systems. Usually, these systems are designed to control huge structures, so they take use of several receiving transducers, that are located far apart. Traditionally, transmission of such signals from the receiving transducer to the <b>reception</b> <b>unit</b> is performed using copper cables. For some applications (i. e. continuous monitoring of nuclear plants) metallic cables are not suitable because of their high sensitivity to electromagnetic perturbations. Moreover, the multiplexing is made electronically. When {{the distance between the}} transducers and the <b>reception</b> <b>unit</b> is high and/or electromagnetic noise is important, signal worsening appears. The proposed system implements the transmission and multiplexing of such signals using optical fiber. Optical fiber is made of dielectric materials (silica or plastic) so they are inherently passive to electromagnetic noise. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is utilized to adding channels in the system by means of fiber optic WDM couplers and different light sources. The wavelengths of the optical signals utilized are located far apart inside the optical spectrum in order to avoid serious crosstalk in transmission. The limits of the number of multiplexed channels depends on the selected optical fiber, light sources spectrum and the wavelength division multiplexers or couplers utilized...|$|R

40|$|Bio medical signal {{monitoring}} systems have drawn great attention now {{a day by}} the results yielded from weighty advances in electronics and communications and field of information technologies. As an example EEG (electroencephalogram) {{is the most popular}} interface for measuring bio-potential in brain computer interface (BCI) systems which is a prominent topic organizing a direct communication link between human brain and a computer. We know that most BCI (brain computer interface) systems are bulky and hard wired EEG experiments which are inconvenient and troublesome for patients to follow their regular routine tasks. So, to overcome this problem we are going to develop a single channel wireless EEG (electroencephalogram) acquisition and recording system which will be more comfortable and convenient to the patients. The system consists of an EEG signal acquisition and processing units along with the wireless transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>units.</b> The former (analogue processing unit) includes electrodes, pre-amplifiers, filters and gain amplifiers while the later (digital processing unit) includes ADC (analogue to digital converter) and micro-controller which are used to convert the analogue EEG signals into digital signals and fulfill the digital filtering. The transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>units</b> include a Bluetooth communication module which sends the digital signals to the PC (personal computer) to be displayed over the GUI (graphical user interface). Thus the patient's EEG signal could be observed and stored without any bulky wired environment due to which the distortion caused by the long distance transmission could be reduced significantly. The key performances are: a) Long range communications (50 meters) b) ADC sampling rate is high (400 samples/sec) c) Low power consumption. d) Portable and e) Battery operated. Medical research applications based on wireless EEG acquisition system can be explored such as brain controlled games and diagnosis of diseases...|$|R
