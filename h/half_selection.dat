Thus it seems necessary to maintain the interelement spacing no less than one half wavelength when the hard selection method is desired.

40|$|Darwin’s {{theory of}} {{evolution}} through natural selection has been a cornerstone of biology {{for over a century}} and a <b>half.</b> Natural <b>selection</b> acts on phenotypes that are a result of molecular activities at the level of cells; the molecular activities themselves are encoded in the DNA sequence, or genotype. 1 Every cell is a computing machine, sensing its environment and producing appropriate responses. Abstractly, cellular activity can be viewed as computing a function; the input is an “internal representation ” of the environment using proteins and other molecules, and the output is the activation or repression of proteins expression. Yet, a quantitative theory of the complexity of such functions that could arise through Darwinian mechanisms has remained virtually unexplored. Here, complexity is viewed through the lens of theoretical computer science, e. g., the size of the circuit required to compute the function (cf. Arora and Barak [2009], Papadimitriou [2003]). To address this question, Valiant [2009] introduced a computational model of evolution. 2 In this model, an organism is an entity that computes a function of its environment. For simplicity, each organism computes only one function, though in reality there may be thousands if not more. For example, consider an enzyme that metabolizes sugars. The corresponding function computed by the cell could determine how much of this enzyme to produce, as function of the concentrations of various sugar molecules present in the environment. There is a (possibly hypothetical) ideal function indicating the best behavior in every possibl...|$|R

The effectiveness of silicone gel in scar prevention {{may influence the}} surgeons and patients regarding its routine use during the postoperative period. Aims and Objectives: To study the efficacy of silicone gel in prevention of hypertrophic scars at donor site of skin grafting. Design: Prospective randomized placebo controlled double blind study. Setting: The {{study was conducted in}} the department of Plastic Surgery, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India from June 2007 to June 2009. Patients were recruited during follow-up in the OPD. Materials and Methods: The susceptibility to scar development varied among patients; therefore, donor site scars were divided into upper half and lower half. Two types of coded gel prepared by an independent pharmacist were used on either <b>half.</b> Thus, <b>selection</b> and assessment biases and confounders were eliminated. Results: 100 scars in 50 patients were randomized into two arms, 50 control and 50 silicone gel. The median age was 25. 5 years and there were 30 men (60 %) and 20 women (40 %). Thirty-seven patients (74 %) had good compliance. The overall incidence of donor site hypertrophic scar was 94 % (47 out of 50). At the second month postoperatively, the silicone gel scars were scored lower when compared with the control scars. The differences were statistically significant in all parameters, including pigmentation (P = 0. 001), Vascularity (P = 0. 010), pliability (P = 0. 001), and height (P = 0. 010). Conclusion: The effect of silicone gel in prevention of hypertrophic scar development in donor site scars is promising. Success of silicone gel in its prophylactic role will create its routine use in all types of surgery to minimize the formation of hypertrophic scars in the early postoperative period...|$|R
