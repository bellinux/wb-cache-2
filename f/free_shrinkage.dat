Consequently, it is rather interesting to perform restrained shrinkage tests, such as the ring test according to a provisional standard developed by AASHTO. The testing procedure involves concrete ring specimens restrained by an inner steel ring on which strain gauges are placed to determine the age of cracking, since abrupt changes in the steel strain occur when concrete is cracked.

This paper highlights recent findings illustrating the influence of the test procedure, the S/V ratio exposed to drying, the geometry of specimen, and the boundary conditions. A series of experimental results are presented from <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> on ring test specimens to illustrate that the test procedure can significantly influence the measured <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> A second series of experimental results are presented from specimens with different geometries and S/V ratio exposed to drying to illustrate that drying shrinkage is dependent on both the specimen geometry and the surface exposed to drying.

40|$|Early-age {{cracking}} {{has been}} found to occur in some concrete bridge decks, slabs, and pavements when the volumetric changes associated with drying, hydration, and temperature reduction are prevented. While <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> tests can quantify length change, they may not always be sufficient for detecting materials that are prone to cracking since the potential for cracking is influenced by complex interactions of strength gain, stiffness development, creep, shrinkage, the degree of restraint, and toughness. The simplicity of the ring test enables it {{to be used as a}} comparative test to screen potential mixture designs. Based on the use of this test, AASHTO developed a provisional standard ring test which establishes specimen geometry, however the provisional standard does not provide an approach for quantifying stress development or indicating how close a specimen may be to failure.

Such gradients may produce irreversible and evolutive cracks through concrete elements.

The percentage of steel fiber volume fractions used in the mixes was 0. 25, 0. 75 and 1. 25. The amount of SRA used in the mixes was 0. 75 %, 1. 5 % and 3 % by weight of cement.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the novel test techniques that {{were developed to}} measure the parameters associated with the plastic shrinkage, and subsequent possible plastic shrinkage cracking, of high strength concrete. The parameters measured during the first 24 hours after placing were the stress- strain relationship, negative pore pressure and <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> strain development. The plastic behaviour of eight high strength concrete mixes was quantified and these mixes were then tested to assess their propensity towards plastic shrinkage cracking, using restrained ring tests. A review of the parameters associated with plastic shrinkage cracking was carried out. The general view was that as the particle size in a cement matrix gets smaller, then the negative pore pressures developed are greater and hence shrinkage increases. This meant {{that the presence of}} secondary cementing materials, of very small diameter, such as microsilica, in high strength concretes would explain their apparent susceptibility to plastic shrinkage cracking. Eight high strength concrete mixes were tested in exposed and sealed conditions. It was found that when tested in sealed conditions none of the parameters measured presented itself as the sole driving force behind plastic shrinkage or plastic shrinkage cracking. Also, when cured in sealed conditions, none of the mixes tested in the restrained ring test apparatus cracked. When tested in exposed conditions, the presence of wind had little effect on the stress-strain relationship of the mixes tested. However the presence of wind seemed to cause negative pore pressures to develop earlier than in the sealed samples and increased <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> by 3 to 40 times depending on the mix. The samples that exhibited the highest <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> strains, in exposed conditions, were the mixes that cracked when tested in the restrained shrinkage rings. The mixes that cracked all contained microsilica and these mixes did not crack when the same mixes were tested without microsilica. Polypropylene fibres were found to reduce the cracked area of the samples that cracked.

40|$|High-performance {{concrete}} (HPC) overlays {{have been}} used increasingly as an effective and economical method for bridge decks in Iowa and other states. However, due to its high cementitious material content, HPC often displays high shrinkage cracking potential. This study investigated the shrinkage behavior and cracking potential of the HPC overlay mixes commonly used in Iowa. In the study, 11 HPC overlay mixes were studied. These mixes consisted of three types of cements (Type I, I/II, and IP) and various supplementary cementitious materials (Class C fly ash, slag and metakaolin). Limestone with two different gradations was used as coarse aggregates in 10 mixes and quartzite was used in one mix. Chemical <b>shrinkage</b> of pastes, <b>free</b> drying <b>shrinkage,</b> autogenous shrinkage of mortar and concrete, and restrained ring shrinkage of concrete were monitored over time. Mechanical properties (such as elastic modulus and compressive and splitting tensile strength) of these concrete mixes were measured at different ages. Creep coefficients of these concrete mixes were estimated using the RILEM B 3 and NCHRP Report 496 models. Cracking potential of the concrete mixes was assessed based on both ASTM C 1581 and simple stress-to-strength ratio methods. The results indicate that among the 11 mixes studied, three mixes (4, 5, and 6) cracked {{at the age of}} 15, 11, and 17 days, respectively. Autogenous shrinkage of the HPC mixes ranges from 150 to 250 microstrain and <b>free</b> dying <b>shrinkage</b> of the concrete ranges from 700 to 1, 200 microstrain at 56 days. Different concrete materials (cementitious type and admixtures) and mix proportions (cementitious material content) affect concrete shrinkage in different ways. Not all mixes having a high shrinkage value cracked first. The stresses in the concrete are associated primarily with the concrete shrinkage, elastic modulus, tensile strength, and creep. However, a good relationship is found between cementitious material content and total (autogenous and <b>free</b> drying) <b>shrinkage</b> of concrete...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on setting the behavior and shrinkage properties of high-performance pavement concrete and the effect factors, such as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), chemical admixtures, and temperature. The thesis consists of two papers: (1) the relation between setting behavior and the maturity of pavement concrete materials and (2) a simple statistical model to predict the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete containing supplementary cementitious materials. In paper 1, setting behaviour and maturity of six different concrete mixtures under three different curing temperatures (18. 3, 23. 9, and 29. 4 C, corresponding to 65, 75 and 85 oF) were investigated. The mixtures were made with two different retarders (ASTM Types B and D) and with 0 or 20 % Class C fly ash replacement for Type I cement. The initial and final set times of these mixtures were measured by the penetration resistance method according to ASTM C 403. The temperature rise of the mixtures was monitored using a thermal couple, and the concrete maturity was then computed based on the time- temperature factor (TTF). A new approach is introduced for predicting concrete set time (penetration resistance) based on the concrete maturity (time-temperature factor). The results indicate that concrete penetration resistance well correlates with maturity measurements. This relationship enables engineers to assess setting behaviour of field concrete on site. In paper 2, autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>free</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> of nine different high performance concrete mixtures used for bridge decks and bridge overlays constructions were measured, and the total shrinkage (defined as autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> plus <b>free</b> drying <b>shrinkage)</b> was studied. The mixtures were systemically designed for evaluating effects of class C fly ash and ground granulated blast-furance slag replacement on shrinkage proporties. A simplified exponential model ɛauto/drying(t) =a+b*e(c*t) was introduced for describing and predicting shrinkage in high-performance concrete when different types and amounts of supplementary cementitious materials were used. This model fits for both autogenous and <b>free</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> and is validated and proved by comparing measured value with predicted shrinkage value of an independent group of mixtures. The results indicate that compare to GGBF slag, fly ash performs much better to reduce the total <b>shrinkage.</b> Additionally, <b>free</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> increases linearly with autogenous shrinkage between 0 and 14 days. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the concrete maturity method successfully describes the concrete setting behavior; and the exponential model successfully predicts the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete with SCMs. Additionally, the results indicate Class C fly ash replacement can reduce the total shrinkage and extend the setting time of high-performance concrete.

40|$|Concrete {{elements}} are always {{subjected to a}} certain degree of restraint caused by internal reinforcement, connected elements, external boundaries, or a combination thereof. The degree of restraint provided may affect considerably how concrete shrinkage cracks develop, thus affecting structural behaviour. The effect of restraint is complex to quantify and still poorly understood. This paper introduces a methodology to simulate and quantify more accurately real life restraining factors for structures. To achieve this, an experimental programme was undertaken to examine the free and restrained shrinkage of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC). The performance of seven SFRC mixes using various dosages of Recycled Tyre Steel Fibres (RTSF) and Manufactured Undulated Steel Fibres (MUND) is examined. The drying shrinkage was monitored over a period of ten months. The results show that shrinkage strains were very similar in terms of free and restrained shrinkage, whilst the plain concrete exhibited the lowest strains. The variation in shrinkage strain seems to be mostly related to the initial water content and volume of entrained air voids. Specimens subjected to restrained shrinkage showed about half the strain measured on <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> specimens. <b>Free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> tests showed that the resulting strains were lower than the values predicted by fib MC 2010 and EC 2004, possibly due to the use of GGBS as cement replacement.

These HPC mixes usually consist of high amounts of cementitious materials and tend to have high tendency towards cracking induced by shrinkage. Accelerated corrosion of reinforcing steel and deterioration of deck surface are potential threats in bridge decks where cracks have occured. Cracking potential of a mix under restraint is currently evaluated by ASTM C 1581. The method looks into {{the rate at which the}} strain develops in a restrained condition to evaluate cracking potential. But a mix that develops shrinkage at a high rate may also develop strength at a higher rate, compensating the potential to cracking. This study involves investigating the use of simpler shrinkage measurements and strength characteristics to determine the cracking potential of a concrete mix. For this investigation 11 HPC mixtures selected by the Iowa DOT which were composed of 3 cements, Type I, I/II and IP. Supplementary cementitious materials class c fly ash, slag and metakaolin were replaced by 20 %, 15 % and 5. 6 % respectively. Limestone coarse aggregate was used in 10 mixes and 1 mix with quartzite. Two gradations of coarse aggregate were used for limestone aggregates. The HPC mixes were investigated for free drying, restrained ring, elastic modulus, compressive and split tensile strength for a duration of 28 days. Average creep coefficient was calculated using the B- 3 and AASHTO Report 496 (2009) models. Restrained shrinkage and elastic modulus measured was used to calculate induced stress in full restraint which was then adjusted for creep.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis involves the study of drying shrinkage behavior of mortars and field concrete mixtures made with ternary cementitious blends. The thesis is composed of two papers resulting from the study: (1) Short-Term Drying Shrinkage of Ternary Blends and (2) Drying Shrinkage of Ternary Blends for Use in Transportation Structure. In the former, statistical response surface analysis was employed to develop shrinkage models {{to better understand the}} drying shrinkage behavior of mortar mixes made with ternary blends. In the latter, ternary blend concrete mixtures used for pavement and bridge deck structures in different states were selected. Factors affecting drying shrinkage behavior of these ternary blend concretes were also investigated. In Paper 1, shrinkage behavior of mortar mixes made with various ternary blends was studied. Ternary blends consisting of different combinations of portland or blended cement, slag cement, fly ash (Class C and F) and/or silica fume were considered: the amounts of slag cement, fly ash and silica fume ranged between 15 - 35 %, 13 - 30 %, and 3 - 10 % by mass of cementitious, respectively. Mortar bars were made with the ternary blends and subjected to a drying condition (i. e., T = 73 y 3 yF and RH = 50 y 4 %) after standard curing for 28 days. <b>Free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the mortar bars was measured up to 28 days. Based on the test results, a response surface analysis was done {{to examine the effects of}} blend proportions on shrinkage behavior of the mortars and a statistical model was developed for predicting the mortar shrinkage behavior. Furthermore, to validate the models, shrinkage strains of an independent group of mortar mixes were measured, and the measured values were compared with the predicted values. The results indicated that among the three supplementary cementitious materials in the ternary blends studied, slag cement showed a dominant effect on mortar shrinkage. The contribution of Class C fly ash to the mortar <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was slightly less than that of slag cement. Increasing silica fume content slightly increased <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> while an increase in Class F fly ash content slightly decreased <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the mortar. There was a good correlation between the measured shrinkage strain and the strain predicted from the shrinkage model developed from the response surface analysis. The work discussed in Paper 2 investigated the drying shrinkage behavior of ternary blend concretes that were used in transportation structures. Factors affecting drying shrinkage behavior of ternary blend concretes were studied. Five concrete mixes, used for either pavement or bridge deck construction, were tested for both restrained and unrestrained shrinkages. The effects of blend materials and mix proportion on the concrete shrinkages were assessed. The results indicated that shrinkage strain rate linearly increased with clay content of fine aggregate, cementitious material content, paste-to-void ratio (by volume), and dosage of water reducer of the concrete mixes. The study demonstrates that the supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) can be used to develop a statistical model in order to quantitatively predict drying shrinkage strain. The study gives a better understanding on how SCMs affect mortar and concrete drying shrinkage behavior.

The results showed that using GWG microparticles up to maximum replacement of 15  % produces concrete with improved hardened strengths.

30|$|Drying {{shrinkage}} can {{be defined}} as the volumetric change due to the drying of concrete. This change in volume of the concrete is not equal to volume of the water lost. The loss of free water occurs first; this causes little to no shrinkage. As the drying of the concrete continues, the adsorbed water held by hydrostatic tension in the small capillaries (< 50  nm) is removed. The shrinkage due to this water loss is significantly larger than that associated with the loss of free water. The loss of water produces tensile stresses, which lead the concrete to shrink (Guneyisi et al. 2010). <b>Free</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> of the SCCs specimens after drying was assessed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 91  days.

Nitrogen sorption experiments show that xerogels with the same overall extent of shrinkage can have vastly different microstructures due to the effects of microphase separation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the influence of the C-factor and the mode of polymerization on the cohesive strength of various dual-cure resin cements. Methods Three curing conditions were tested; chemical curing with <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> conditions (C = 0), and constraint shrinkage conditions (C = 25), and dual-curing with <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> conditions (C = 0). Opaque polyethylene, brass (pretreated with Clearfil SE bond), and transparent polyethylene tubes respectively, were filled with the different cements. The tubes were 20 mm long with an inner diameter of 1. 6 or 1. 8 mm. Five cements, DC Core Automix, Panavia F 2. 0, Maxcem, Multilink, and RelyX Unicem, were tested with ten specimens per group. The specimens were trimmed to an hour-glass shape with a neck diameter of 1 mm, stored in water (37 °C, 24 h), and subjected to microtensile testing (1 mm min− 1). SEM analysis was carried out on chemically cured samples of DC Core Automix C = 0 and C = 25. Data were statistically analyzed (Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, p < 0. 05). Results Most cements showed no significant differences between the curing modes. A high C-factor negatively influences the cohesive strength of some cements. SEM analysis shows that chemical curing of DC Core Automix in a high C-factor environment leads to more and larger microvoids in the cement. Significance Constraint shrinkage conditions, i. e. a high C-factor, can negatively influence the physical properties of a dual-cured resin cement, which would clinically be the case in the confined space of a root canal or post space preparation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{recycled}} aggregates in mortar and concrete induces a large shrinkage {{due to the}} capacity of these aggregates to absorb a great quantity of water. The influence of polypropylene and metallic fibres (Fibraflex) has been studied in different proportioning to reduce shrinkage and cracking. The efficiency of polypropylene and metallic fibres to reduce restrained shrinkage cracking is evaluated by using a ring mortar cast around a stiff steel ring. By using fibres, the crack width decreases significantly. <b>Free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> results are equally investigated. Finally, crack width in reinforced fibre mortars is calculated analytically by using the model of Grzybowski and Shah. Results are compared with experimental values. The study demonstrates that theoretical values of crack widths correspond reasonably to experimental values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Shrinkage {{cracking}} is {{the direct}} cause {{which leads to}} the deterioration of durability and integrity of concrete. In this paper, ring-test methods are used to study the early age cracking characterization of compound mineral admixtures concrete which includes steel slag, blast furnace slag and fly ash. The effect of compound admixtures on cracking characterization of concrete is discussed, restraint stress caused by concrete shrinkage and cracking age are analyzed. Through the comprehensive consideration of the <b>free</b> <b>shrinkage</b> strain, creep, restriction factors on the effect of the cracking of concrete specimens. The results show that suitable proportion mineral admixtures can be used to reduce cracking in concrete. The risk of cracking can be estimated for compound admixtures concrete, so that it will improve the durability of concrete structures...|$|E
40|$|Different {{types of}} fibres {{are often used}} in {{concrete}} to prevent microcracking due to shrinkage, and polypropylene fibres {{are among the most}} often used ones. If not prevented, microcracks can lead to the development of larger cracks as drying shrinkage occurs, enabling penetration of aggressive substances from the environment and reducing durability of concrete structures. The hypothesis of the present research is that polypropylene fibres, used in concrete for controlling formation of microcracks due to shrinkage, can be replaced with recycled polymer fibres obtained from end-of-life tyres. To test the hypothesis, concrete mixtures containing polypropylene fibres and recycled tyre polymer fibres were prepared and tested. Experimental programme focused on autogenous, <b>free,</b> and restrained <b>shrinkage.</b> It was shown that PP fibres can be substituted with higher amount of recycled tyre polymer fibres obtaining concrete with similar shrinkage behaviour. The results indicate promising possibilities of using recycled tyre polymer fibres in concrete products. At the same time, such applications would contribute to solving the problem of waste tyre disposal...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gypsum in slag-blended cement on <b>free</b> and {{restrained}} <b>shrinkage</b> of concrete subjected to various curing conditions {{is presented in}} this paper. Added gypsum in slag-blended cements was found to increase the autogenous shrinkage of concrete up to 56 days. However, added gypsum caused small reduction in the long-term shrinkage when the concrete was exposed to drying. Slag concretes with 3 % added gypsum content, when exposed to drying {{at the age of}} 24 h, exhibited more cracking tendency than comparable concrete with 0 % added gypsum. This is attributed to the increased shrinkage evolution of slag concrete with 3 % gypsum content at early ages. However, if moist cured for 7 days, increasing the amount of gypsum from 3 to 5 % in slag-blended cement reduced the cracking tendency. It is concluded that the beneficial effect of increasing gypsum in reducing cracking tendency in slag concrete is only favourable if moist cured for 7 days...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{solidification}} {{of metals}} {{continues to be}} a phenomenon of great interest to physicists, metallurgists, casting engineers and software developers. It directly affects the production cycle time, internal quality of castings and material utilization (yield). The process of casting solidification is complex in nature and the simulation of such process is required in industry before it is actually undertaken. The volumetric contraction accompanying solidification of molten metal manifests in defects like shrinkage cavity, porosity, and sink. These defects can be minimized by an intelligent methoding and simulation using casting software. In this paper, an attempt has been made to redesign and develop a casting free from defects, in particular, shrinkage defect. The component taken for methoding and simulation study was subjected to high amount of shrinkage defects which was the major cause for the rejection in the foundry. It also was having very low yield as 45 % as per the foundry information. The component under study consists of square shaped (at top) plate having three perforations with diminishing height (at bottom) and subjected to multiple hot spot. Therefore, optimum location of feeder has been identified by carrying out various simulation trials. Proper feeding aids have helped in getting the hot spot completely shifted inside the feeder. Simulation based approach has helped in the improvement of the feedability index which represents yield of feeders and quality of casting (percentage of volume <b>free</b> from <b>shrinkage</b> porosity). The simulations results were compared with the experimental trial and the comparison was found to be in good agreement...|$|R
