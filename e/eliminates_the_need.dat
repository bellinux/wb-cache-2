This also <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. This option also delays or <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for more professional and costly levels of care. Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.|$|E
5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
