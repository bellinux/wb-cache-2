5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (<b>graben),</b> and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent <b>graben</b> formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15–50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1–2km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest <b>graben</b> have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal faults, a system of narrow, parallel <b>grabens</b> cut across {{large parts of the}} volcano. The <b>grabens</b> strike to the northeast and range in width from 0.5 to 2.8 km. Chains of pits craters associated with the <b>grabens</b> are also observed. The age relationship between the <b>grabens</b> and normal faults is complex. In places, the <b>grabens</b> appear to crosscut the normal faults, indicating that the <b>grabens</b> are younger. However, the strikes of the normal faults locally appear to have a strong northeast influence, suggesting that the stresses that formed the <b>grabens</b> predate the normal faults. It is likely that the <b>grabens</b> developed repeatedly {{over an extended period of}} time and may be partly contemporaneous with the normal faults.|$|R
50|$|Several {{pull-apart}} structural <b>grabens</b> {{formed at}} flexures in the orogenic belt, forming the Levenger and Moorilyanna <b>Grabens.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Late Mesozoic, the {{thinning}} {{of the eastern}} Eurasia produced extensional features such as high-angle faults, rifts, <b>grabens,</b> drag-folds and exposed the metamorphic basement core. The high-angle normal faults are associated with <b>grabens</b> formation.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale <b>graben</b> resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be <b>graben</b> that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial <b>graben,</b> or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the {{drainage}} area of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a <b>graben</b> region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.|$|E
40|$|Information from lunar <b>grabens</b> is used {{to address}} the {{question}} of whether the <b>grabens</b> and wrinkle ridges are tectonic or volcanic in origin. The geometry of simple <b>grabens</b> is discussed, and the kinematics and mechanics are addressed in terms of an elastic response model, a brittle response model, the mechanics of the megaregolith, and total extension for all lunar <b>grabens.</b> Constraints on the thermal evolution of the moon are considered, including thermal history calculations and <b>grabens</b> in space and time. Mare basin tectonics is discussed in terms of two kinematic models/ subsidence by increased radius of curvature and subsidence with no increase in radius of curvature. It is concluded that the observable geological history of the moon is inconsistent with any significant expansion of the moon since about 3. 9 billion years ago. Both thermal and tectonic models of lunar evolution are critized...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{structure}} of the island of Mallorca consists {{of a set of}} horsts and <b>grabens</b> which are bounded by Upper Miocene-Quaternary listric normal faults. Horsts are segments of a Lower Miocene thrusted and folded belt and constitutes the Sierras. The basins developed at the <b>grabens,</b> which are filled by Upper Miocene-Quaternary sediments. Groundwater flows from the horsts to the <b>grabens.</b> At the horsts adjacent aquifers exists because of its geological structure (imbricate thrust system), whereas at the <b>grabens</b> aquifers are superposed due to the horizontal sedimentary infilling. Major springs, very important for water supply to Palma, are located at the listric normal fault...|$|R
25|$|<b>Grabens</b> are tectonic {{features}} that form under extensional stresses. Structurally, they {{are composed of}} two normal faults, with a down-dropped block between them. Most <b>grabens</b> are found within the lunar maria near the edges of large impact basins.|$|R
5|$|The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} ridges and troughs {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons. Within each band, {{which can be}} up to 25 to 70km wide, are individual ridges and troughs up to 200km long and between 10 and 35km apart. The bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the <b>graben</b> or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be <b>graben</b> formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Oberon formed from the {{accretion}} disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at {{the boundary between the}} mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which is dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of chasmata (<b>graben</b> or scarps) formed during crustal extension {{as a result of the}} expansion of its interior during its early evolution.|$|E
50|$|The field {{lies within}} the Jalisco tectonic block. Two <b>grabens</b> cut tuffs of Cretaceous {{age in the}} area and the Mascota field has {{developed}} in these <b>grabens,</b> {{with the exception of a}} group of cones farther north which probably formed on a fault.|$|R
50|$|Horsts and <b>grabens</b> {{are very}} well {{documented}} throughout this region. Although horsts and <b>grabens</b> do show and produce crustal extension, for a sufficient ocean basin to form, {{there needs to be}} extension that can accommodate for the extensive down fall of the <b>grabens.</b> Listric faults produce the correct model for this sufficient crustal extension. These faults have been documented by Chorowicz, J. 2005 and aid in further verification of the future of this region and the potential for continued extension and subsidence.|$|R
5000|$|Knowledge of the {{locations}} and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae {{is important for}} the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water. [...] Many <b>grabens</b> are found in the Arcadia quadrangle. Pictures below show examples of <b>grabens</b> in Arcadia.|$|R
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably {{strong enough to}} melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. Further melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water ('ocean') rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like <b>graben.</b> Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and <b>graben</b> faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
25|$|The entire massif {{is divided}} or nearly so by a karst {{topography}} into three sections: the Gordes Massif {{north of the}} Alasehir or Gediz <b>graben,</b> the Cine Massif south of the Büyük Menderes <b>graben</b> and the Central Massif between. The latter is split like a forked tongue by the Küçük Menderes <b>Graben</b> into the Kuzey Detachment {{to the north and}} the Guney Detachment to the south. Mycale is part of the Guney Detachment, while Latmus is in the Cine Massif.|$|E
40|$|Multichannel {{reflection}} seismic {{data were}} acquired {{south of the}} Salento peninsula, {{in an area where}} crustal seismicity has been recorded. Seismic profiles show the presence of small <b>grabens</b> bounded by extensional faults with NW-SE direction. These <b>grabens</b> are filled with Plio-Quaternary sediments and represent the prolongation of the <b>grabens</b> located onshore in the Salento peninsula. Outer arc extension due to flexuring of the Adriatic-Apulian lithosphere under the double load of the Hellenides and Apennines-Calabrian arc is thought to have originated these <b>grabens.</b> The Adriatic-Apulian continental lithosphere presents a very small radius of curvature and a decoupling between upper crust and mantle lithosphere is expected. Inner arc compression within the upper crust may be responsible for the seismicity recorded in the area...|$|R
40|$|Affected by thermal {{perturbation}} due to mantle uprising, the rheological {{structure of}} the lithosphere could be modified, {{which could lead to}} different rifting patterns from shelf to slope in a passive continental margin. From the observed deformation style on the northern South China Sea and analogue modeling experiments, we rind that the rift zone located on the shelf is characterized by half <b>grabens</b> or simple <b>grabens</b> controlled mainly by long faults with large vertical offset, supposed to be formed with normal lithosphere extension. On the slope, where the lithosphere is very hot due to mantle upwelling and heating, composite <b>grabens</b> composed of symmetric <b>grabens</b> developed. The boundary and inner faults are all short with small vertical offset. Between the zones with very hot and normal lithosphere, composite half <b>grabens</b> composed of half <b>grabens</b> or asymmetric <b>grabens</b> formed, whose boundary faults are long with large vertical offset, while the inner faults are relatively short. Along with the thickness decrease of the brittle upper crust due to high temperature, the deformation becomes more sensitive to the shape of a pre-existing weakness zone and shows orientation variation along strike. When there was a bend in the pre-existing weakness zone, and the basal plate was pulled by a clockwise rotating stress, the strongest deformation always occurs along the middle segment and at the transition area from the middle to the eastern segments, which contributes to a hotter lithosphere in the middle segment, where the Baiyun (sic) sag formed.

30|$|Another E–W {{trending}} branch rupture 2.5  km long appeared {{south of}} Kawayo (Fig.  5 a, i). This branch was {{a zone of}} sub-parallel fissures and <b>grabens</b> (Fig.  5 h, i). Although much of the natural topography had been artificially modified, some of these <b>grabens</b> appeared to coincide with preexisting small valleys.|$|R
25|$|Minor but {{significant}} igneous activity {{occurred during the}} Mesozoic era, including kimberlite emplacement during the Jurassic period, {{and the development of}} alkalic intrusions along the Ottawa-Bonnechere <b>Graben</b> and elsewhere in Ontario. This second episode of alkalic volcanism occurred along {{the eastern part of the}} <b>graben</b> in the early Cretaceous.|$|E
25|$|The Ottawa-Bonnechere <b>Graben</b> {{runs from}} the Montreal area on the east to near Sudbury and Lake Nipissing on the west. On the east, it joins the Saint Lawrence rift system, a half-graben which extends more than 1000km along the Saint Lawrence River valley and links the Ottawa and Saguenay <b>Graben.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along the {{northern}} {{side of the}} Ottawa-Bonnechere <b>Graben</b> lies a dramatic escarpment that forms {{the southern edge of}} the Gatineau Hills. This escarpment, called the Eardley Escarpment, makes this part of the <b>graben</b> an attractive location for rock climbers and hikers, offering a beautiful view of the relatively flat fields below, which extend to the Ottawa River.|$|E
25|$|Using {{gravity and}} aeromagnetic data, {{combined}} with gravity modeling, it was inferred that Proterozoic <b>grabens,</b> and half-grabens filled with strata of the Unkar Group – lie buried beneath Phanerozoic rocks in northern Arizona {{that surround the}} Grand Canyon. The <b>grabens</b> and half <b>grabens</b> filled with strata of the Unkar group are associated with northwest–southeast trending Mesoproterozoic fault systems that have curving, southwest-dipping traces. These fault systems were later reactivated during the Neoproterozoic, to form basins in which the following Chuar Group accumulated, and during the Cenozoic, to form geologic structures, i.e., faults, anticlines, synclines, and monoclines, that are exposed at the surface.|$|R
50|$|Heaven & Hell, {{situated}} {{on a large}} hill north of Narlıkuyu, consists of the <b>grabens</b> result from assoil of furrings for thousands of years. Natural phenomena of the <b>grabens</b> is named 'Hell & Heaven' because of the exotic effects on people. From an ancient path, 260 meter long mythological giant Typhon's cave can be accessible.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{important}} {{features of the}} TVZ include the Whakatane, Ngakuru and Ruapehu <b>grabens.</b>|$|R
25|$|Visible on {{the floor}} of Raditladi inside the peak ring are {{concentric}} narrow troughs, formed by extension (pulling apart) of the surface. The troughs are arranged in a circular pattern approximately 70km in diameter. They are thought to be <b>graben.</b> The geometrical center of the system of <b>graben</b> coincides with the center of Raditladi and is offset form the center of the peak ring complex.|$|E

5000|$|Friedrich Spiegelhalter, Die Tektonik im obersten Teil des Bonndorfer <b>Grabens,</b> Inaugural-Dissertation, C. Winter 1912 ...|$|R
5000|$|As in all rifting environments, <b>grabens</b> formed. Many {{of these}} <b>grabens</b> were created, {{but for some}} of them, {{extension}} stopped before full rifting occurred. Where only partial rifting occurred, basins formed. By definition, a basin is any area that collects sediments. These [...] "aborted rifts" [...] (rifts that are tectonically inactive and no longer collecting sediments) extend from Alabama to Newfoundland.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between Earth and Venus, {{it is suggested that}} they have a similar lithospheric elastic thickness of ~30 km. East African Rift is the only rift that can be compared to Devana Chasma. [...] Both rifts have fault segments length around ~100 km, which makes them stronger than any extensional system on Earth. However, they differ in their half <b>grabens,</b> East African Rifts' half <b>grabens</b> are around 50 km wide while on Venus it is around 150 km. In East African Rift, the higher elastic thickness can explain the wide half <b>grabens.</b> However, on Venus the main force is the high shear stress due to the cold lithosphere, which require the faults to be stronger in order to move. As a result, it has a wider half <b>grabens</b> than the one on Earth. Studying and comparing these two rift systems help us to understand how volcanism and tectonic activities affected the development and formation of the Beta Regio region on Venus.|$|R
