5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later <b>full-faced</b> and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, a seal {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later <b>full-faced</b> and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century. Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.|$|E

Upon the helm sits the crest, depicting the red lion, forward facing and sitting atop the Crown of Scotland, displaying the Honours of Scotland. (The lion wears the Crown of Scotland and holds both the Sceptre and the Sword of State).|$|E
25|$|During the Unified Silla period, East Asia was {{particularly}} stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was {{also influenced by}} new Tang Dynasty styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with <b>full-faced</b> Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome {{of which is the}} Seokguram Grotto.|$|E
2500|$|Bodine {{has driven}} {{for some of}} the best car owners in NASCAR, {{including}} Junior Johnson, Bud Moore and Rick Hendrick as well as owning his own cars, which he ran for several seasons after buying the assets of Alan Kulwicki's race team after his death in 1993. He has 565 starts, 37 poles, 18 wins, and nearly $16 million in winnings during his Winston Cup/Nextel Cup career. [...] He was honored as one of [...] "NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers" [...] during NASCAR's 50th anniversary celebration. [...] Bodine has always been a great innovator and brought many ideas to Winston Cup. [...] He introduced power steering and <b>full-faced</b> helmets to Winston Cup. He was also the last driver to win a race and lap the field, in the fall 1994 race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He holds the track record at Atlanta Motor Speedway from his polesitting run after the track was repaved in 1997, with a speed of over 197mph.|$|E
2500|$|Isabella and Edward II {{were finally}} married at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 25 January 1308. Isabella's {{wardrobe}} gives some indications of her wealth and style– she had gowns of baudekyn, velvet, taffeta and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and coifs; she {{brought with her}} two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen. At {{the time of her}} marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by Geoffrey of Paris as [...] "the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe." [...] This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her [...] "Isabella the Fair". Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, queen regnant of Navarre, a plump, plain woman. This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly <b>full-faced</b> women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead. Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action. Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|The rise of Islam in {{the seventh}} century had also caused some {{consideration}} of the use of holy images. Early Islamic belief stressed the impropriety of iconic representation. Earlier scholarship tried to link Byzantine Iconoclasm directly to Islam by arguing that Byzantine emperors saw the success of the early Caliphate and decided that Byzantine use of images (as opposed to Islamic aniconism) had angered God. This does not seem entirely plausible however. The use of images had probably been increasing in the years leading up to the outbreak of iconoclasm. [...] One notable change came in 695, when Justinian II put a <b>full-faced</b> image of Christ on the obverse of his gold coins. The effect on iconoclast opinion is unknown, but the change certainly caused Caliph Abd al-Malik to break permanently with his previous adoption of Byzantine coin types to start a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only. [...] This appears more like two opposed camps asserting their positions (pro and anti images) than one empire seeking to imitate the other. More striking is the fact that Islamic iconoclasm rejected any depictions of living people or animals, not only religious images. By contrast, Byzantine iconomachy concerned itself only with the question of the holy presence (or lack thereof) of images. Thus, although the rise of Islam may have created an environment in which images were at the forefront of intellectual question and debate, Islamic iconoclasm {{does not seem to have}} had a direct causal role in the development of the Byzantine image debate.|$|E

60|$|This brought Su-Su to herself. She glanced {{across at}} Keesh, who had {{unsheathed}} the Russian knife and {{was watching her}} intently. His face was firm and set, and in it she read the law. Slipping back the hood of her parka, she bared her neck and {{rose to her feet}} There she paused and took a long look about her, at the rimming forest, at the faint stars in the sky, at the camp, at the snow-shoes in the snow--a last long comprehensive look at life. A light breeze stirred her hair from the side, and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head and followed it around until she met it <b>full-faced.</b>|$|E
60|$|The eventful {{morning was}} bright, a <b>full-faced</b> sun confronting early window-gazers eastward, and all {{perceived}} (for they were practised in weather-lore) {{that there was}} permanence in the glow. Visitors soon began to flock in from county houses, villages, remote copses, and lonely uplands, the latter in oiled boots and tilt bonnets, to see the reception, or if not to see it, at any rate to be near it. There was hardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on. Solomon Longways, Christopher Coney, Buzzford, {{and the rest of}} that fraternity, showed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven o'clock pint to half-past ten; from which they found a difficulty in getting back to the proper hour for several days.|$|E
60|$|As I {{entered the}} door of the hotel, there met me a short, corpulent, round, and <b>full-faced</b> man, rather elderly, if not old. He was a little lame. He {{addressed}} me in a hearty, hospitable tone, and, judging that it must be my landlord, I delivered a letter of introduction from Pierce. Of course it was fully efficient in obtaining the best accommodations that were to be had. I found that we were expected, a man having brought the news of our intention the day before. Here ensued great inquiries after the General, and wherefore he had not come. I was looked at with considerable curiosity on my own account, especially by the ladies, of whom there were several, agreeable and pretty enough. There were four or five gentlemen, most of whom had not much that was noteworthy.|$|E
60|$|All this chatter {{is mixed}} up in my mind with an unusual sense of {{hovering}} attentive menservants, who seemed {{all of them to}} my heated imagination to be watching me (and particularly one clean-shaven, reddish-haired, <b>full-faced</b> young man) lest I looked too much at the Lady Mary Christian. Of course they were merely watching our plates and glasses, but my nerves and temper were now in such a state that if my man went off to the buffet to get Sir Godfrey the pickled walnuts, I fancied he went to report the progress of my infatuation, and if a strange face appeared with the cider cup, that this was a new observer come to mark the revelation of my behavior. My food embarrassed me. I found hidden meanings in the talk of the Roden girl and her guardsman, and an ironical discovery in Sir Godfrey's eye....|$|E

5000|$|As if {{to clarify}} the situation, English heraldist Hugh Clark wrote in his Introduction to Heraldry (1829): The true heraldic lion, {{according}} to French authors, is always to be represented in profile, or, as the ancient heralds say, showing but one eye and one ear. His attitude, also, should always be rampant or ravaging. When passant and <b>full-faced,</b> they blazoned him a leopard, vide Lion Leopardé: in England, however, the lions in the royal and other achievements have always been blazoned as lions, however depicted {{since the time of}} Henry III, in whose reign they were called [...] "Leopards".Lion Leopardé ... is a French term for what the English call a Lion passant gardant. The word leopard is always made use of by the French heralds to express in their language, a lion <b>full-faced,</b> or gardant. Thus, when a lion is placed on an escutcheon in that attitude which we call rampant gardant, the French blazon it a Lion Leopardé. When he is passant only, they call him leopard lioné.|$|E

Gilbert, known for wearing a <b>full-faced</b> crash helmet, was the driver of an equally power-hungry De Tomaso Pantera. Gilbert's car is black with white stripes and a number 66 on the hood and the sides. His dominance in the race seemed similar to that of von Stickle, until he crashed in the later stages.|$|E
