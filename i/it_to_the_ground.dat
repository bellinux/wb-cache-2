5|$|In the Revolt of 1173–74 by Henry II's sons {{against their}} father, the king gave de Broc custody of Haughley Castle. On 13 October 1173, Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, {{captured}} the castle for the rebels and burned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt failed, and Mehmed {{marched to the}} Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered an additional 20,000 impaled Turks. The Sultan and his troops then sailed to Brăila and burned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before retreating to Adrianople. Both sides would claim victory, while Mehmed II's forces returned home with many captured slaves, horses and cattle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E

50|$|After a {{windstorm}} {{damaged the}} building in 1950, <b>the</b> association voted <b>to</b> sell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shelburne Museum {{so that it could}} be preserved. In 1952, the Shelburne Museum dismantled the building and moved <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> finding replacements for missing or damaged elements, including the belfry, pews, and pulpit, in an abandoned church in Milton, Vermont. The interior plaster walls were painted in tones of white and grey to resemble paneled woodwork(see Trompe-l'œil).|$|R
5|$|Aurelian {{spared the}} city and {{stationed}} a garrison of 600 archers, led by Sandarion, as a peacekeeping force. In 273 Palmyra rebelled {{under the leadership of}} Septimius Apsaios, declaring Antiochus (a relative of Zenobia) as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his Temple of Sol. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{retreated from}} the area to fight off an Ottoman invasion. Before leaving, he garrisoned the fort of Baleč (Balsha) near Dagnum, {{under the command of}} Marin Spani. Andrea Venier ordered the capture of Baleci after Skanderbeg had left, forcing Marin Spani to {{evacuate}} it. Venier then burned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In retaliation, Hamza Kastrioti, one of Spani's colleagues, attacked a nearby Venetian fortress with what little men he had, but was defeated.|$|E
5|$|When dawn came, the Megalopolitans {{realised}} {{that the}} Spartans {{had entered the}} city; some of them fled, while others stood and fought against the invaders. Cleomenes' superior numbers forced the defenders to retreat, but their rearguard action allowed most of the population to escape—only 1,000 were captured. Cleomenes {{sent a message to}} Messene, where the exiles had gathered, offering to give back their city if they became his allies. The Megalopolitans refused; in retaliation the Spartans ransacked the city and burnt <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Nicholas Hammond estimated that Cleomenes managed to accumulate around 300 talents of loot from the city.|$|E

5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E
5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emperor Trajan recommenced {{hostilities}} against Dacia and, {{following an}} uncertain number of battles, defeated the Dacian general Decebalus in the Second Battle of Tapae in 101 AD. With Trajan's troops pressing towards the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa, Decebalus once more sought terms. Decebalus rebuilt his {{power over the}} following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in 105 AD. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia, besieging the Dacian capital in the Siege of Sarmizethusa, and razing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently invaded the Parthian empire to the east, his conquests taking the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome's borders in the east were indirectly governed through a system of client states for some time, leading to less direct campaigning than in the west in this period.|$|E

5|$|In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the {{fortress}} of Modica also fell, while the Byzantines, now {{at peace with}} the Abbasid Caliphate, received reinforcements from the eastern theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and {{the fortress}} of Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender it to the Muslims, who razed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> At {{about the same time}} (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard {{the news of the}} massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Normandy {{continued}} to disintegrate into chaos. In 1105, Henry sent his friend Robert Fitzhamon and {{a force of}} knights into the Duchy, apparently to provoke a confrontation with Duke Robert. Fitzhamon was captured, and Henry used this {{as an excuse to}} invade, promising to restore peace and order. Henry had the support of most of the neighbouring counts around Normandy's borders, and King Philip of France was persuaded to remain neutral. Henry occupied western Normandy, and advanced east on Bayeux, where Fitzhamon was held. The city refused to surrender, and Henry besieged it, burning <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Terrified of meeting the same fate, the town of Caen switched sides and surrendered, allowing Henry to advance on Falaise, which he took with some casualties. Henry's campaign stalled, and the King instead began peace discussions with Robert. The negotiations were inconclusive and the fighting dragged on until Christmas, when Henry returned to England.|$|E

5|$|One {{high-profile}} {{case that}} illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence {{was that of}} ex-slave George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dinning saved enough money to purchase a farm in Simpson County. On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10days. Dinning denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dinning retrieved a gun from his house and fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dinning turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tecumseh, not {{yet ready}} to oppose the United States by force, was away {{recruiting}} allies when Harrison's army arrived. Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader but not a military man, was in charge. Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day. Early the next morning, however, warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison's army. Although the outnumbered attackers took Harrison's army by surprise, Harrison and his men stood their ground for more than two hours. The Native Americans were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low. After the battle, they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison's men burned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> destroying the food supplies stored for the winter. The soldiers returned to their homes.|$|E
5|$|The ancient chronicles mention {{two tests}} that Dutthagamani planned {{to find out}} these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large {{cauldron}} of toddy, intending to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala stepped forward and drank the entire cauldron without any effort. The second test was to test Nandimithra, {{the commander of the}} army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to {{all parts of the}} tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Tawau, the region around it {{was the subject of}} dispute between the British and Dutch spheres of influence. In 1893, the first British merchant vessel sailed into Tawau, marking the opening of the town's sea port. In 1898, the British set up a settlement in Tawau. The British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBC) accelerated growth of the settlement's population by encouraging the immigration of Chinese. Consequent to the Japanese occupation of North Borneo, the Allied forces bombed the town, in mid-1944, razing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> After the Japanese surrender in 1945, 2,900 Japanese soldiers in Tawau became prisoners of war and were transferred to Jesselton. Tawau was rebuilt after the war, {{and by the end of}} 1947, the economy was restored to its pre-war status. Tawau was also the main point of conflict during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation from 1963 to 1966. During that period, it was garrisoned by the British Special Boat Section, and guarded by Australian Destroyers and combat aircraft. In December 1963, Tawau was bombed twice by Indonesia and shootings occurred across the Tawau-Sebatik Island international border. Indonesians were found trying to poison the town's water supply. In January 1965, a curfew was imposed to prevent Indonesian attackers from making contact with Indonesians living in the town. While in June 1965, another attempted invasion by the Indonesian forces was repelled by bombardment by an Australian destroyer. Military conflict finally ended in December 1966.|$|E
