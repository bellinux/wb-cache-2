5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the music played by an organ <b>grinder.</b> The organ <b>grinder</b> earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ <b>grinder</b> instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} synopsis differs from the actual production in a few aspects. When the organ <b>grinder</b> takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ <b>grinder</b> does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In the published synopsis the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E

50|$|Special purpose coffee <b>grinders</b> {{usually are}} either blade <b>grinders</b> or burr grinders: blade <b>grinders</b> being less {{expensive}} and having additional uses, burr <b>grinders</b> giving {{a better quality of}} grind (see Coffee preparation#Grinding). Special purpose spice <b>grinders</b> usually are either blade <b>grinders</b> or mortar and pestle (or related tools).|$|R
50|$|Bench <b>grinders</b> are {{standard}} equipment in metal fabrication shops and machine shops, as are handheld <b>grinders</b> (such as angle <b>grinders</b> and die <b>grinders).</b>|$|R
50|$|Angle <b>grinders</b> are {{standard}} equipment in metal fabrication shops and on construction sites. They are also common in machine shops, along with die <b>grinders</b> and bench <b>grinders.</b>|$|R
5|$|The basement, and {{for part}} of the home's history, the main living area, is {{accessed}} via a staircase {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall. The steep stairs still show years of wear.

5|$|In the 2001 off-season, Bieksa {{was drafted}} by the Vancouver Canucks with the 151st pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. He {{returned}} to Bowling Green to complete his four-year college career after being drafted, recording 15 points in 2001–02. Bieksa was named an alternate captain to D'Arcy McConvey prior to his third season and subsequently improved to a college career-high eight goals and 25 points in 2002–03.

He was also given his first of two consecutive honourable mentions as a CCHA All-Academic.|$|E
5|$|Defeated Sanity {{was formed}} in Dachsbach, Germany in 1994 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and drummer Lille Gruber, {{initially}} as a side project. In 1996, bassist Jonas Gruber and vocalist Robert Colnik joined the band as session musicians. This line-up recorded the first two demos, Devoured by the Black in the same year, followed by Withdrawn from Beauty in 1998. After undergoing a line-up change, Defeated Sanity eventually recruited guitarist Christian Müenzner and bassist Tino Köhler. Colnik departed the band shortly after recording a demo in 2000. He was replaced by Markus Keller, who re-recorded a track from the demo; the track was included on the split with Poppy Seed <b>Grinder,</b> released through the Czech label Grodhaisn in 2001. Later that year, Münzner left the band to join Necrophagist. Defeated Sanity released a 7-inch split EP with Brazilian death metal band Imperious Malevolence through Merciless Records in 2003.|$|E

50|$|Some angle <b>grinders,</b> most tile saws, {{and some}} <b>grinders</b> for {{sharpening}} blades used in woodworking are wet <b>grinders.</b> The fluid helps with lubrication of the cutting process and with cooling to avoid cracking or damaging {{the cutting tool}} or the workpiece.|$|R
5|$|The film {{begins with}} two {{unemployed}} parents obtaining employment {{in an upcoming}} theater production. Shortly after returning home, the landlady shows up and demands the rent, but can not collect. She gives them one week, but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work. While they are out, the landlady finds a tenant and puts the children out on the street. They end up dancing for an organ <b>grinder</b> and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill. The parents come into a fortune and are reunited by their children at the theater. The film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario, but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of Edwin Thanhouser's company. A print of the film exists, {{but it was the}} subject of nitrate deterioration.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} <b>grinder</b> is a bench <b>grinder</b> or {{a hand-held}} angle <b>grinder,</b> for deburring parts or cutting metal with a zip-disc.|$|E
25|$|Coffee beans may {{be ground}} in several ways. A burr <b>grinder</b> uses {{revolving}} elements to shear the seed; a blade <b>grinder</b> cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and {{a mortar and}} pestle crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr <b>grinder</b> is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.|$|E
50|$|Electric burr <b>grinders</b> are {{powered by}} {{electricity}} from a battery or mains supply. An electric motor drives the grinding elements against each other. Electric <b>grinders</b> grind faster than manual <b>grinders</b> with no effort, butfriction and waste {{heat from the}} motor may heat the ground product slightly.|$|R
50|$|Disc {{grinding}} {{is similar}} to surface grinding, but with a larger contact area between disc and workpiece. Disc <b>grinders</b> are available in both vertical and horizontal spindle types. Double disc <b>grinders</b> work {{both sides of a}} workpiece simultaneously. Disc <b>grinders</b> are capable of achieving especially fine tolerances.|$|R

5000|$|According to Biohack.me, [...] "Grinders {{are passionate}} {{individuals}} {{who believe the}} tools and knowledge of science belong to everyone. <b>Grinders</b> practice functional extreme body modification {{in an effort to}} improve the human condition. <b>Grinders</b> hack themselves with electronic hardware to extend and improve human capacities. <b>Grinders</b> believe in action, their bodies the experiment." ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{cities in}} the United Kingdom also had {{ordinances}} prohibiting organ <b>grinders.</b> The authorities often encouraged policemen to treat the <b>grinders</b> as beggars or public nuisances.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{widespread}} adoption of weed as a recreational drug in early 2010s, herb <b>grinders</b> have {{become synonymous with}} weed <b>grinders.</b> There are many types of herb <b>grinders</b> out there, from electric to hand cranked, in various styles. Advertisements describing them as [...] "spice grinders" [...] have sometimes confused buyers who were unaware the actual intended use.|$|R

25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off <b>grinder.</b> The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off <b>grinder</b> is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>grinders</b> for knife {{sharpening}} duty {{are of the}} wet type, {{in which}} {{the bottom of the}} wheel runs within a pan of water or other coolant. A tube may also deliver a stream of coolant {{near the top of the}} wheel. These <b>grinders</b> are not always called bench <b>grinders,</b> but they are among the class of benchtop grinding machines.|$|R
50|$|Impact wrenches, pulse tools, nutrunners, screwdrivers, drills, <b>grinders,</b> die <b>grinders,</b> sanders, {{dental drills}} and other {{pneumatic}} tools {{use a variety}} of air motors. These include vane type motors, turbines and piston motors.|$|R
25|$|A bench <b>grinder</b> {{is usually}} {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable <b>grinder</b> is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle {{includes}} the following specialized equipment for repair duties: an air compressor, electric power unit, battery charger, testing unit, portable drill and <b>grinder,</b> tire repair set, radiator set, tool set, greasing equipment, hydraulic jack, oxy acetylene set, recovery equipment and a tent.|$|E
25|$|Grinders have {{increased}} in size and complexity with advances in time and technology.

2500|$|In general, {{fighters who}} cannot win fights through {{lightning}} offense, or are {{more suited to}} win fights in the later rounds or via decision {{are commonly known as}} <b>grinders.</b> [...] <b>Grinders</b> aim to shut down their opponent's game plan and chip away at them via clinching, smothering and ground-and-pound for most of the rounds. Prominent examples of <b>grinders</b> are Pat Healy, Rampage Jackson, and Chael Sonnen.|$|R
50|$|The first {{extruder}} {{was designed}} to manufacture sausages in the 1870s. Packaged dry pasta and breakfast cereals have been produced via extrusion since the 1930s, and the method was applied to pet food production in the 1950s. It has also been incorporated into kitchen appliances, such as meat <b>grinders,</b> herb <b>grinders,</b> coffee <b>grinders,</b> and some types of pasta makers. A similar functional process occurs when using pastry bags.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their Pizza Pot Pies, they {{have a variety of}} salad dinners and sub sandwiches known as <b>grinders.</b> One of the <b>grinders</b> they are known for is the “Italian Combination” that comes in an Italian loaf.
