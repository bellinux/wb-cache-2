30|$|Hypophosphatemia {{has been}} {{noticed in the}} lead-exposed H. fossilis. This is in {{agreement}} with other investigations in which similar effect has been observed after exposure of the fish to other toxicants: organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 a), pyrethroids (deltamethrin (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 b and cypermethrin (Mishra et al. 2001)), cadmium (Rai and Srivastav Ajai 2003) and botanical pesticide (Prasad et al. 2011). Pratap et al. (1989) observed {{no effect on the}} plasma phosphate level of fish treated with cadmium. In contrast, few investigators have noticed hyperphosphatemia in the fish treated with various toxicants; endrin (Colvin and Phillips 1968), endosulfan (Gill et al. 1991), aldrin (Singh et al. 1996), <b>formothion</b> (Singh et al. 1997), and propoxur (Singh et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|In a {{monitoring}} study, {{the effects}} of household processing on removal of organophosphate residues (malathion, fenitrothion, <b>formothion,</b> parathion, methyl parathion and chlorpyriphos) in tomato, bean, okra, eggplant, cauliflower and capsicum were studied. The processes included washing separately with (water, 0. 9 % NaCl, 0. 1 % NaHCO 3, and 0. 1 % acetic acid, 0. 001 % KMnO 4, 0. 1 % ascorbic acid, 0. 1 % malic acid and 0. 1 % oxalic acid and 2 % aqueous solution of raw Spondias pinnata (SP)) and boiling. Organophosphorous (OP) residues were estimated (for real market samples and spiked samples) using multi residue analytical technique employing with capillary gas chromatograph with mass spectrometry detector (GCMSD). In all of the vegetables, washing with different household chemicals reduced the residues by 20 - 89 % and boiling reduced the residues by 52 - 100 %. Boiling of vegetables {{was found to be}} more effective than washing in dislodging the residues. </p...|$|E
3000|$|Lead {{exposure}} to H. fossilis provoked hypocalcemia. This derives {{support from the}} studies of Rogers et al. (2003) who have also reported hypocalcemia in lead-exposed rainbow trout. Other investigators have also noticed decreased blood/plasma calcium content of fish treated either with aldrin (Bano 1982; Singh et al. 1996), malachite green (Srivastava et al. 1995), cadmium (Larsson et al. 1981; Muramoto 1981; Giles 1984; Kuroshima 1987; Pratap et al. 1989, Rai and Srivastav Ajai 2003), propoxur (Singh et al. 1997), <b>formothion</b> (Singh et al. 1997), chlorpyrifos (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 a), deltamethrin (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 b), methyl-parathion (Mishra et al. 2004), cypermethrin (Mishra et al. 2005) or botanical pesticide (Prasad et al. 2011). Contrary to it, an elevation of plasma calcium concentrations has also been reported by other workers from the fish exposed to various toxicants (Sastry and Sharma 1978; Bansal et al. 1979; Sharma et al. 1982). However, no effect on plasma calcium level has been noticed in methoxychlor-exposed Northern puffer Sphaeroides maculatus (Eisler 1967 and DDT-treated flounders Platichthys flesus(Haux [...]) 1979).|$|E
40|$|Analysis using {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of four strains of the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, collected from cotton in Turkey showed all insects to be assignable to the geographically widespread B biotype of this species. Bioassays with appropriate life-stages were used to investigate the status of resistance to two pyrethroid insecticides (bifenthrin and fenpropathrin), two organophosphates (OPs) (<b>formothion</b> and triazophos) and an insect growth regulator (buprofezin). All four strains showed significant resistance to pyrethroids (57 - to 360 -fold) and OPs (20 - to 310 -fold). Resistance to buprofezin was found only in a strain from Izmir. Total non-specific esterase activities were 7. 4 - 11 -fold greater than in an in secticide-susceptible strain, and were likely to account, in part at least, for resistance to pyrethroids. Inhibition assays with acetylcholinesterase also implicated target-site modification as a mechanism of resistance to OPs. The data update previous results on the resistance status of B. tabaci in Turkey and the implications for managing resistance on cotton and other whitefly hosts are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
