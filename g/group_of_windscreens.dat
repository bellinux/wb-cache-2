40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, windscreen models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm & 10 mm). Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned windscreen was investigated. It was observed that the area of crack and the peak value of headform acceleration are determined by the critical fracture stress and 50 MPa fracture stress of glass best predicts the headform acceleration level and the cracks <b>of</b> <b>windscreen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{power source}} <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper is motor, {{which is the}} core of the entire wiper system and is very high quality requirements. The wiper motor {{installed}} on the front windshield and worm gears are generally made of one mechanical part. The four-bar linkage of windshield wiper of automobile is driven by motor through worm gears. The method of simulated annealing is a technique that has attracted significant attention as suitable for optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where a desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. The simulated annealing algorithm with penalty strategy is adopted to solve the optimal model <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper mechanism, thus motion accuracy of wiper mechanism is greatly increased, and the searching number is greatly decreased...|$|R

5000|$|A simple single-blade setup with {{a center}} pivot (Fig. 4) is {{commonly}} used on rear windshields, {{as well as on}} the front of some cars. Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system (Fig. 5) called the [...] "Monoblade", based on cantilevers, in which a single arm extends outward to reach the top corners <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> and pulls in at the ends and middle of the stroke, sweeping out a somewhat [...] "M"-shaped path. This way, a single blade is able to cover more <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> displacing any residual streaks away from the center <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many {{commercial}} vehicles, especially buses {{with large}} windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One {{of the arms}} {{is attached to the}} motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> on each wipe. However, it also usually requires the wiper to be [...] "parked" [...] in the middle <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger. Triumph cars, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R

40|$|A good {{knowledge}} of the contact properties between the windscreen and the head during an impact is necessary to obtain a reliable pedestrian-vehicle crash simulation. Unlike {{other parts of the}} vehicle, the windscreen may crack as well as bend during an impact. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the behaviour of a head impact on a windscreen and to design a multibody contact model <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> impact which accounts for rate-dependent damping effects. Subsystem impact tests were used to define contact-impact characteristics that correctly account for damping. Two phases can be distinguished in these characteristics. The first part corresponds to the bending and the fracture <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> whereas the second part corresponds to the bending <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> once it is broken. The characteristics were then implemented in a multibody model and the subsystem impact tests were simulated in order to validate it by comparison with experimental tests. The results from the numerical windscreen model are consistent with the results from the subsystem tests. Comparison of head injury criterion (HIC) values gives an additional validation of the consistency of our model. Contact properties, multibody simulation, pedestrian-vehicle cras...|$|R

5000|$|Some larger {{cars are}} {{equipped}} with hidden wipers (or depressed-park wipers). When wipers are switched off in standard non-hidden designs, a [...] "parking" [...] mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area near the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> but still in sight. For designs that hide the wipers, the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the hood, and the wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen,</b> but out <b>of</b> sight.|$|R
50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep {{getting out of the car}} to clear it. This experience led to his invention <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> wiper. In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design <b>of</b> a <b>windscreen</b> wiper with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool. Gladstone's version <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> wiper was never manufactured, however. His original prototype can be seen in Newcastle's Discovery Museum.|$|R
50|$|First {{seen on the}} 1985 Ford Scorpio/Granada Mk. III in Europe and the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable in the U.S., {{the system}} uses a mesh of very thin heating wires, or a silver/zinc oxide coated film {{embedded}} between two layers <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> glass. The overall effect when operative was defogging and defrosting <b>of</b> the <b>windscreen</b> {{at a very high}} rate. Landrover (UK) also fitted a similar screen to their Discovery range in the early 1990s, some of which were imported to Australia undetected by authorities, because at that stage they were not legal in any state. Owing to the high current draw, the system is engineered to operate only when the engine is running, and normally switches off after 10 minutes of operation. The metallic content of the glass has been shown to degrade the performance of certain windshield-mounted accessories, such as GPS navigators, telephone antennas and radar detectors.|$|R

40|$|The wear <b>of</b> the <b>windscreens</b> as one {{important}} traffic safety {{problem has been}} observed in many studies. Transmission loss <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> could {{play an important role}} in a person‟s possibilities to detect objects on the road. It has been estimated that up to 90 % of the information used by drivers to drive their cars is visual. When driving with a worn <b>windscreen,</b> the risk <b>of</b> dazzling increases. It can lead to the consequence that the driver does not discover objects or people in the driving environment. The goal with this thesis is to propose a method for quantitative measurement of the visibility degradation on worn windscreens. It should correlate with customer expectations which require a quick and easy method. This test should be possible to apply at the annual quality check of automobiles at motor vehicle inspection. The thesis work was carried out at Industrial metrology and optics, of the school of Industrial Engineering and Management, Kungliga Tekniska högskolan with support of Svenska Glaskontroll AB. The transparency degradation <b>of</b> a <b>windscreen</b> mainly caused by the incident light beam diffusion due to scattering at small surface defects such as scratches and impact sites. As worn windscreens have more surface defects, the scattering of incident light would be stronger than the new ones, which could cause more windscreen transmission loss. In this thesis we measured the light scattering on four windscreens with different mileages by digital photography techniques. The test was undergoing at a fixed light angle, which is according to the test done in the Swedish Road and Traffic Safety Institute (VTI). Four windscreens were investigated with mileages of 0 km, 26000 km, 107945 km, 170000 km. The results are shown by data of the brightness of the pictures <b>of</b> the <b>windscreens</b> which indicate how strong the light scattering on the windscreens was. Also a comparison was made by overlap the pictures of the scattering sites <b>of</b> different <b>windscreens</b> with road scenes to see how the light scattering affects driving. Moreover, we use a software Fiji to analyze the number and area of the scattering sites on the windscreens...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{legislation}} of periodical vehicle inspection, windscreens are examined to see if they fulfil the specifications. Damage to windscreens can cause a decrease of vision and/or crack. On parking places 840 cars were studied at random for such damage.

In the strict application of the current interpretation of the specifications of vehicle inspection more windscreens will be condemned than is really necessary. The presence of cracks in laminated windscreens will generally not lead to sudden visual hindrance. The specifications should therefore be modified...|$|R
