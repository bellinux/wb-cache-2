2500|$|One {{example of}} an active effort to prevent the genericization of a {{trademark}} {{was that of the}} Lego Company, which printed in manuals in the 1970s and 1980s a request to customers that they call the company's interlocking plastic building blocks [...] "'Lego bricks', 'blocks' or 'toys', and not 'Legos'." [...] While this went largely unheeded, and many children and adults in the U.S. referred to and continue to refer to the pieces as [...] "Legos", use of the <b>deprecated</b> <b>term</b> remained largely confined to the Lego Company's own products – and not, for example, to Tyco's competing and interchangeable product – so genericization of the Lego trademark did not occur. Adobe Systems is working to prevent the genericization of their trademarks, such as Photoshop, but has mixed success. This is shown via recurring use of the verb [...] "photoshopped", or the shortened version [...] "shopped", throughout the Internet and mass media.|$|E

5000|$|Freud <b>deprecated</b> the <b>term</b> [...] "Electra complex", {{which was}} {{introduced}} by Carl Gustav Jung in 1913 {{in regard to the}} Oedipus complex manifested in young girls. Freud further proposed that the Oedipus complex, which originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother, is a desire for the parent in both males and females, and that boys and girls experience the complex differently: boys in a form of castration anxiety, girls in a form of penis envy.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{deprecated}} {{may also}} be used when a technical term becomes obsolete, either through change or supersession. An example from paleontology is the previously <b>deprecated</b> <b>term</b> Brontosaurus; before being re-recognized as a unique genus, it was considered a popular, yet deprecated, name for the genus Apatosaurus. Some examples of deprecated terms from medicine include consumption (tuberculosis), grippe (influenza), and apoplexy (stroke). In chemistry, the international standards organization IUPAC has deprecated the term [...] "methyl ethyl ketone", and now recommends using the term [...] "ethyl methyl ketone" [...] instead.|$|E
5000|$|The Nicoleño {{language}} has been extinct since Juana Maria's death. Its extant remnants consist only of four words and two songs attributed to her. This evidence was recorded by non-speakers, as contemporary accounts are clear {{that no one}} could be found who could understand Juana Maria. Based on the limited evidence, Alfred L. Kroeber in 1907 identified it as a [...] "Shoshonean" [...] language - a <b>deprecated</b> <b>term</b> for Northern Uto-Aztecan languages - and associated it with the Takic branch that includes Tongva (Gabrielino), spoken on Santa Catalina Island and the adjacent coast, and Luiseño, spoken to the south. Most subsequent linguists have followed Kroeber's conclusions.|$|E
5000|$|Nonmagmatic {{meteorite}} (also nonmagmatic iron meteorite) is a <b>deprecated</b> <b>term</b> formerly used in meteoritics {{to describe}} iron meteorites that were originally {{thought to have}} not formed by igneous processes, to differentiate them from the magmatic meteorites, produced by the crystallization of a metal melt. The concept behind this {{was developed in the}} 1970s, but it was quickly realized that igneous processes actually {{play a vital role in}} the formation of the so-called [...] "nonmagmatic" [...] meteorites. Today, the terms are still sometimes used, but usage is discouraged because of the ambiguous meanings of the terms magmatic and nonmagmatic. The meteorites that were described to be nonmagmatic are now understood to be the product of partial melting and impact events and are grouped with the primitive achondrites and the achondrites.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{relative}} permittivity is {{the ratio of}} the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared with a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric.

40|$|Vocabularies {{are used}} for {{modeling}} data in Knowledge Graphs (KG) like the Linked Open Data Cloud and Wikidata. During their lifetime, the vocabularies of the KGs are subject to changes. New terms are coined, while existing terms are modified or declared as deprecated. We first quantify the amount and frequency of changes in vocabularies. Subsequently, we investigate to which extend and when the changes are adopted {{in the evolution of}} the KGs. We conduct our experiments on three large-scale KGs for which time-stamped snapshots are available, namely the Billion Triples Challenge datasets, Dynamic Linked Data Observatory dataset, and Wikidata. Our results show that the change frequency of terms is rather low, but can have high impact when adopted on a large amount of distributed graph data on the web. Furthermore, not all coined terms are used and most of the <b>deprecated</b> <b>terms</b> are still used by data publishers. There are variations in the adoption time of terms coming from different vocabularies ranging from very fast (few days) to very slow (few years). Surprisingly, there are also adoptions we could observe even before the vocabulary changes are published. Understanding this adoption is important, since otherwise it may lead to wrong assumptions about the modeling status of data published on the web and may result in difficulties when querying the data from distributed sources...|$|R
50|$|IUPAC has {{deprecated}} {{the use of}} {{the term}} polydispersity index, having replaced it with the term dispersity, represented by the symbol Đ (pronounced D-stroke) which can refer to either molecular mass or degree of polymerization. It can be calculated using the equation ĐM = Mw/Mn, where Mw is the weight-average molar mass and Mn is the number-average molar mass. It can also be calculated according to degree of polymerization, where ĐX = Xw/Xn, where Xw is the weight-average degree of polymerization and Xn is the number-average degree of polymerization. In certain limiting cases where ĐM = ĐX, it is simply referred to as Đ. IUPAC has also <b>deprecated</b> the <b>terms</b> monodisperse, which is considered to be self-contradictory, and polydisperse, which is considered redundant, preferring the terms uniform and non-uniform instead.|$|R

5000|$|The EWF was {{at first}} made up {{primarily}} of Ethiopian students who came to America to study abroad, after the official coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie. It gained support from the Black community of Harlem, and <b>deprecated</b> the <b>term</b> [...] "Negro" [...] in favour of an African and Ethiopian identity. Bayen set up the EWF's newspaper, The Voice of Ethiopia, and led the project of federating the EWF. The first branch of the EWF outside the United States {{was set up in}} Kingston, Jamaica, and by 1940 there were EWF chapters in various parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Bayen died in 1940 and was succeeded as leader by Lij Araya Abebe, then in 1943 by Elks Exalted Ruler Finley Wilson, by which time it had become a Black American organization rather than an Ethiopian-led one.|$|R
50|$|In Ukraine, the {{classification}} of Boykos and other Rusyns as an East Slavic ethnicity, distinct from Ukrainians is controversial. (The <b>deprecated</b> and archaic <b>term</b> Ruthenian, while it is also derived from Rus', is ambiguous, as it technically may refer to Rusyns and Ukrainians, as well as Belarusians and even Russians, depending on the historical period.) According to the 2011 Ukraine census only 131 people identified themselves as Boykos, separate from Ukrainians. However, this figure is distorted for two reasons: some people otherwise identifiable as Boykos regard that name as derogatory, In the Polish census of 2011, 258 people identified their nationality as Boyko, with 14 people listing it as their only national identification.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1950s, {{the term}} [...] "experimental" [...] was often applied by {{conservative}} music critics—along {{with a number}} of other words, such as [...] "engineers art", [...] "musical splitting of the atom", [...] "alchemist's kitchen", [...] "atonal", and [...] "serial"—as a <b>deprecating</b> jargon <b>term,</b> which must be regarded as [...] "abortive concepts", since they did not [...] "grasp a subject" [...] This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions [...] In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a [...] "new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment." [...] He concludes, [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} experimental music … but there is a very real distinction between sterility and invention" [...] Starting in the 1960s, [...] "experimental music" [...] began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, [...] "outsider" [...] composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the [...] "genre's" [...] own definition the work it includes is [...] "radically different and highly individualistic" [...] It is therefore not a genre, but an open category, [...] "because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial" [...] Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance [...] "guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common" [...]|$|R
