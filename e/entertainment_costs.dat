Due to its underperformance, The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "the second big-budget miss for Lionsgate {{this year after}} Gods of Egypt." [...] Many critics have blamed the underperformance of the film on Lionsgates decision to split the last novel into two pictures. As a result, Lionsgate will cut {{the budget of the}} fourth and final movie in the series, Ascendant. Due to the box office struggles of Allegiant, Lionsgate has planned to wrap up the film series with a television movie which it then hopes to continue as a spinoff. Made on a total budget of $183.6 million, including net production budget, advertising and promotion costs, and domestic home <b>entertainment</b> <b>costs,</b> Deadline.com projects the film to make a mere profit of $3.5 million should it earn a net total of $187.1 million from various platforms (including theatrical revenues, TV rights and DVD sales). By comparison, Divergent made a net profit of $71.8 million and Insurgent $30.6 million.|$|E

Children under thirteen may not be charged. This law {{was put in place}} to resolve the problem of “secret” cover charges, which are indicated only in tiny text on the menu. Clubgoers would then find this cover charge added to their first drink order. In Illinois, bars cannot impose a cover charge unless the fee goes towards the cost of off-setting <b>entertainment</b> <b>costs</b> such as a live band. In 1995, the Italian regional government in Lazio (which includes Rome) began requiring restaurants in the region to remove the cover charge for [...] "Pane e coperto" [...] (bread and cover) from their bills.

5000|$|Matthews, {{whose mother}} was Italian, {{had the support}} of the city's white ethnic communities. {{primarily}} the Jewish, Irish and Italian voters. Matthews, who beat James Ursy, a former school administrator spent a fortune to get elected and then ran up enormous legal bills in a court battle over a recount. In the early 1980s, Leonetti visited Sea Tex Associates several times a week to see Shapiro, including the periods when Matthews was campaigning for mayor and while he was mayor. Shapiro often talked to Leonetti about Matthews’ campaign. Shapiro told Leonetti about the campaign expenses that he was paying for, such as advertising, signs, handouts, bands, as well as personal and <b>entertainment</b> <b>costs</b> for Matthews. Shapiro complained more than once about how much money it was costing him and that Matthews was wasting money on personal expenses. Matthews was elected mayor of Atlantic City a couple of months before Scarfo went to federal prison in August 1982 on his firearms conviction. Shortly after Matthews was elected, Shapiro told Leonetti that he had funneled about $150,000 into Matthews’ campaign. Nicky Scarfo and Phil Leonetti had funneled money into Matthews' campaign to get zoning and planning approvals, variances and contracts for Scarfo, Inc. cement contracting company that was run by Phil Leonetti. After moving into Atlantic City, {{he was elected to the}} City Commission in 1980, serving as director of Revenue and Finance.|$|E

Ferrers survived Somerset's downfall in October 1549 and execution in January 1552, and was appointed by the Duke of Northumberland to devise entertainments to amuse the young King Edward VI during the Christmas season of 1551-2. The then Master of the Revels, Sir Thomas Cawarden (a former fellow page of the chamber with Ferrers), was told by Northumberland to assist Ferrers.

50|$|These {{television}} programs tend to air {{once or twice}} for every weekday as part of daytime television and often cost little to create (under $200,000 a week, where <b>entertainment</b> magazines <b>cost</b> five times that). Like talk shows, the procedure of court shows varies based upon the titular host. In most cases, they are first-run syndication programs. In 2001, the genre began to beat out soap operas in daytime television ratings. While all syndicated shows are steadily losing audiences, court shows have the slowest rate of viewer erosion. Accordingly, {{by the end of}} the 2000s, the number of court shows in syndication had, for the first time, equaled the number of talk shows. As reported in late 2012, court programming is the second highest-rated genre on daytime television.
