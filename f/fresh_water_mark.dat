60|$|As a {{great deal}} of sand and mud had been brought up by the eruption, there was no want of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Mark</b> found even a little brook, of as {{perfectly}} sweet a stream as he had ever tasted in America, running into the little harbour where he had secured the boat. He followed this stream two miles, ere he reached its source, or sources; for it came from at least, a dozen copious springs, that poured their tribute from a bed of clean sand several miles in length, and which had every sign of having been bare for ages. In saying this, however, it is not to be supposed that the signs, as to time, were very apparent anywhere. Lava, known to have been ejected from the bowels of the earth thousands of years, has just as fresh an appearance, to the ordinary observer, as that which was thrown out ten years ago; and, {{had it not been for}} the deposits of moist mud, the remains of fish, sea-weed that was still undecayed, pools of salt water, and a few other peculiarities of the same sort, Mark would have been puzzled to find any difference between the rocks recently thrown up, and those which were formerly exposed to the air. Even the mud was fast changing its appearance, cracking and drying under the sun of the tropics. In a month or two, should as much rain as usual fall, it was probable the sea-weed would be far gone in decay.|$|E
60|$|The dingui was {{no great}} {{matter of a}} boat, and they had not much {{difficulty}} in getting it into the water. First by slinging, it was swayed high enough to clear the rail, when Bob bore it over the side, and Mark lowered away. It {{was found to be}} tight, Captain Crutchely having kept it half full of water ever since they got into the Pacific, and in other respects it was in good order. It was even provided with a little sail, which did very well before the wind. While Bob saw to provisioning the boat, and filling its breakers with <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> <b>Mark</b> attended to another piece of duty that he conceived to be of the last importance. The Rancocus carried several guns, an armament prepared to repel the savages of the sandal-wood islands, and these guns were all mounted and in their places. There were two old-fashioned sixes, and eight twelve-pound carronades. The first made smart reports when properly loaded. Our young mate now got the keys of the magazine, opened it, and brought forth three cartridges, with which he loaded three of the guns. These guns he fired, with short intervals between them, in hopes that the reports would be carried to the ears of some of the missing people, and encourage them to make every effort to return. The roar of artillery sounded strangely enough in the midst of that vast solitude; and Bob Betts, who had often been in action, declared that he was much affected by it, As no immediate result was expected from the firing of these guns, Mark had no sooner discharged them, than he joined Betts, who by this time had everything ready, and prepared to quit the ship. Before he did this, however, he made an anxious and careful survey of the weather it being all-important to be certain no change in this respect was likely to occur in his absence. All the omens were favourable, and Bob reporting for the third time that everything was ready, the young man went over the side, and descended, with a reluctance he could not conceal, into the boat. Certainly, it was no trifling matter for men in the situation of our two mariners, to leave their vessel all alone, to be absent for {{a large portion of the}} day. It was to be done, however; though it was done reluctantly, and not without many misgivings, in spite of the favourable signs in the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Water flux {{rates and}} osmotic {{responses}} of Kemp's Ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempi) acutely exposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> were quantified. Salt-water adapted turtles {{were exposed to}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for 4 d before being returned to salt water. During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively. When turtles were exposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> rates increased by approximately 30 %. Upon return to salt water, rates decreased to original levels. Plasma osmolality, Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) decreased during exposure to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> and subsequently increased during the return to salt water. The Na(+) :K(+) ratio was elevated during the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> phase and subsequently decreased upon return to salt water. Aldosterone and corticosterone were not altered during exposure to <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Elevated water flux rates during <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> exposure reflected an increase in water consumption, resulting in a decrease in ionic and osmotic concentrations.

50|$|Changing {{landscape}} {{for the use}} of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> in the local environment and also affects the cycle of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> As a result, more <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. In Australia, over-abstraction of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.

40|$|A {{time series}} of summer <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> content {{anomalies}} (FWCA) over the Laptev and East Siberian sea shelves was constructed from historical hydrographic {{records for the}} period from 1920 to 2005. Results from a multiple regression between FCWA and various atmospheric and oceanic indices show that the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> content on the shelves is mainly controlled by atmospheric vorticity on quasi-decadal timescales. When the vorticity of the atmosphere on the shelves is antycyclonic, approximately 500 km 3 of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> migrates from the eastern Siberian shelf to the Arctic Ocean through the northeastern Laptev Sea. When the vorticity of the atmosphere is cyclonic, this <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> remains on the southern Laptev and East Siberian sea shelves. This FWCA represents approximately 35 % of the total <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> inflow provided by river discharge and local sea-ice melt, and is about ten {{times larger than the}} standard deviation of the Lena River summer long-term mean discharge. However, the large interannual and spatial variability in the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> content of the shelves, as well as the spatial coverage of the hydrographic data, makes it difficult to detect the long-term tendency of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> storage associated with climate change...|$|R

40|$|During glacial periods, {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{increases and}} decreases by around 15 ppm. At the same time, the climate changes gradually in Antarctica. Such climate {{changes can be}} simulated in models when the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Oceanic Circulation) is weakened by adding <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to the North Atlantic. The impact on the carbon cycle is less straightforward, and previous studies give opposite results. Because the models and the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes were different in these studies, it prevents any direct comparison and hinders finding whether the discrepancies arise from using different models or different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In this study we use the CLIMBER- 2 coupled climate carbon model to explore the impact of different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In both preindustrial and glacial states, the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting slow-down of the AMOC lead to an uptake of carbon by the ocean and a release by the terrestrial biosphere. The duration, shape and amplitude of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux all {{have an impact on}} the change of atmospheric CO 2 because they modulate the change of the AMOC. The maximum CO 2 change linearly depends on the time integral of the AMOC change. The different duration, amplitude, and shape of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux cannot explain the opposite evolution of ocean and vegetation carbon inventory in different models. The different CO 2 evolution thus depends on the AMOC response to the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting climatic change, which are both model dependent. In CLIMBER- 2, the rise of CO 2 recorded in ice cores during abrupt events can be simulated under glacial conditions, especially when the sinking of brines in the Southern Ocean is taken into account.
