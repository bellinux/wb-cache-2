The <b>grain</b> <b>pan</b> is not coupled with the pre-sieve and top sieve so that each element can operate as its optimum efficiency. The cascade distance between the <b>grain</b> <b>pan</b> and the pre-sieve is increased for greater capacity, while a long sieve stroke and a steep throwing angle keep more material airborne, for even a higher cleaning efficiency. The opposing motion of the <b>grain</b> <b>pan</b> and bottom sieve to the pre-sieve reduces overall machine vibrations and increases operator comfort.|$|E
30|$|Grains of {{wild barley}}, Tibetan Plateau annual wild barley X 74 (Hordeum spontaneum C. Koch), and Nipponbare rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) were surface sterilized by 70 % ethanol for 10  min {{followed}} by 10 % NaClO for 30  min and finally 8 rinses with water. The endosperms in barley and rice grains contain {{a large amount}} of nutrients and therefore provide enough nutrients to sustain the grains for one week following germination. Thus, a simple CaCl 2 solution (0.1  mM CaCl 2; pH  5.8; Pan et al. 2004) was used for barley and rice grain germination and seedling growth. To germinate the barley grains (Pan et al. 2004), sterilized grains were germinated between two layers of wet filter papers with the CaCl 2 solution for one day under darkness (25  °C), and the germinated grains were incubated for another four days in the CaCl 2 solution under darkness (25  °C). To germinate the rice <b>grain</b> (<b>Pan</b> et al. 2011), sterilized grains were treated for three days under darkness (4  °C) and subsequently incubated for 3 days at 37  °C for germination. Finally, the germinated rice grains were transferred to the CaCl 2 solution and incubated for four days under light conditions (14 -h light/ 10 -h dark, 28  °C light/ 25  °C dark). Four-day-old barley and rice seedlings with similar root lengths were used in this study.|$|E

40|$|North Pakistan {{represents}} a highly favourable {{area for a}} variety of mineral deposit types, including arc-related porphyry Cu, Au and Mo and arc and backarc epithermal precious metal deposits (Sweatman et al., 1995; PMDC, 2001). However, few deposits have been discovered in the area, mainly due to its remote nature and inaccessibility, and {{because of a lack of}} exploration tools for high altitude terrains. From stream sediment sampling campaigns by local and international organizations, including a large dataset provided by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), a significant amount of geochemical data now exists for the region. This data has been incorporated into an Arc-GIS 9. 2 database, along with stream catchment and geological information, and detail of all known areas of mineralisation. From this, spatial catchment maps together with multi-element geochemical associations have been studied to delineate areas showing anomalous values for Au and base metals. The two most prospective areas were found to be the Shyok Suture Zone and northern Kohistan, with the dominant control on mineralisation being structural rather than lithological. These areas were targeted for detailed stream sediment sampling and mineralogical and geochemical analysis. From studies of Au and Au pathfinder elements in different size fractions of the stream sediments and heavy mineral concentrates (HMC), the catchments of Teru, Asheriat and Pakora (in order of decreasing rank) were identified as most prospective. Morphological and geochemical analyses of native Au <b>grains</b> from <b>panned</b> concentrates has given an indication of proximity to bedrock source (< 10 km) and the possible styles of mineralisation in these catchments; porphyry Cu-type in Asheriat and Pb-Sb quartz veins in Teru and Pakora. Automated mineralogical analysis of the stream sediments (< 180 µm fraction) and HMC (< 180 µm), using a QEMSCANÒ system, confirmed this interpretation. The effectiveness of the developed methodologies for exploration in remote and high altitude terrains of North Pakistan is discussed, and recommendations made for future exploration.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted at Research Farm of Isfahan University of Technology to examine the relations among phonologic, morphologic and physiologic traits and their effects on grain yield of 20 oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used in each irrigation treatment (i. e. irrigation after 70 ± 3, and 130 ± 3 mm evaporation from class A <b>pan).</b> <b>Grain</b> yield had significant and positive correlations with harvest index and relative water content (RWC) in both irrigation treatments and with plant height at maturity in non-stress condition. Also, grain yield had significant and negative correlation with days to heading. Factor analyses resulted in three factors in each condition, which were named yield factor, phenologic factor and sink factor in both conditions. Based on stepwise regression, harvest index was the first character which entered the grain yield model in both conditions. At the next step, RWC and plant height entered the model, with harvest index explaining 66 % and 64 % of yield variation in stress and non-stress conditions, respectively. The results of path analysis in both conditions showed that harvest index had the highest positive direct effect on grain yield. The highest indirect negative effects through number of grain per panicle were obtained for the harvest index and panicle m- 2 in stress and non-stress conditions, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{comparison}} of detrital zircon ages fromthe Cenozoic forearc basins in SW Ecuador–NW Peru and those derived from theAmotapes Massif offers a singular opportunityto {{shed some light}} on the evolution ofthe NW Andean margin of South America. An extensive set of pre-Andean U-Pb zirconages (older than Late Cretaceous) wasobtained from 18 detrital samples comingfrom the Talara, Zorritos, Progreso, andGulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes forearc basins,as well as from two metasedimentary rocksof the Amotapes Massif. U-Pb age analysison detrital zircon grains allows a generalsource-to-sink scenario to be determinedfor this section of the Andes. These analysesgive consistent insights into the early topographicgrowth during the modern Andeanorogeny, the occurrence of proto-Andeanmagmatic periods in the western margin ofGondwana, and the evolution of the AmotapesMassif within the geodynamical settingof northwestern South America. Zircon agesat ca. 320 Ma and Neoproterozoic clustersfor the Amotapes metasediments show significantsimilarities along the strike of themetamorphic belt, thus defining a commonmetasedimentary origin, and can be comparedwith previously dated rocks from theEastern Cordillera of Peru. These strong similaritiesdemonstrate the presence of a wide,polyphased metamorphic belt that includesthe western parts of the Eastern Cordillera,the northern section of the Occidental Cordilleraof Peru, and the Amotapes Massif. Detrital sediments of the forearc are markedby a major gap in Early Cretaceous–Jurassicages and the minor presence of Ordovician(Famatinian orogeny) and Carboniferous–Permian (340 – 285 Ma) ages. The age spectrumis not compatible with sediment inputfrom the eastern Andes and suggests that theexternal areas of the Andean chain (e. g., theWestern Cordillera) were already upliftedprior to or immediately after forearc initiationduring the Paleocene, thus representinga pervasive drainage divide throughout all ofthe Cenozoic. The Amotapes Massif or otherterrains sharing the same age affinities (e. g.,the Olmosterrane; Occidental Cordillera ofPeru) are likely to represent the best potentialsources for pre-Andean zircon grains in theforearc. Age clusters in both source and sinkat ca. 600 Ma, 570 – 560 Ma, and 520 Ma mostlikely define magmatic periods and may representfirst-order constraints for the difficultcorrelation between proto-Andean magmaticand orogenic periods to the north and southof the Huancabamba deflection. It is unlikelythat the Neoproterozoic zircon <b>grains</b> camefrom the <b>Pan</b> African–Braziliano belts, thussuggesting the onset of significant magmaticactivity in this section of the Andes at around 570 – 560 Ma and probably ca. 600 Ma. The 520 Ma cluster is compatible with the mostprominent magmatic period in the southernAndes related {{to the end of the}} Pampeanorogeny, thus suggesting the existence of aregional proto-Andean magmatic arc duringEarly Cambrian times...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of small-scale {{farmers in the}} Eastern Cape apply inadequate quantities of manure, inorganic (NPK) fertilizer and Gromor as lone fertilizers or tend to mix manure or Gromor with chemical fertilizers for crops, without any scientific basis (Mkile, 2001). Hence this study – aimed at achieving effective and efficient use of chemical fertilizers, manure and Gromor, either as lone fertilizers or mixed with one another, in maize production – was established. A three-year dry land field experiment, arranged in a RCBD with 3 replicates where cattle manure, chemical fertilizer and Gromor were mixed at different ratios – as treatments FM 1 (10 percent fertilizer + 90 percent manure); FM 2 (25 percent fertilizer + 75 percent manure); FM 3 (50 percent fertilizer + 50 percent manure); MAP (100 percent fertilizer); M (100 percent cattle manure); FG 1 (10 percent fertilizer + 90 percent Gromor); FG 2 (25 percent fertilizer + 75 percent Gromor); FG 3 (50 percent fertilizer + 50 percent Gromor); G (100 percent Gromor) and a control (with nothing applied) – was conducted at the Nolukhanyo agricultural project at Bathurst in the Ndlambe Local Municipality. Maize cultivars PAN 6480 and Sahara were used as test crops. Manure, Gromor and soil were analyzed for their nutrient composition. Data recorded involving number of kernels per cob- 1, grain and dry matter (DM) yields for the 2010 - 11, 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 seasons, and leaf area index (LAI) – were subjected to Genstat Version 14. 1 for statistical analysis. <b>Grain</b> yields of <b>PAN</b> 6480 and Sahara recorded in seasons 2010 - 11, 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 were significantly higher (p≤ 0. 05) {{than those of the}} controls. In 2012 - 13, PAN 6480 on treatments FG 3 and FG 1 produced the highest grain yields (5 327 and 5 107 kg ha- 1) respectively, while in 2010 - 11 the highest yield was 3 780 kg ha- 1. In the 2012 - 13 season, Sahara on F treatment was the highest with 4 553 kg ha- 1 whilst {{there were no significant differences}} in F and M treatments. Dry matter yields of Sahara were higher than those of PAN 6480 in all seasons. The highest Sahara LAI obtained on FM 2 was 5. 85 in the 2012 - 13 season, whereas PAN 6480 had LAI of 4. 77 on F treatment, followed by FG 3 with 4. 72 LAI. PAN 6480 number of leaves for 6 plants in m 2 and LAI in week 8 of the 2012 - 13 season had a positive correlation, r 2 = 0. 84. PAN 6480 number of kernels and cob length in the same area correlated quite well (r 2 = 0. 91). Chemical fertilizer corrects the imbalances of nutrients inherent in organic manures and increases both maize grain yields and dry matter yields, and also influences number of leaves and LAI. Treatments FG 1, FG 3 and FM 1 of PAN 6480 resulted in high maize grain yields when planted 13 in late November of the 2012 - 13 growing season and when water in the soil profile was conserved as a result of good rains received prior to planting. Treatments FG 1 (10 percent fertilizer + 90 percent Gromor), FG 3 (50 percent fertilizer + 50 percent Gromor) of PAN 6480 produced the highest grain yields (5 107 kg ha- 1 and 5 327 kg ha- 1 respectively) in the 2012 - 13 season, whilst FM 1 (10 percent fertilizer + 90 percent manure) gave the highest grain yield (of 4 277 kg ha- 1) for the same cultivar in the 2010 - 11 seaso...|$|R
40|$|The Dalradian terrane of {{north-western}} Northern Ireland is {{an attractive}} target for orogenic vein mineralisation. The current high price of gold and the release in 2007 of high-quality regional geochemical and geophysical datatsets from the Tellus project have stimulated a marked revival {{of interest in this}} area. The results of the Tellus project, funded chiefly by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment (DETI), have provided major new insights into the geology and mineral potential of Northern Ireland. Significant vein type orogenic gold mineralisation is known at several localities within this region. Previous studies of the most important deposits at Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw, and a review of similar mineralisation elsewhere in the world, allowed the definition of deposit models to underpin systematic prospectivity analysis of the Dalradian terrane in north-western Northern Ireland. Based on these models key exploration criteria were identified and, where appropriate data were available, these were extracted from various multivariate datasets (geology, geochemistry, geophysics and mineral occurrences). These criteria were then assigned significance weightings, zones and styles of influence based on the exploration model and the views of the team undertaking the analysis. A knowledge-based prospectivity analysis using Fuzzy Logic modelling was then applied to map the favourability for the occurrence of deposits of this type within the Dalradian terrane. ESRI’s Arc Spatial Data Modeller version 3. 1 (Arc SDM) software was employed for this purpose. The key exploration criteria are certain structural vectors and elevated values for gold and associated elements in Tellus stream-sediment geochemical data. On account of the apparent differences in the importance of structures of various orientations at Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw, and the contrast in the geochemicalmineralogical characteristics of the ores, two separate prospectivity models were applied in this study, one for Curraghinalt and the other for Cavanacaw. Mineral occurrence information from the GSNI MINLOCS database and the occurrence of gold <b>grains</b> observed during <b>panning</b> of stream sediments were also incorporated in the analysis. Regional prospectivity analysis, covering an area of 3074 km 2, using the two models identified 22 prospective targets for orogenic vein style gold mineralisation disposed in four groups. Many of the targets coincide with known orogenic gold occurrences while others occur in areas identified as prospective by previous workers. However in some areas the size of the targets has increased and elsewhere new targets have been identified beyond the main Lack – Curraghinalt zone. Of particular interest is a series of targets trending west-north-west, which passes through Curraghinalt and Golan Burn, which may relate to the major fault bounding the southern side of the Newtownstewart Basin. Another series of targets, disposed along a near-linear trend with a similar orientation, is identified {{to the north of the}} Omagh-Kesh Basin. A possible interpretation of these results is that both sets of targets are related to major structural features related to a westward extension of the Curraghinalt lateral ramp which is widely regarded as a critical control on the location of the Curraghinalt deposit. The two prospectivity models were also applied to a sub-area of the terrane, the Newtownstewart map sheet, covering 560 km 2. This analysis incorporated structural vectors derived from a more detailed evaluation of the Tellus geophysical datasets and from the revised 1 : 50 000 scale geological map for the Newtownstewart sheet published in 2007 which incorporated modified linework based in part on examination of the Tellus data. Comparison of the results of the regional and detailed analyses shows that, in the detailed analysis, the addition of structural data in areas devoid of such information in the regional analysis has led to an increase in the size of the targets identified. The detailed analysis has also identified extensive additional target areas, including zones of very high prospectivity, in the south-eastern quarter of the map sheet. This study has clearly demonstrated the value of knowledge-based prospectivity analysis in the Dalradian terrane of north-western Northern Ireland. The regional Tellus geochemical and geophysical datasets are critical to the application of this methodology. Further improvement of the technique is possible through implementation of a range of measures. The potential benefits from the use of a sample catchment approach to the geochemical drainage data should be investigated. A more detailed and comprehensive database of bedrock mineral occurrences would help validation of the prospectivity results and would also potentially allow the use of data-driven methods of analysis, removing the subjectivity inherent in knowledge-based methods. Addition of further high-resolution datasets would improve the utility of this approach for follow-up exploration...|$|R
