40|$|Abstract: Independently of {{the choice}} of refrigerant, {{environmental}} and/or safety issues can be minimized by reducing leakage {{and the amount of}} refrigerant charge in heat pump or refrigeration systems, preferably both. In the investigation reported here, a laboratory test rig was built, simulating a water-to-water heat pump with a <b>heating</b> <b>capacity</b> of 5 <b>kW.</b> The system was designed to minimize the charge of refrigerant mainly by use of minichannel aluminium heat exchangers and a compact system design. It was shown that the system could be run with 200 g of propane at typical domestic heat pump operating conditions without reduction in the heating coefficient of performance (COP 1) compared with a traditional design. Additional charge reduction is possible by selecting proper compressor lubrication oils or by employing a compressor simply using less lubrication oil...|$|R

50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>capacity</b> is an {{extensive}} property of matter, {{meaning that it}} {{is proportional to the}} size of the system.

40|$|AbstractThe Micro {{gas turbine}} plant (MGTP) {{is used for}} the {{decentralized}} supply to the external electric power consumers. Its nominal and <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> are 100 <b>kW</b> and 200 kW respectively. Its critical part is a rotor with the operating speed of 65, 000 rpm. It consists of two subsystems: a turbocharger rotor (TCR) and a rotor of the starter-generator (SGR) connected by elastic coupling. One of the design requirements for the rotor is the absence of critical speed in the ± 30 % operating speed range. In this article the natural and the critical frequencies of the rotor are analyzed. Its natural frequencies evaluated for the whole rotor system and for each of the two subsystems individually. For the TCR such an assessment was obtained through the finite element method (FEM) calculation. Due to the complexity of the SGR design, its natural frequencies were estimated and proved experimentally using LMS modal analysis technology. Also a study of the influence of bearings stiffness on the natural frequencies of the rotor was conducted to identify its acceptable range. The study of the critical speeds of the MGTP rotor was performed in two stages by calculation: an analytical and numerical solution of the test problem obtained firstly in order to confirm the accuracy of FEM calculation in the Ansys Workbench package followed by the critical speeds evaluated through the FEM calculation on solid 3 D model. Based on the obtained results, some recommendations on the design of the rotor elements are given to ensure the natural frequencies are in the restrained region...|$|R

This amounted to a prediction that volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> in solids would be constant. In 1819 they found that volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>capacities</b> were not quite constant, but that the most constant quantity was the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of solids adjusted by the presumed weight of the atoms of the substance, as defined by Dalton (the Dulong-Petit law). This quantity was proportional to the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per atomic weight (or per molar mass), which suggested {{that it is the}} <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per atom (not per unit of volume) which is closest to being a constant in solids. Eventually (see the discussion in <b>heat</b> <b>capacity)</b> it became clear that <b>heat</b> <b>capacities</b> per particle for all substances in all states are the same, to within a factor of two, so long as temperatures are not in the cryogenic range.
