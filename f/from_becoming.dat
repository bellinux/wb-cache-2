5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> unstable at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.|$|E
5|$|Born in Nordhausen, Germany to John Wolfgang Horn and Sophia Dorothea Shenaman, Charles Frederick Horn was {{the third}} of their four children. According to the memoirs of Charles Frederick's son, Charles Edward Horn, John Wolfgang wished for his son to become a surveyor. Horn would often furtively {{practice}} music instead; when his father found out, he destroyed the family's clavichord {{in the hopes of}} preventing his son <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> distracted from his studies. This, though, did not dissuade Horn from taking music lessons from Nordhausen organist Christoph Gottlieb Schr√∂ter.|$|E

5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E
5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track to the northwest throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> a hurricane.|$|E

The following month, Edge and Orton became World Tag Team Champions, and Lita left the group after her legitimate retirement.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> extinct have had modest success. Pallid {{sturgeon}} are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|E
5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking {{to develop a}} silk industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> globally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> a haven for communism.|$|E
