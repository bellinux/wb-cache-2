25|$|There {{are quite}} a few players like me who did really well early in their careers, but didn't {{consolidate}} later on. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that sort of stuff.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Saddington {{provided}} three {{tracks for}} the album, Women 'n Blues, with other tracks by Kate Dunbar, Sally King, Jeannie Lewis and Margret RoadKnight.

6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she replied, {{with a faint}} note of truculence in her tone. [...] "You know I'm not {{short of}} money, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> where <b>I</b> should find you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{heard some}} one {{coming through the}} bushes," [...] replied Bob, as he began a {{vigorous}} attack on the food; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nothing but the wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're safe enough, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{a mighty}} neat job, Cerise, taken altogether, {{although}} the fools {{have been watching}} me night and day. That's the reason I did not come sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I am forgetting {{all about}} my brothers," [...] added Dick hastily. [...] "Let us leave this {{alone for the}} present. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> safe enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "as we'll {{probably}} be here {{a day or}} two, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I'll {{tell you about it}} when we get supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all {{straight}} enough. Aronson {{must know}} that he couldn't get any such money out of us unless everything was as straight as a string." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only one before," [...] {{said the}} boy. [...] "The last one, when his daughters went out. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> their coaxing got mother {{to let me}} go. My father {{was killed in the}} war." ...|$|R
6000|$|Torrance {{considered}} for a second, and then smiled significantly as {{he glanced at his}} daughter's face. [...] "Well, you would be 'most as safe down there--and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> born in you," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{them are}} in the workings, some of them on the range, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Vancouver the Fraser crowd started out. Seemed to me they meant to get there before they stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{a hundred}} miles, as the crow flies," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> longer by the railroad, and we'll have some climbing to do--to {{get into the}} Rockies." ...|$|E
6000|$|Or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the {{handkerchief}} of the Lord, [...] A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, [...] Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, {{that we may}} see [...] and remark, and say Whose? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Come on {{down and}} let us see how the engine works. We can do that easily enough, for it's a good deal like the engine of an auto, or a motor boat," [...] went on Tom.|$|E
5000|$|... "I had {{a natural}} proclivity {{to like the}} arts, {{although}} I did not know why. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my creative nature, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one thing I missed everywhere growing up because Medellin {{in those days was}} a very business-like, kind of pragmatic society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, gentlemen,' {{says the}} cigar man, 'I don't {{blame you for}} not wanting to play. I've {{forgotten}} the fine points of the game, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> so long since I indulged. Now, {{how long are you}} gentlemen {{going to be in the}} city?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I seem to {{recollect}} that I was mighty sleepy once. It {{comes back}} to me that I {{wanted to say something}} to the driver and that I couldn't make him heed me. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the heat, but I felt swimmy for a moment. That's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think it's funny,--don't you? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but what's {{going to}} become of me? That's what I want to know. I've been in trouble before, but never in any like this. And who got me into it? You!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time {{to start}} on the return, if you young ladies {{have got to be}} in by ten," [...] said Dick, at last. [...] "Even as it is I haven't allowed any time for {{punctures}} or breakdowns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I say," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "Mrs. Hummer sticks her bill {{right down}} their throats and then pumps {{up the food}} she has already swallowed. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a good thing that}} the babies have short bills." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was dumbfounded--this was {{my thanks}} for saving her from Jubal! I {{turned and looked}} at the corpse. [...] "May be that I saved you from a worse fate, old man," [...] I said, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lost on Dian, for she never seemed to notice it at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{strain of}} the journey on a played-out constitution, and, as I think I suggested, the effect of {{excitement}} on a diseased heart. The man was under a high tension the last day or two. It's a sure thing he had something on his mind. After all, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a delusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Got them all," [...] said Alton cheerfully. [...] "That {{last one}} {{was just on}} the edge, and it took some {{thinking}} before I could get at <b>it.</b> Still, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> some kind of dress stuff for the girl, and if we lost <b>it</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> a long while before she got another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{going to}} rain, so I {{shall have to}} go any way," [...] {{answered}} Bab, {{taking advantage of the}} black clouds rolling up the sky, for she scorned to own that she was afraid of any thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} that I haven't thanked you," [...] said Dusky. [...] "I knew there was {{something}} wrong over here, but I didn't know what. So it was a hunter. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good thing that I heeded your warn-ing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Snag! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a snag. It bids fair to {{make all}} our labor and {{millions}} of dollars--wasted.... But I'm {{not asking you to}} come back just to help us over this snag. I mean will you come back for good--and stick?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 50 Cent told NME {{that the}} song was the first he remembered hearing: [...] "I've always loved MJ, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} {{a good place to}} start music: right here, with the ABCs." [...] On 27 November 2016, the Grammy Hall of Fame announced its induction, along with that of another 24 songs.|$|R
50|$|It's {{so hard to}} figure. We went in confident. We {{really thought}} we'd win and win handily. Something happened, though, during the week. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that week. The week has its own momentum, like nothing we'd been in before...Shula said we'd been embarrassed. He said we didn't even compete....That's the sickest feeling I've ever had.|$|R
6000|$|Colohan strode close, big and formidable. [...] "If {{you mean}} me, you're a liar," [...] he declared. [...] "An' don't say it!" [...] Coffee was plainly intimidated, and Colohan turned to Neale. [...] "Boss, I swear I wasn't {{in on this}} deal. Lately <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all wrong. But all I could do was obey orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|Or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a uniform}} hieroglyphic, [...] And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, [...] Growing among black folks as among white, [...] Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I {{give them the}} same, I [...] receive them the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see that}} bit of black rock {{cropping}} out of the hill-side. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about {{two hundred and fifty}} yards away, and is about the size a red-skin's head would be if he were crawling through the grass towards us. Will you shoot first or shall I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, on my saul. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> some law phrase; but sue a beggar, and--your honour {{knows what}} follows. Well, but I {{will be just}} with you, and if bow and brach fail not, you shall {{have a piece of}} game two fingers fat on the brisket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she exclaimed, {{with her}} usual enthusiasm, seizing Rachel by the arm, [...] "I call this splendid! <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to happen}} from the very beginning!

6000|$|... "Oh yes. Left my {{mechanic}} in charge. Why, I {{just kind}} of decided suddenly. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what they call an inspiration. Always wanted a long trip, anyway, and I thought maybe in Seattle I could hook up with something a little peppier than Schoenstrom. Maybe something in Alaska. Always wished I were a mechanical or civil engineer so----" ...|$|R
