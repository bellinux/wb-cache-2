5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|Barton Academy is a {{historic}} Greek Revival school building and local landmark on Government Street. The Bishop Portier House and the Carlen House {{are two of the}} many surviving examples of Creole cottages in the city. The Mobile City Hospital and the United States Marine Hospital are both restored Greek Revival hospital buildings that predate the Civil War. The Washington Firehouse No. 5 is a Greek Revival fire station, built in 1851. The Hunter House {{is an example of the}} Italianate style and was built by a successful 19th-century African American businesswoman. The Shepard House is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen Anne style. The Scottish Rite Temple is the only surviving example of Egyptian Revival architecture in the city. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal is an example of the Mission Revival style.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in 2005, Titan Quest received generally positive reviews when released, being both praised as a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genre {{while at the}} same time being criticized for its traditional gameplay. Sales of the main game and its expansion have been estimated as approaching one million units. The mobile port was tricky for its developers due to adapting the game for touchscreen controls: like the console version, it received positive reviews upon release. The engine and gameplay of Titan Quest later became the foundation for Grim Dawn, a video game developed by team members from Iron Lore following the studio's closure. In 2016, an improved and expanded Anniversary Edition was released and received very positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 {{the total population of}} the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E

5|$|The monks of Winchester {{had already}} elected {{one of their}} own number, but this was over-ruled, and Edington was consecrated in 1346. As a bishop he was {{necessarily}} much absent, even with the relatively short distance between Westminster and Winchester. He was not entirely detached from his episcopal duties, however: he used the see as a source for extensive nepotism, yet he also initiated wide-ranging building works on the nave of the cathedral. Meanwhile, in 1351, he founded an Augustinian priory at his birthplace of Edington, to have prayers said for himself, his parents and his brother. Although most of the priory has been demolished, the church still stands, as a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transition between the decorated and perpendicular style of church-building.|$|E

25|$|In addition, Euler's {{recognition}} that the key information {{was the number of}} bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology.

As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide a good sources and sinks for the sediment budget.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{models and}} {{computer}} models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models {{can be used}} by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although haptic devices have occasionally been built). On a computer screen, the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the pseudorotation of cyclohexane is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of mechanical models.|$|E
25|$|The Union House, {{along with}} being the first brick house built in Orangeville, is the only example of Gothic Revival {{architecture}} found in the village. It is important locally because it was constructed by the village founder, John Bower. The house is also a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossover from Greek to Gothic Revival and blends elements from both style. The house's local significance, combined with its architectural importance qualified it for listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 2000.|$|E

50|$|The brief was {{to design}} an Elizabethan style house, with Jacobean overtones. Its lofty gables, cupolas, 48 {{chimneys}} and mullioned windows are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period style. Two large weather vanes were designed, overlooking the halls’ turrets, in <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters M and I, for Meynell Ingram.|$|R
25|$|A {{certain number}} of seats used for {{domestic}} purposes are of great interest. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a V tool; {{and of course the}} whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.|$|E
25|$|A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's {{history and}} {{interesting}} past {{can be seen}} in the main square, where the Gazi Kasim Mosque still stands, and, although consecrated as a church following the retreat of the Ottoman Turks centuries ago, the crescent moon and cross of Islam are still visible on the cupola. Indeed, Pécs is the richest town in Hungary in terms of Turkish architecture, with the ruins of Memi Pasa's Baths and the mausoleum of miracle worker Idris Baba, just two other notable remains.|$|E
25|$|Although {{of smaller}} {{dimensions}} then the southern doorway, {{this is the}} most important door to the Jerónimos because of its ornamentation and its position in front of the main altar. This western portal is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transition from the Gothic style to Renaissance. It was built by Nicolau Chanterene in 1517. This was probably his first commission in Portugal. It is now spanned by a vestibule, added in the 19th century, that forms a transition between the church and the ambulatory.|$|E
