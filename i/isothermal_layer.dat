Then Masuzawa introduced the subtropical mode water concept to describe the thick layer of temperature 16-18 °C in the northwestern North Pacific subtropical gyre, on the southern side of the Kuroshio Extension. The terminology mode water was extended to the thick near-surface layer north of the Subantarctic Front by McCartney, who identified and mapped the properties of the Subantarctic mode water (SAMW). After that, McCartney and Talley then applied the term subpolar mode water (SPMW) to the thick near-surface mixed layers in the North Atlantic’s subpolar gyre.|$|E

40|$|Passing {{over the}} ocean surface, typhoon absorbs heat from the sea water as it needs the heat as its ‘fuel’. The process is via {{evaporation}} of water. Subsequently, the sea surface temperature (SST) in that area will significantly decrease. Due to strong typhoon wind water is evaporated from the surface layer of the ocean, {{the amount of water}} mass in that area is lost, but the same amount of salt will remain, causing sea surface salinity (SSS) to increase. Strong winds induced by typhoons will also cause turbulence in the water, causing entrainment, where cold deeper water is brought up to the surface layer of the ocean, which will consequently increase its SSS and change the <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> and mixed layer depth (MLD). Here, <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> means the ocean layer where temperature is almost constant and MLD is the depth where salinity is almost constant. This paper focuses on the effect of typhoons on SST, SSS, <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> and MLD by taking 15 typhoons in the Northwest Pacific throughout 2009 typhoon season (typhoons Lupit and Ketsana are used as examples in results) into consideration. Temperature and salinity data from selected Array of Regional Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) floats close to the individual typhoon’s track are used in this study.

Microfiche. xvii, 190 leaves, bound 29 cmProcesses which {{control the}} upper ocean thermohaline {{structure}} in the western equatorial Pacific are examined using the available hydrographic data, surface forcing data and a simple mixed layer model. A thick <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> is frequently found {{in the region of}} the South Equatorial Current. Analyses of surface forcing data have indicated that the thick <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> in the western equatorial Pacific is found during periods of light precipitation, strong winds and downward Ekman pumping in the central Pacific. These results are consistent with the subduction mechanism hypothesized by Lukas and Lindstrom (1991). A Lagrangian mixed layer model is used to investigate the hypothesis. The one-dimensional bulk mixed layer model is integrated along the trajectories derived from a non-linear 1 - 1 / 2 layer reduced gravity model forced with actual wind fields. This simple model is able to simulate the <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> and its variation. The subduction mechanism is evident in the model results. During the period of strong South Equatorial Current, the warm and salty mixed layer waters in the central Pacific are subducted below the fresh shallow mixed layer in the western Pacific.

For vertical fields, magnetic structures of super-equipartition strengths are formed because such fields survive downward advection, unlike NEMPI under horizontal magnetic fields. The horizontal cross-section of such structures is approximately circular. Results based on isothermal models can be applied locally to polytropic layers. For vertical fields, magnetic flux concentrations of super-equipartition strengths form, which supports suggestions that sunspot formation might be a shallow phenomenon.

Results reveal that <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> (IL) deepening and <b>isothermal</b> <b>layer</b> (IL) cooling with evident rightward biases induced by strong TCs are clearer compared to the weak TCs. Likewise, the rightward biases of IL deepening and cooling induced by fast TCs are more obvious than that induced by slow TCs. The upwelling within TC’s eye is much stronger for the strong (slow) TCs than weak (fast) TCs. For the strong and slow TCs, the TC-induced rainfall reduces deepening of constant density layer (with its depth called the mixed layer depth, MLD), and in turn increases the barrier layer thickness (BLT). The initial BL prior to TC can restrict IL cooling more markedly under the weak and fast TCs than under the strong and slow TCs. The inertial oscillation is stronger induced by the strong (fast) TCs than by the weak (slow) TCs. In addition, the most pronounced TC-induced mixed layer deepening and IL cooling in July to October climatology occur in the subtropical gyre of the northwest Pacific with enhanced vertical diffusivity.

40|$|One {{widely used}} {{technique}} {{for the construction}} of equilibrium models of stellar disks is based on the Jeans equations and the moments of velocity distribution functions derived using these equations. Stellar disks constructed using this technique are shown to be "not entirely" in equilibrium. Our attempt to abandon the epicyclic approximation and the approximation of infinite <b>isothermal</b> <b>layers,</b> which are commonly adopted in this technique, failed to improve the situation substantially. We conclude that the main drawback of techniques based on the Jeans equations is that the system of equations employed is not closed, and therefore requires adopting an essentially ad hoc additional closure condition. A new iterative approach to constructing equilibrium N-body models with a given density distribution is proposed. The main idea behind this approach is that a model is first constructed using some approximation method, and is then allowed to adjust to an equilibrium state with the specified density and the required parameters of the velocity distribution remaining fixed in the process. This iterative approach was used to construct isotropic, spherically symmetric models and models of stellar disks embedded in an external potential. The numerical models constructed prove to be close to equilibrium. It is shown that the commonly adopted assumption that the profile of the radial velocity dispersion is exponential may be wrong.

40|$|High-resolution hydrographic {{observations}} of temperature and salinity {{are used to}} analyze the formation and distribution of isothermal depth (ZT), mixed depth (ZM) and barrier layer thickness (BLT) in a section of the southwestern Atlantic (0 ° 30 ´ N– 14 ° 00 ´ S; 31 ° 24 ´– 41 ° 48 ´ W), adjacent to the northeastern Brazilian coast. Analyzed data consists of 279 CTD casts acquired during two cruises under the Brazilian REVIZEE Program. One occurred in late austral winter (August–October 1995) and another in austral summer (January–April 1997). Oceanic observations are compared to numerical modeling results obtained from the French Mercator-Coriolis Program. Results indicate that the intrusion of subtropical Salinity Maximum Waters (SMW) is the major process contributing to the seasonal barrier layer formation. These waters are brought by the South Equatorial Current (SEC), from the subtropical region, into the western tropical Atlantic boundary. During late austral winter southeastern trade winds are more intense and ITCZ precipitations induce lower surface salinity values near the equator. During this period a 5 – 90 m thick BLT (median = 15 m) is observed and BLT > 30 m is restricted to latitudes higher than 8 ° S, where the intrusion of salty waters between 8 °– 12. 3 ° S creates shallow mixed layers over deep (ZT ≥ 90 m) <b>isothermal</b> <b>layers.</b> During austral summer, shallow <b>isothermal</b> and mixed <b>layers</b> prevail, when northeasterly winds are predominant and evaporation overcomes precipitation, causing saltier waters at the surface/subsurface layers. During that period observed BLT varies from 5 to 70 m and presents thicker median value of 35 m, when comparing to the winter. Furthermore, BLT ≥ 30 m is observed not only in the southernmost part of the study area, as verified during late winter, but in the latitude range 2 °– 14 ° S, where near-surface salty waters are transported westward by the SEC flow. These results indicate that the inclusion of salinity dynamics and its variability are necessary for studying mixed and barrier layer behaviors in the tropical Atlantic, where ocean-atmosphere coupling is known to be stronger...|$|R
