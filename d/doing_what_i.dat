25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|In early 1865, {{at the age}} of 13, Edgardo {{became a}} novice in the Canons Regular of the Lateran, adding the Pope's name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote {{repeatedly}} to his family, he recalled, [...] "dealing with religion and <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could to convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith," [...] but received no reply until May 1867—his parents, who were now living in Florence, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Italian troops captured the city on 20 September 1870.|$|E

It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ...

[...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys.

The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that.

I am all about <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel is right. It {{is not easy to}} pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." [...] Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it [...] "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner."

500|$|Whitney {{was portrayed}} by Brook Kerr from the series' debut on July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007. In 2005, Sidne Siobhan Phillips portrayed the {{character}} in flashbacks. Passions casting director Jacklynn Briskey originally rejected 26-year-old Brook Kerr {{for the role}} of Whitney, believing she would look too mature to play a teenager. Despite this decision, Kerr's husband Christopher Warren submitted his wife's head shots to the network and she was hired to play the character. Kerr later described the week of auditioning and two screen tests to be formally cast in the role as an extremely quick process. While discussing her portrayal of the character, Kerr said, [...] "I was always the sensible one, the friend everyone could count on, always <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should." [...] Over the course of the series, media outlets frequently speculated on the exact nature of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The incest storyline led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where [...] "half-siblings sleep with one another." [...] Soap Opera Digest listed the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood as one of Passions most shocking secrets.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being".

[...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record.

500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was asking.

[...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E
