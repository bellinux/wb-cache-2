40|$|In {{this study}} <b>heated</b> <b>food</b> was {{collected}} in kitchens on battalion’s level to verify whether the kitchen teams {{comply with the}} accurate procedures written in the regulations. Based on these baseline data {{it would be possible}} to take corrective actions where necessary and to educate the kitchen team. In the months of September and October 2015 ten battalions with a total of 35 kitchens at 36 different locations were sampled over a period of one week. The samples (n= 480) were analyzed with cultural standard methods for the parameters: total aerobic mesophilic viable counts, Enterobacteriaceae, B. cereus, coagulase positive Staphylococci and C. perfringens. In general, the results suggest a good microbiological quality of <b>heated</b> <b>food</b> produced in these kitchens. However, some kitchens and some products, for example mashed potatoes (B. cereus), showed striking results. Such data are important for building up a risk-based microbiological monitoring system. Moreover, the detection of B. cereus in 5 % of the 480 <b>heated</b> <b>food</b> samples highlights the importance of cooling the pre-produced <b>heated</b> <b>food</b> as fast as possible and to keep it refrigerated. Otherwise, the heated products have to be stored before serving at enough high temperature (≥ 65 °C) to prevent multiplication of B. cereus. This study points a benefit out of such microbiological examinations. Therefore, a risk-based implementation of product examinations within the self-control system of the Swiss army kitchens should be pursued...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Supermarkets play a {{major role}} in {{influencing}} the food purchasing behaviours of most households. Snack food exposures within these stores may contribute to higher levels of consumption and ultimately to increasing levels of obesity, particularly within socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We aimed to examine the availability of snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> at checkouts, end-of-aisle displays and island displays in major supermarket chains in the least and most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Melbourne. Methods Within-store audits of 35 Melbourne supermarkets. Supermarkets were sampled from the least and most socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs within 30 km of the Melbourne CBD. We measured the availability of crisps, chocolate, confectionery, and soft drinks (diet and regular) at the checkouts, in end-of-aisle displays, and in island bin <b>displays.</b> Results Snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> were most prominent at checkouts with only five stores not having snack foods at 100 % of their checkouts. Snack foods were also present at a number of end-of-aisle displays (at both the front (median 38 %) and back (median 33 %) of store), and in island bin displays (median number of island displays: 7; median total circumference of island displays: 19. 4 metres). Chocolate items were the most common snack <b>food</b> item on <b>display.</b> There was no difference in the availability of these snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> by neighbourhood disadvantage. Conclusions As a result of the high availability of snack <b>food</b> <b>displays,</b> exposure to snack foods is almost unavoidable in Melbourne supermarkets, regardless of levels of neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage. Results of this study could promote awareness of the prominence of unhealthy food items in chain-brand supermarkets outlets. </p...|$|R

50|$|Modern kitchen stoves may use {{alternative}} methods for <b>heating</b> <b>food.</b> Natural gas and electric stoves {{are the most}} common today in western countries. Both are equally effective and safe, and the choice between the two is largely a matter of personal preference and pre-existing utility outlets: if a house has no gas supply, adding one {{just to be able to}} run a gas stove is an expensive endeavor. In particular, professional chefs often prefer gas stovetops, for they allow them to control the heat more finely and more quickly. On the other hand, some chefs often prefer electric stoves because they tend to <b>heat</b> <b>food</b> more evenly. Today's major brands offer both gas and electric stoves, and many also offer dual-fuel stoves combining gas and electric stovetops.|$|R
50|$|Microwave {{frequencies}} penetrate conductive materials, including semi-solid substances like {{meat and}} living tissue, to a distance {{defined by the}} skin effect. The penetration essentially stops where all the penetrating microwave energy has been converted to heat in the tissue. Microwave ovens used to <b>heat</b> <b>food</b> are not set to the frequency for optimal absorption by water. If that was so, then the piece of food or liquid in question would absorb all microwave radiation in its outer layer, leading to a cool, unheated centre and a superheated surface. Instead, the frequency selected allows energy to penetrate deeper into the <b>heated</b> <b>food.</b> The frequency of a household microwave oven is 2.45 GHz, while the frequency for optimal absorbency by water is around 10 GHz.|$|R

5000|$|A {{microwave}} oven (commonly {{referred to as}} a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that <b>heats</b> and cooks <b>food</b> by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range.

Microwave ovens <b>heat</b> <b>foods</b> quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25-38 mm (1-1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.|$|R

40|$|In 2002 Swedish {{researchers}} {{announced that}} exposure of humans to the suspected carcinogen acrylamide can come {{also from the}} diet, in particular from eating starch-rich foods subjected to intense heating (Tareke et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., 50, 4998 - 5006, 2002). Maillard-type reactions, which need the presence of asparagine, have been shown as one major reaction pathways of acrylamide formation (Mottram et al., Nature, 419, 448 - 449, 2002; Stadler et al., Nature, 419, 449 - 450, 2002; Biedermann et al., Mitt. Lebensmittelunter. Hyg., 93, 653 - 667, 2002; Becalski et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., 52, 3801 - 3806, 2003; Zyzak et al., J. Agric. Food Chem, 51, 4782 - 4787, 2003). As a consequence, acrylamide formation {{has been found to}} be closely related to the development of the desired sensory properties (colour, flavour, texture) of <b>heated</b> <b>foods,</b> which are due to the development of the Maillard reaction products. Thus, the reduction of acrylamide formation in foods represents a big challenge for food technologists, since the technological interventions to this purpose should lead to the production of foods low in acrylamide and high in sensory properties. Here we discuss two different technological approaches aimed to reduce acrylamide concentration in <b>heated</b> <b>foods</b> with minimal impact on their sensory properties and possibly compatible with the existing industrial manufacturing process. The first is relevant to the mitigation of acrylamide formation by means of pre-treatments or processing interventions. The second is a patented technological strategy based on the removal of acrylamide from the <b>heated</b> <b>foods</b> under specific “ambient” conditions...|$|R
