Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

5|$|Square Enix is a Japanese {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher formed from the merger on April 1, 2003 of video game developer Square and publisher Enix. The company {{is best known}} for its role-playing video game franchises, which include the Final Fantasy series, the Dragon Quest series, and the action-RPG Kingdom Hearts series. For many of its games, Square Enix has produced albums of music containing songs from those <b>games</b> <b>or</b> arrangements of those songs. In addition to those albums, it has produced several compilation albums containing music from multiple <b>games</b> <b>or</b> series made by the company. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles, such as orchestral, piano, vocal, and techno. This list includes albums produced by Square, Enix, or Square Enix which contain music from multiple games in the companies' catalog which are not a part of a single series. The first of these was Personal Computer Music by Enix in 1987. Dozens of albums have been published since, primarily through Square Enix's own record label.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} {{allegation}} that some poll voters simply look at box scores before punching in their votes. When the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) existed in college football, the votes had {{a huge impact on}} who went to BCS games, including the national championship. Only by watching the <b>game</b> <b>or</b> <b>game</b> tape (<b>or</b> by careful box-score scrutiny) can a coach determine if a 49-21 score was caused by a fairly one-sided <b>game</b> <b>or</b> the winning team trying to make the score look more impressive when the game's outcome was certain.|$|R
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough <b>games</b> <b>or</b> activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E

Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are.
