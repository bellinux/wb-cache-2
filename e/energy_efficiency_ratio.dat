25|$|HVAC use of {{a cooling}} tower pairs the cooling tower with a {{water-cooled}} chiller or water-cooled condenser. A ton of air-conditioning {{is defined as the}} removal of 12,000 BTU/hour (3500 W). The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10°F (6°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0.

2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting.

Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation.

Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E

The national standard, GB 19577 - 2004, which sets the grade and scale of water chiller <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> has been implemented for five years and has produced achievements in energy-saving and emission reduction, which is a basic state policy in China. This paper presents extensive investigations on water chiller <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> conducted in 2009 and compares these results with results from 2003. This analysis shows that the average <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> level in 2009 was higher than in 2003.

The standard should be upgraded every five years. Therefore, this paper proposes a draft of a new <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> standard. In the draft, thermodynamic perfectibility [eta] is presented to be used as an indicator instead of the EER; for [eta], 0. 4 is the minimum allowable value and 0. 6 is the maximum value.

This paper reviews national standards and guidelines for the energy performance of chiller systems which provide cooling energy in commercial buildings but their operation causes the major proportion of electricity consumption in the building sector. The standards reviewed are currently adopted in nine places (in alphabetical order) : Australia, California, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the USA. Under standard rating conditions at full load operation, the minimum required coefficient of performance (COP) ranges from 2. 40 to 3. 06 for air-cooled chillers and from 3. 80 to 6. 39 for water-cooled chillers. Some standards state also the COP requirements at part load operation with integrated part load values or seasonal <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios.</b> A classification scheme is provided in the EU and Chinese standards which helps labeling and certifying high efficient chiller products.

Instead, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EER) has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems.

Triplicate groups of sibling triploids and diploids (45. g initial weight) were fed isocaloric diets with 0. 76, 0. 99 and 1. 39 % total phosphorus in a 12 -week growth trial, followed by a feed digestibility trial with diets having 0. 67, 0. 93 and 1. 15 % total phosphorus. Triploids had a higher growth rate and lower condition factor than diploids during the growth trial, with no difference in feed conversion ratio. Whole-body lipid and energy levels, as well as nitrogen and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios,</b> were higher in the triploids, but ash and moisture levels were lower.
