5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E

Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> real meaning.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk. There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
25|$|Though {{imprisoned in}} February 1919 by the {{government}} of Mihály Károlyi, Kun was allowed to continue directing the Hungarian Communist Party from his cell. The Social Democrats first approached Kun on the subject of a coalition government. Such was the desperation <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Kun receive promised Soviet support that it was Kun, a captive, who decided the terms to his captors. This was despite the Red Army's full involvement in the Russian Civil War and the unlikelihood that it could be of any direct military assistance.|$|E
25|$|An {{order for}} a third batch of 13 SD70ACe/LCi's (4334-4346) was placed in August 2007, but such was the demand for {{locomotive}} power in the Pilbara region, a deal was done with BNSF Railway for BHP Billiton to purchase ten standard North American SD70ACes (4324-4333) that were in build as their 9166, 9167, 9184-9191. Construction was sufficiently advanced when the deal was concluded <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been painted, hence they were delivered in BNSF orange livery.

25|$|Several {{apocryphal}} {{accounts of}} transplants exist well {{prior to the}} scientific understanding and advancements that would be necessary <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> actually occurred. The Chinese physician Pien Chi'ao reportedly exchanged hearts between a man of strong spirit but weak will with one of a man of weak spirit but strong will {{in an attempt to}} achieve balance in each man. Roman Catholic accounts report the 3rd-century saints Damian and Cosmas as replacing the gangrenous or cancerous leg of the Roman deacon Justinian with the leg of a recently deceased Ethiopian. Most accounts have the saints performing the transplant in the 4th century, many decades after their deaths; some accounts have them only instructing living surgeons who performed the procedure.|$|E
25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it is <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, {{one of the}} family members who lived in Texas, and told him that his remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could only pay a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E
500|$|In his {{preview of}} the final, John Woodcock, the cricket {{correspondent}} for The Times rated Somerset as the favourites. He cited the talent of Richards as their primary asset, but asserted that they were [...] "not a one man side". He noted that Sussex also relied upon their overseas players, Javed Miandad and Imran Khan, but that {{they would need to}} be backed up by Sussex's other players <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance of victory. The match was played at Lord's in London, as had every previous final of the competition, and play began at 10:30, with a lunch break scheduled for 12:45 to 13:25, and a 15-minute tea interval after 25 overs of the second innings.|$|E
500|$|The birds may {{be found}} in a variety of {{habitats}} including grassy woodland, riparian forest, heathland, subalpine areas, pine plantations, and occasionally in urban areas, {{as long as there is}} a plentiful food supply. They have also spread to parts of suburban Sydney, particularly on or near golf courses, pine plantations and parks, such as Centennial Park in the eastern suburbs. It is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere. In urban Melbourne, they have been recorded at Yarra Bend Park. The so-called [...] "Black Saturday bushfires" [...] in 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been sighted in other parts if the urban areas of Melbourne as well.|$|E

The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory, enough <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking [...] notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could hear what they were saying, and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks.|$|E
500|$|Ultra-light carbon {{nanotubes}} meshed through molecular manufacturing {{techniques have}} densities between 1.3 g/m2 to 1.4 g/m2. By {{the time a}} civilization is ready to use this technology, the carbon nanotube's manufacturing might be optimised enough <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m2, and the average sail density with rigging might be kept to 0.3 g/m2 (a [...] "spin stabilized" [...] light sail requires minimal additional mass in rigging). If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density, a space habitat {{the size of the}} L5 Society's proposed O'Neill cylinder—500km2, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3 tons—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4 kg. For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.|$|E
500|$|John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he {{developed}} his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported {{the views of}} the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the Irenaean theodicy seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them. Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render [...] "a Christian theodicy impossible". The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.|$|E

500|$|After {{stuffing}} {{themselves with}} turkey on Thanksgiving, {{it is time}} to take the annual Christmas card family photo, and when Bart and Lisa complain about it, Marge notes that they will grow to appreciate the photos when they become older and have children of their own. Lisa questions why Marge would assume they will even have children in the first place, and the episode jumps thirty years into the future via a series of Simpsons Christmas cards. The photos finally settle on a future where Bart is a deadbeat, divorced father with two sons whom he does not see often; Lisa is a successful businesswoman who is married to Milhouse and has a rebellious daughter named Zia; and Maggie is the lead singer of a famous band and in the late stages of pregnancy. In his apartment at the former Springfield Elementary, Bart is visited by his sons, who inform him that their mother Jenda teleported them to his place because she wants him to act like a proper father by having him spend time with them. However, he plans on dropping them off at his parents' house instead.
