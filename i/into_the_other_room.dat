5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> as if I was in a tractor beam and stood {{there in front of}} the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
60|$|ATHENE. Mother dear, {{will you}} go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> with Guy? [She points to the door Right].|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was high}} when Steve woke. He rose stiffly and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> William Bannister still slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{what the}} devil can have become of that butler? I never allow a servant to--Oh, {{confound}} that idiot, he's got the keys. Can't get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> without <b>the</b> keys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no one," [...] began Imogene. She glanced about her, frightened. They stood quite alone {{where they}} were; {{the people had}} mostly wandered off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> [...] "Oh, don't--I didn't mean--I didn't intend to say anything----" ...|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the main}} entrance, a paired Dutch door with {{original}} hardware, {{is a large}} main room with a smaller kitchen and dining room. The main room has beaded chair rail and baseboard and windows with original camlocks. Two original paneled doors with thumb latches lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> All are finished with the original 7 to 9 in tongue and groove pine flooring and wall and ceiling plaster. The dining room floor has a tin strip patch.|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. No: I'll be back presently. Only for a moment. [She goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> Praed {{opening the}} door for her].|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would if}} you didn't hide {{yourself}} away. Are you not going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> {{to hear the}} speech? Everything is prepared." ...|$|E
60|$|Anna {{set down}} the telephone. The listlessness had gone from her manner. She {{glanced at the clock}} and ran lightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Opposite {{the door}} of the hall there was a large open {{fireplace}} without a grate. Doors all round the walls of <b>the</b> hall opened <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> establishment. Above what would have been the mantelpiece, had one existed, there was a row of tobacco pipes. Old Duncan was a great smoker. Indeed he would have been almost unrecognisable without his pipe. He was smoking when Daniel Davidson visited him, in order to hold the very important conversation to which we have referred.|$|R
60|$|We looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> little <b>room,</b> {{and came}} back to Mrs. Gummidge, sitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the chimney-piece, {{requested}} to rise, that he might carry it outside the door before extinguishing the candle.|$|R
6000|$|Retracing our steps, we {{came again}} {{to the front of}} the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were {{admitted}} by the agents in charge. We went up stairs--into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the [...] "Gazette des Tribunaux." [...] Dupin scrutinized every thing--not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms,</b> and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a miserable}} meal, {{and they were}} all glad when it was finished. Maude drew Frank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> before he started.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can retire now," [...] Tippoo said, as {{he moved}} towards the door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Be faithful, be discreet, and your fortune is assured." ...|$|E
60|$|As to Mara and Sally, {{they were}} reveling in apronfuls of shells and seaweed, which they bustled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> to bestow in their spacious baby-house.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} cases where apports have been smuggled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> s√©ance <b>room.</b> <b>Other</b> apport mediums that were exposed as frauds were Lajos Pap and Maria Silbert.|$|R
5000|$|My {{memories}} {{of it were}} still very {{much as it was}} when we'd played there originally. It wasn't really being used back then, but the same family still own it. The lady who rented it to Zeppelin I think had passed on, but I think her granddaughter lives there now. My {{memories of}} it were really as it was in those old days with the heating not working and it being very damp, but it was still the scene of some very high-energy playing ... the film I was quite overwhelmed when I went in, {{not only because of the}} past but also because now it was a house and I was poking around in a house that was a home. There was furniture, ornaments, pictures and even some musical instruments ... The dimensions of the hall were still as I remembered it. I also went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms,</b> including room I slept in and where the fire was where we used to keep warm and it was quite overwhelming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keys {{are easily}} lost," [...] said Caroline, [...] "but my {{davenport}} is very important. Perhaps in some cleaning {{it has been}} moved <b>into</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> and forgotten there. I wish you would look. You know I had it before I came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he alive?" [...] whispered Jenny, so much {{overcome}} that Julius {{had to hold}} her up {{for a moment as}} he led her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|They were {{speaking}} in whispered tones. Through the open doors {{they could see}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> Mrs. Phillips, under Airlie's instructions, was venturing upon a cigarette.|$|E
60|$|The {{man did not}} answer. He gave a deep, long-drawn sigh, leaned {{and kissed}} her on the forehead, stepped back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> and closed the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. They will {{be passing}} {{backwards}} and forwards." [...] Lady Alexandrina said nothing further, but led <b>the</b> way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> large <b>room.</b> That also was lighted, {{and there were}} in it four or live persons. Lady Rosina was reading a work on the Millennium, with a light to herself in one corner. Her brother John was asleep in an arm-chair, and a young gentleman and lady were playing chess. There was, however, ample room for Crosbie and Alexandrina {{to take up a}} position apart.|$|R
60|$|I noticed {{during the}} period of this new {{persecution}} that the beasts appeared only when our backs were turned; we never saw one really materialize from thin air, nor did I for an instant sufficiently lose my excellent reasoning faculties to be once deluded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> belief that <b>the</b> beasts came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>other</b> than through some concealed and well-contrived doorway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stella," [...] she said, [...] "you {{know what}} sort of a man your father is. If he learns {{that you have been}} here in this room, he will never forgive me. He will send me home, and that would be hateful, for many, many reasons. Do please be reasonable, and come away with me now <b>into</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> I will do all that I can to bring you two together." ...|$|R
60|$|She passed {{quickly and}} noiselessly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> and {{returned}} with the heavy leather valise, which she handed to the American {{with an air of}} patient contempt.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> {{returning}} {{in a few}} moments with a work basket, from which she drew a soiled and unfinished piece of embroidery.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{will they}} do next, I wonder?" [...] Dick Caister said as, leaving the two hands to guard the window, he {{returned}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> with Reuben.|$|E
60|$|ARTHUR {{had chosen}} the entrance-hall for the ballroom: very wisely, for no <b>other</b> <b>room</b> could have been so airy, or {{would have had the}} {{advantage}} of the wide doors opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden, as well as a ready entrance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> To be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on, but then, most of the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries. It was one of those entrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms look like closets--with stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty ceiling, and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating with statues in niches. Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with green boughs, and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his hothouse plants on the occasion. The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children, who were to stay till half-past nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing, and as this dance was confined to the chief tenants, there was abundant room for every one. The lights were charmingly disposed in coloured-paper lamps, high up among green boughs, and the farmers' wives and daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be more splendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and queen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins and acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how things went on in the great world. The lamps were already lit, though the sun had not long set, and there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} a good deal," [...] he said, [...] "for two bourgeois jerkins, even were they as foul {{as those of the}} skinners. This is a woman's apartment," [...] he added, looking round, [...] "and nothing here will cover my six feet of height, to say nothing of your four inches extra. Let us peep <b>into</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> This is, doubtless, the house of some person of importance, and in the upper floor we may find some clothes of {{servants}} or retainers." ...|$|R
50|$|The ceiling {{painting}} on the higher circuit of the room {{is the work of}} Thomas Huber, dating from 1756. Huber also painted the ceilings of the empty chambers on the exterior surface. The plans of the French artist Blaise Nicholas Le Sueur, who taught as an art master at the Berlin Academy of Arts, served {{as a model for the}} interior. The ceiling paintings show Oriental men behind a balustrade, some looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>others</b> chatting with one another. They are surrounded by parrots, monkeys and Buddhas sitting on posts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My cousin is a despot,' said Mark, moving off, {{with a bow}} to Theodora; Mrs. Finch, following, spoke a few words, {{and then}} shut him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is that {{tall man}} with her?" [...] {{continued}} the old lady as Wetzel did not answer. [...] "There, they have gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> Who is he?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{as though}} with the tears he had purged himself of weakness, he got up, locked the box, and slowly, almost trembling, carried {{it with him}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nell {{accompanied}} him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> little <b>rooms,</b> and over both the houses, {{in which he}} found various small comforts wanting, which he engaged to supply from a certain collection of odds and ends he had at home, and which {{must have been a}} very miscellaneous and extensive one, as it comprehended the most opposite articles imaginable. They all came, however, and came without loss of time; for the little old gentleman, disappearing for some five or ten minutes, presently returned, laden with old shelves, rugs, blankets, and other household gear, and followed by a boy bearing a similar load. These being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap, yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging, erecting, and putting away; the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight, and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity. When nothing more was left to be done, he charged the boy to run off and bring his schoolmates to be marshalled before their new master, and solemnly reviewed.|$|R
50|$|Citadel further {{improved}} the user {{experience in the}} area of command and control. Based on Alan Kay‚Äôs philosophy of user-interface design, ‚ÄúSimple things should be simple; complex things should be possible,‚Äù and influenced by the fact that Citadel was developed in an era of 300 baud modems, the basic and most heavily used commands are accessed via single keystrokes. The most common commands are <G>oto (the next room with new messages), <N>ew messages (display the New messages in the room to the user), and <E>nter a message <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>Other</b> single keystroke commands exist as well, such as <K>nown rooms, which lists the rooms known to the user.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kent, {{order the}} {{women out of}} <b>the</b> zenana <b>into</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> Tell them that they will all be searched as they come out, and that if one brings out an {{ornament}} or a jewel with her she {{will be put to}} death. Of course you will not search them; but the threat will do. Let no insult be offered them. Then let Rivers take four men, and go in, and take all the loot you can find. The jewels we will divide among the men when at Meerut. Tell off another party to loot the rest of the rooms, but only take what is really valuable and portable. We cannot cumber ourselves with baggage. It would serve the rajah right if I were to burn his castle down; he may think himself lucky to get off with his life." ...|$|R
