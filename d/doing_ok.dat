40|$|Abstract Background The food {{industry}} uses market segmentation to target products toward specific groups of consumers with similar attitudinal, demographic, or lifestyle characteristics. Our aims were to identify distinguishable segments within the US overweight population to be targeted with messages and media aimed at moving Americans toward more healthy weights. Methods Cluster {{analysis was used}} to identify segments of consumers based on both food and lifestyle behaviors related to unhealthy weights. Drawing from Social Learning Theory, the Health Belief Model, and existing market segmentation literature, the study identified five distinct, recognizable market segments based on knowledge and behavioral and environmental factors. Implications for social marketing campaigns designed to move Americans toward more healthy weights were explored. Results The five clusters identified were: Highest Risk (19 %); At Risk (22 %); Right Behavior/Wrong Results (33 %); Getting Best Results (13 %); and <b>Doing</b> <b>OK</b> (12 %). Ninety-nine percent of those in the Highest Risk cluster were overweight; members watched the most television and exercised the least. Fifty-five percent of those in the At Risk cluster were overweight; members logged the most computer time and almost half rarely or never read food labels. Sixty-six percent of those in the Right Behavior/Wrong Results cluster were overweight; however, 95 % of them were familiar with the food pyramid. Members reported eating a low percentage of fast food meals (8 %) compared to other groups but a higher percentage of other restaurant meals (15 %). Less than six percent of those in the Getting Best Results cluster were overweight; every member read food labels and 75 % of members' meals were "made from scratch. " Eighteen percent of those in the <b>Doing</b> <b>OK</b> cluster were overweight; members watched the least television and reported eating 78 % of their meals "made from scratch. " Conclusion This study demonstrated that five distinct market segments can be identified for social marketing efforts aimed at addressing the obesity epidemic. Through the identification of these five segments, social marketing campaigns can utilize selected channels and messages that communicate the most relevant and important information. The results of this study offer insight into how segmentation strategies and social marketing messages may improve public health. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} design, {{prototype}} implementation, {{and evaluation of}} CenceMe, a personal sensing system that enables members of social networks to share their sensing presence with their buddies in a secure manner. Sensing presence captures a user’s status {{in terms of his}} activity (e. g., sitting, walking, meeting friends), disposition (e. g., happy, sad, <b>doing</b> <b>OK),</b> habits (e. g., at the gym, coffee shop today, at work) and surroundings (e. g., noisy, hot, bright, high ozone). CenceMe injects sensing presence into popular social networking applications such as Facebook, MySpace, and IM (Skype, Pidgin) allowing for new levels of “connection ” and implicit communication (albeit non-verbal) between friends in social networks. The CenceMe system is implemented, in part, as a thin-client on a number of standard and sensor-enabled cell phones and offers a number of services, which can be activated on a per-buddy basis to expose different degrees of a user’s sensing presence; these services include, life patterns, my presence, friend feeds, social interaction, significant places, buddy search, buddy beacon, and “above average?”...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) {{for the prevention}} of HIV transmission from mother to child {{is one of the greatest}} successes of antiretroviral therapy. However, concern has been expressed in several studies about potential side effects of antenatal and neonatal exposure to antiretroviral drugs such as the occurrence of low neutrophil cell in infants during the early months of life. A number of children were potentially eligible for the ANRS 12174 trial but were finally not included because their absolute neutrophil counts was low. These children are provided with nevirapine according to WHO recommendations and the national programme. Objectives: To investigate evolution of the neutrophil cell count during the first 6 months of life in HIV-­‐exposed, uninfected children subjected to antiretroviral drugs perinatally and with low neutrophil count. Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort study related to the ANRS 12174 trial. Subjects and methods: We enrolled 56 uninfected infants born to HIV-­‐positive mothers on antiretroviral drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine) during pregnancy and child birth, 18 with neutrophil count too low to be included in the trial (“study group”, receiving nevirapine during breastfeeding as ‘standard of care’) and 38 with neutrophil count just above the cut-­‐off for inclusion in the trial (“comparative group”, receiving one of the two study drugs, lamivudine/ Kaletra®). Maternal CD 4 + cell counts were assessed before delivery and neonatal characteristics include gender, gestational age, weight and length. Clinical condition, growth and absolute neutrophil count were followed up to 26 weeks of age. Non-­‐improvers were compared to improvers. Results: The mean gestational age at birth was 38. 0 (SD ± 1. 7) weeks and the mean birth weight was 3. 0 (± 0. 4) kg. There was gender balance in the group of 56 enrolled infants, 27 girls and 29 boys. The mean absolute neutrophil counts at day 7 and at week 26 were: 1) in the study group, 1. 0 (± 0. 2) and 1. 6 (± 0. 7), respectively; and 2) in the comparative group 1. 4 (± 0. 2) and 2. 1 (± 1. 2), respectively. The non-­‐improvers in terms of absolute neutrophil count (= deteriorating, remaining low or very slight improvement) in the study and the comparative group were 5 / 18 and 6 / 38 infants, 6 respectively). No statistical association was found between non-­‐improvement and selected potential predictors. All infants were apparently thriving with no apparent concurrent conditions and did not receive any other medications except for septrim and the follow-­‐up drugs. There was no statistically significant difference in growth between the non-­‐improvers and the improvers. Conclusion: With the limitations of this study, such as small sample size, lack of appropriate control group, low follow-­‐up intensity, short duration of follow-­‐up and the question mark around the usefulness of the DAIDS tables, we conclude that 1) infants exposed to HIV-­‐ 1 /ART antenatelly and who received nevirapine or lamivudine/Kaletra® from birth up to age week 26 may be at risk for transient low absolute neutrophil count; 2) such neutropenia can be moderate to severe and still not generate any apparent morbidity in the form of hospitalisations or other severe illnesses; 3) over the first 6 months, there is a good chance that the child recovers spontaneously and 4) these infants as a group present a growth as expected which is an indication that they are <b>doing</b> <b>OK...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mark Latham’s family-friendly {{strategy}} has its risks, according to David Burchell MARK LATHAM’S recent speeches and off-the-cuff remarks on family, personal and generational issues have garnered some curious media reactions. ‘Let me be your agony uncle’ was the Sydney Morning Herald’s sardonic {{reaction to his}} National Press Club speech {{a couple of weeks}} ago - which seemed odd, coming from a paper which runs more articles about stress and ‘work-life balance’ than your average men’s health magazine. Some in the media have made merry with images of Latham reading story-books to preschoolers, thumping soccer-balls, or striding through playgrounds with minders awkwardly in tow. A few ABC reporters have taken to using that note of heavy irony so familiar from the Iraq war, as if to suggest that any politician with an eye to social issues must surely be trading in humbug. Political journalists love to wear an air of world-wise cynicism - like a foxhole-full of battle-hardened GIs, or a hotel lobby-full of hard-boiled Chandleresque detectives - as though every ‘line’ a pollie can spin has already sailed over their heads three or fours times before. And so it’s hardly surprising that Latham’s line in social commentary has left them rather unmoved. ‘Really, sweetheart?’ you can almost hear them drawl. But it may be that on ‘social issues’ the press gallery is going to have to play catch-up. Obviously any major party leader who reminisces about their family history, or airs their dinner-table family chats to the National Press Club, is treading on thin ice. Yet despite the theatrics and the home-spun family wisdom, Latham’s relationship pitch is simply emphasising what both reporters and the government ought already to know - this is not the 1980 s or 1990 s, and economic policy no longer rules the political agenda. The 1980 s saw economics became - quite unexpectedly - the ‘sexy’ domain of policy debate. Economists whose previous role was to fill up dry columns on the inside pages of the business sections suddenly found themselves on prime-time television, reporting exchange rates or current account figures in breathy, excited tones. Over the past few years, though, the gloss has worn off the economic parable. Nowadays economics journalists who crave their place in the sun are forced to multi-skill. Everything from declining fertility and marriage rates to our national sense of well-being get the pop economics treatment, so that it’s sometimes hard to see where Hugh Mackay leaves off and the business pages begin. In fact the ‘traction’ of economics-speak was always overstated. In survey after survey Australians have nominated issues other than macroeconomic policy as their chief political motivators. In the 2001 Australian Election Study only taxation rated as an economic issue of consequence among voters - presumably because they’ve learned to regard three-yearly tax bribes as part of the electoral process. By contrast, industrial relations - that grand obsession of business journalists - enthused almost no one. Even during the passionate debates over ‘economic rationalism’ and the fate of rural Australia, the real agenda for most Australians wasn’t protectionism versus free trade, but that sense of common culture which pervades most of our images of ‘traditional’ Australian public values. People resented the closure of country banks not because they liked standing in queues all lunch-hour, but because they felt their stake in the common weal had somehow dwindled, in an indefinable way. Likewise, the pervasive sense of resentment and neglect in the outer suburbs of our major cities can’t be attributed primarily to economic issues. After all, these are areas where increasing numbers of houses are growing towards the side-fences of their blocks, and where rattly ’ 80 s Falcons are not infrequently being exchanged for gleaming four-wheel drives. Rather, what troubles the punters in these parts is how to thrive and better themselves in neighbourhoods which aren’t conducive to neighbourliness or community spirit, and where the teenagers have nowhere safe and convivial to hang out on Saturday night. Latham’s been thumping the tub hard on these issues, trying to ignite a spark of recognition in the weary imaginations of hard-working suburbanites. (One suspects too that he’s taken up Paul Keating’s old advice about ‘flicking the switch to vaudeville’.) He needs to: there’s an election looming and not much time to get the message across. But the press gallery’s instincts are serving them well in one respect, at least. There’s a real danger that in this flurry of emotional enthusiasm Labor could take its new family-friendly, relationship-sympathetic image a mite too far. There’s a danger, for instance, that Lindsay Tanner, Labor’s new shadow minister for community relationships, could find that musing poetically about loneliness, alienation and our old friend, ‘work-life balance’, becomes addictive. The problem here is that loneliness, alienation and a sense of emptiness in one’s life aren’t always politically address-able in any obvious way. Teenagers in Toorak and Chatswood can sink into deliciously agonising angst in their bedrooms just as well as can unemployed kids from Liverpool or Sunshine. And well-heeled professionals can detect in themselves a profound sense of spiritual emptiness at one and the same time as they’re thriving in every measurable aspect of their outer lives. It may be that well-written self-help manuals and a smattering of pop-Buddhism can have more success here than can any known public policy measure. Even that magic term ‘stress’, so beloved of upwardly mobile professionals and gym membership-holders, conceals as much as it reveals. Recently the Bureau of Statistics attempted to measure the sense of ‘connectedness’ of Australians of different ages, localities and incomes, and to measure their ‘stress indicators’, in the language of the new ‘social capital’-focused political science. The results were - or at least should have been - mostly unsurprising. The well-to-do have more time and energy to devote to charitable work, and to being good citizens. The poor and the elderly have a limited range of social contacts and experiences. Those in the middle are mostly <b>doing</b> <b>OK</b> on both counts. The strongest indicator of high levels of personal stress is not ‘work-life imbalance’ but good old-fashioned ill-health - a factor which rises alarmingly in incidence to poorer and the older you get. The strongest indicator of household stress isn’t having too much paid work to negotiate around, but too little. To put the matter crudely, Labor’s new social agenda offers both benefits and risks. It can find a new way to tap into the frustrations and resentments of working families of varying household types and geographical locations. Or it can pander to the psychic self-obsessions of the highly visible and voluble professional classes. The trick, as they say, is to find the right balance. Call it yin and yang if you will.
