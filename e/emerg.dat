40|$|We {{report on}} the thermospheric mass density anomaly in the {{vicinity}} of the ionospheric cusp. A systematic survey of the anomalies is presented, based on a statistical analysis of 4 years of data (2002 – 2005) obtained by the accelerometer onboard CHAMP. The anomalies are detected during all years and seasons in both hemispheres but with stronger signatures in the Northern Hemisphere. For the same geophysical conditions, solar flux and geomagnetic activity the anomalies in the north are larger by a factor of about 1. 35. Over the course of the survey period the amplitude decreases by more than a factor of 5 while the level of solar flux reduces by a factor of 2. The anomaly strength also depends on the solar wind input. The merging electric field, <b>Emerg,</b> is generally enhanced for about an hour before the anomaly detection. There is a quadratic response of the anomaly amplitude to <b>Emerg.</b> For geophysical conditions of P 10. 7 &lt; 150 and Emerg&lt; 1 mV/m hardly any events are detected. Their amplitudes are found to be controlled by an additive effect of P 10. 7 and <b>Emerg,</b> where the weight of <b>Emerg,</b> in mV/m, is by about 50 times higher than that of the solar flux level. The solar zenith angle and the influence of particle precipitation are found to play a minor role as a controlling parameter of seasonal variation. The well-known annual variation of the thermospheric density with a minimum around June also influences the formation of the cusp anomalies. This leads to a clear hemispheric asymmetry with very weak anomalies in the south during June solstice, which is supposed to be a combined effect of the minimum in annual variation and the seasonal decrease of solar insolation in this region...|$|E
