40|$|Nowadays, making {{strategic}} decisions <b>in</b> a <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector</b> such {{as energy}} planning that usually requires allocating huge funds, time, and resources {{is a difficult}} task.

This process is aligned with several sources that can be uncertain, including imprecise information, limited domain knowledge from decisionmakers, and failures to provide accurate judgments from experts. In this study, we propose to use the Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach to manage the expanding complexities and uncertainties in RES prioritization problem. The ER approach is employed as a multiple criteria framework to assess the appropriateness {{regarding the use of}} different renewable energy technologies.

More than ten insurance companies have entered the pollution insurance market with their own products and contracts. Companies <b>in</b> environmentally <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> and high-risk industries bought pollution insurance, and a few successful compensation cases have been reported. Still, pollution insurance faces a number of challenges in China. The absence of a national law weakens the legal basis of pollution insurance, and poor technical support stagnates further implementation. Moreover, current pollution insurance products have limited risk coverage, high premium rates, and low loss ratios, which make them fairly unattractive to polluters. Meanwhile, low awareness of environmental and social liabilities leads to limited demand for pollution insurance products by industrial companies. Hence, the pollution insurance market is not yet flourishing in China. To improve this situation, this economic instrument needs stronger backing by the Chinese state...|$|R

The development {{is carried out}} within nine face-to-face interviews conducted with decision makers, working <b>in</b> climate <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> at the German Baltic Sea coast. Three main groups of categories were localized which seem to matter most to the considered stakeholders and which seem to be crucial evaluation categories for regional climate services: (1)  credibility, (2)  relevance, and (3)  appropriateness. For each of these evaluation categories several dimensions emerged, indicating certain perspectives of stakeholder demands. When summarizing these evaluation categories and their dimensions, 13  evaluation criteria for regional climate services can be derived (see Table  1). The results show that stakeholders do mainly address components other than {{those found in the}} literature (e. g.  inputs, process, outputs, outcomes, and impacts). This might indicate that an evaluation, following solely literature-based (non-participative) components, is not sufficient to localize deficiencies or efficiencies within a regional climate service, since it might lead to results which are not relevant for potential users...|$|R

We find that private ownership is positively associated with overall economic development and investment liberalization in the host country and with greenfield (vs divestiture) and joint venture (vs wholly owned) projects. Private ownership is negatively associated with existing telecommunications infrastructure, higher levels of state ownership of foreign investing firms, and the technological sophistication of the projects. Our analysis also shows a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between investment policy hazards and private ownership. This finding supports the insight from transaction cost economics that potential gains from internalization are greatest at intermediate levels of uncertainty.

The paper then considers what institutional approaches might facilitate further domestic structural reforms. Key to this are mechanisms to review the desirability and performance of all regulations and institutions on an ongoing basis, {{and in a way}} that involves all relevant stakeholders. Such policy review institutions can provide technical solutions, helping to identify particular reform options. They can also be part of a strategy to manage the domestic political economy of reform, by providing a forum in which countervailing interests could marshal against vested interests, thus helping to build a coalition in favour of reform. Finally, they can facilitate policy coordination within and across levels of government.

40|$|The European Community (EC), in particular, took {{upon itself}} {{the role of}} the key {{external}} player in the political and economic restructuring programs in Eastern Europe. It successfully used a combination of aid packages and advice-giving, to frame its political and economic relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For their part, the Eastern states, hoping for a quick path to a convertible currency and EU membership, fully embraced the free market philosophy by swallowing the bitter pill of shock therapy, mass privatization and deregulation. The Eastern Europeans have gradually come to a significant twofold realization. First, that membership {{is not likely to be}} offered any time soon. And second, that there are significant barriers to the strengthening of ties with the EU. The EU eventually responded to the growing pleas for membership by announcing that the special relationship between Western and Eastern Europe would be assured through association agreements pursuant to Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome. Initially, the EU did not intend to make any reference in the Europe Agreements to future membership of the Association countries. A major indicator in the Europe Agreements, which highlights the EU's fundamental concern over its own interests rather than assisting Eastern Europe in the transition process, are the trade provisions. In essence, these maintain significant, potentially long-term barriers to trade between the EC and the East, particularly <b>in</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> such as steel, textiles and agriculture. A second obstacle to the Associate countries' accession are the relatively weak institutional links created by the Europe Agreements. Convergence of laws is another important condition which needs to be satisfied before membership is granted to the Eastern European applicants. The present approach excludes the Eastern Europeans from exemption from the EU's anti-dumping law; it shuts them out of most of the EU's decision making; and it limits the effectiveness of their attempts to harmonise their legislation with the EU. Taken collectively, it seems certain that these exclusions will seriously restrict the Associates' prospects of rapid integration into the EU. The compromise may involve complicated negotiations between member states and also with potential applicants.

Påverkar företags branschtillhörighet frekvensen av negativ information i hållbarhetsredovisningar?   Syfte:            Syftet med uppsatsen är att undersöka informationsbalansen i hållbarhetsredovisningar genom att studera i vilken utsträckning negativ information presenteras. Uppsatsen undersöker även om branschtillhörighet påverkar frekvensen av negativ information.     Metod:         I studien tillämpats en kvantitativ metod med innehållsanalys. Teoriinsamlingen är baserad på vetenskapliga artiklar som handlar om hållbarhetsredovisning, branschtillhörighet, GRI, legitimitets-, signal- och intressentteorin. För att samla in data användes ett urval av 150 hållbarhetsredovisningar. Resultaten har analyserats genom deskriptiv analys och Chi 2 -tester.          Slutsats:       De slutsatser som gjorts i denna undersökning är att företag redovisar mer positiv än negativ information, men att skillnaden inte var speciellt stor. Branschtillhörigheten påverkar frekvensen av negativ information. Det visade sig att företag i miljökänsliga branscher kommunicerar två gånger mer negativ information än företag i icke-miljökänsliga branscher.  ABSTRACT “Sustainability reporting – A {{study on the}} information balance in high profile and low profile industries ”   Date:            June 5 th 2017   Level:           Bachelor thesis in Business Administration, 15 ECTS   Institution:  School of Business, Society and Engineering, Mälardalen University   Authors:      Björn Sandfeldt                  Henrik Robertsson                       3 th Mars 1994                      5 th May 1992   Title:             Sustainability reporting – A study on the information balance in high profile and low profile industries   Tutor:          Staffan Boström   Keywords:   Sustainability reporting, GRI, negative information, industries, transparency and balance.      Questions: In what volume does negative information get presented in sustainability reports? Does the sector of firms influence the amount of presented negative information in sustainability reports?   Purpose:      The purpose of this essay {{is to examine the}} information balance in sustainability reporting, by studying the amount of negative information presented. The essay also studies if the sector of firms influences the amount of negative information.      Method:       The essay uses a quantitive research method with content analysis. The theory of the studie is based on academic journals that contains information about sustainability reporting, sector, GRI, legitimacy-, signaling- and stakeholder theory. The primary data consist of a sample of 150 sustainability reports.
