5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
25|$|Dent {{received}} his primary education in Canadian schools, studied law in Brantford, Ontario, {{and became an}} attorney in 1865. He practised law for a few years, but found the profession did not suit him, and was drawn to pursue literary endeavours instead. He accordingly relinquished his practice as soon as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{in a position to}} do so, and went to England.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher {{received}} the George Cross {{for his actions}} whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan. The incident occurred whilst on a reconnaissance patrol, when upon entering a compound <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> activate a grenade tripwire. L/Cpl Croucher deliberately fell onto the device aiming to protect his colleagues from the blast. Fortunately he managed to cushion {{the majority of the}} blast with his Bergen whilst his body armour stopped further shrapnel, this left him with only minor injuries and his fellow Marines unharmed.|$|E
25|$|McClellan's {{replacement}} was Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, {{the commander}} of the IX Corps. Burnside had established a reputation as an independent commander, with successful operations earlier that year in coastal North Carolina and, unlike McClellan, had no apparent political ambitions. However, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> unqualified for army-level command and objected when offered the position. He accepted only when it was made clear to him that McClellan would be replaced in any event and that an alternative choice for command was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked and distrusted. Burnside assumed command on November 7.|$|E
25|$|In New York he was {{steeped in}} the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period. He {{exhibited}} in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters David Burliuk, Pavel Tchelitchew, Walter Houmère, Rufino Tamayo and Mario Carreño and (later) Edward Laning. Far from setting out to become a ‘Dominican’ painter, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{to be part of}} a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Américo Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings.|$|E

25|$|Animated by intense {{hatred of}} the Spanish faction, Paget lost no time after his arrival at Paris in putting himself in {{communication}} with Sir Henry Neville, the English ambassador, who forwarded {{a detailed account of}} the circumstances to Sir Robert Cecil in a despatch dated 27 June (O.S.) 1599. Cecil seems to have been by no means anxious to encourage Paget, but Neville was more favourable to him. Paget said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> slighted by the English government, but he nevertheless seems to have given from time to time important intelligence to Neville and to Ralph Winwood the succeeding ambassador at the French court. His attainder appears to have been reversed in the first parliament of James I, probably by the act restoring in blood his nephew William, Lord Paget, and it is presumed that he returned to England. His paternal estate, including the manor of Weston on Trent and other manors in Derbyshire, was restored to him on 13 July 1603; and on 18 August in the same year James I granted him £200 per annum, part of a fee-farm rent reserved by a patent of Queen Elizabeth, bestowing the lands of Lord Paget on William Paget and his heirs. He died, probably in England, about the beginning of February 1611-1612, leaving a good estate to the sons of one of his sisters.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{race in the}} spring season was the Amstel Gold Race. This race, like the other Ardennes {{classics}} to follow, is much more hilly than the cobbled classics, and thus the three leaders from {{earlier in the season}} were not part of the team's squad. The team did send the runner-up from the 2010 race, Hesjedal, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be on strong form entering the race. However, the Canadian was quite sick on race day, with stomach issues that caused him to be second from last in this year's edition, over 14 minutes down on the winner. The team's best finisher was Fischer in 28th. Hesjedal had largely recovered for La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, but he was not a factor in the conclusion to either race, coming 13th in Flèche Wallonne and 29th in Liège. He was the team's best finisher in Liège, but Le Mével did him better in Flèche Wallonne, riding to ninth place to secure 6 UCI rankings points. Martin took his first win of the season at the Giro della Toscana in June. Le Mével {{had been part of the}} last breakaway group to be caught before the finale, occupying first position on the road into the final kilometer of the race on the steep Stoppe d'Arca climb. Martin was part of a six-man group that caught and overhauled him, and he won the sprint to deliver for the team.|$|E
500|$|The elder Southard's {{life was}} often busy and sleepless. According to L. Vernon Briggs, a {{colleague}} at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Southard considered himself hypomanic. [...] "He himself said {{that most people}} fell within one of the classifications of mental disease, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{to be of the}} manic-depressive type. We seldom saw the depressive side of him though it was undoubtedly there; ordinarily he appeared carried away with enthusiasm about his latest interest– and everything worthwhile interested him", Briggs wrote.|$|E

Here he became intimate with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's friend Julie de Bondeli.|$|R

500|$|The Canadian {{director}} Mike Hoolboom {{was diagnosed}} with HIV in 1988 or 1989, after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became [...] "fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again", experimenting with [...] "interruptive rhythms" [...] {{as a way to}} reexamine simple acts. Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; Frank's Cock was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, after {{attending}} {{a series of}} preparatory schools, Olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of All Saints, Margaret Street, in central London. His elder brother was already a pupil, and Olivier gradually settled in, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{to be something of}} an outsider. The church's style of worship was (and remains) Anglo-Catholic, with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense. The theatricality of the services appealed to Olivier, and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama. In a school production of Julius Caesar in 1917, the ten-year-old Olivier's performance as Brutus impressed an audience that included Lady Tree, the young Sybil Thorndike, and Ellen Terry, who wrote in her diary, [...] "The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor." [...] He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in Twelfth Night (1918) and Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew (1922).|$|E
500|$|In {{works like}} the Serenade for Strings and the Variations on a Rococo Theme, Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at {{writing in a}} style of 18th century European pastiche. [...] In the ballet The Sleeping Beauty and the opera The Queen of Spades, Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls [...] "passé-ism," [...] lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem {{as though it were}} the present. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to Igor Stravinsky, who turned to Neoclassicism partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed the}} {{gathering}} of neighborhood about Kenton, where <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> so unfriended, against the outrage done him, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the sweetness of being personally championed {{in a place where}} he had thought himself valued merely for the profit that was in him; his eyes filled, and his voice failed him in thanking the elevator-boy for running before him to ring the bell of his apartment.|$|R
500|$|As {{the war in}} Europe drew to a {{close and}} the United Nations Charter was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being {{considered}} to become the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, with American Secretary of State Dean Acheson and British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy. Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions. In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a [...] "world food board" [...] to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages. He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a world food reserve and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need. Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, international development aid, commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947. The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.|$|E
500|$|Following Tewkesbury, Suffolk {{was granted}} the estates of the under-age Francis, Viscount Lovell during Lovell's minority, {{and may have}} {{received}} {{the custody of the}} ex-Lancastrian Queen, Margaret of Anjou, in 1472, since Margaret was held at one point in Wallingford and subsequently in Ewelme. This was followed by a number of other offices and promotions, none of which were lucrative. In 1472 he was appointed High Steward of Oxford University and the following year made a Knight of the Garter. He was also the King's Lieutenant of Ireland (in later centuries the post {{came to be known as}} the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) between March and July 1478 (although he probably never took the position in person). So little, in fact, had his financial situation improved, that in the first parliament after Edward's return from exile- in 1471 – Suffolk refused his summons to attend parliament. This was because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> unable to sustain the status and maintain the retinue of a royal duke in London for whatever duration the parliament turned out to be. With the exception of the Lovell estates Suffolk received no major grants, in stark comparison to Edward's brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and even the king's Woodville in-laws. Suffolk's continuing poverty was reflected in the fact that, although he again took loyal part in King Edward's 1475 French campaign (on possibly the only occasion he ever went abroad), he could muster only forty men-at-arms and 300 archers. Michael Hicks remarks that, as a retinue, this [...] "fell far short of those of other royal dukes." [...] Soon after his return from France his mother, the Duchess Alice, died; certainly by 15 August 1476, when John finally came into possession of her dower lands, and by extension, finally, his whole estate. She was buried at Ewelme, Oxfordshire in a [...] "stunning alabaster monument." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{while the}} women were marching, {{suspicious}} eyes looked upon Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, already behind the July uprisings, as being somehow responsible for the event. The Duke, a cousin of Louis XVI, was an energetic proponent of constitutional monarchy, {{and it was an}} open secret that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be uniquely qualified to be king under such a system. Though allegations of his specific actions concerning the October march remain largely unproven, he has long been considered a significant instigator of the events. The Duke was certainly present as a deputy to the Assembly, and he was described by contemporaries as smiling warmly as he walked among the protesters {{at the height of the}} siege; many of them are said to have hailed him with greetings like [...] "Here is our king! Long live King Orléans!" [...] Many scholars believe that the Duke paid agents provocateurs to fan the discontent in the marketplaces and to conflate the women's march for bread with the drive to bring the king back to Paris. Others suggest he coordinated in some way with Mirabeau, the Assembly's most powerful statesman at the time, to use the marchers to advance the constitutionalist agenda. Still others go so far as to assert that the crowd was guided by such important Orléanist allies as Antoine Barnave, Choderlos de Laclos, and the duc d'Aiguillon, all dressed as poissardes in women's clothes. Yet most of the Revolution's foremost histories describe any involvement of the Duke as ancillary to the action, efforts of opportunism that neither created nor defined the October march. The Duke was investigated by the crown for complicity and none was proven. Still, the pall of suspicion helped convince him to take on Louis XVI's offer of a diplomatic mission conveniently outside the country. He returned to France the following summer and resumed his place in the Assembly where both he and Mirabeau were officially exonerated of any misdeeds regarding the march. As the Revolution moved forward into the Terror, the Duke's royal lineage and alleged avarice convicted him in the minds of radical leaders and he was sent to his execution in November 1793.|$|E

60|$|It {{was with}} an {{expectancy}} which was slightly toned down by misgivings that Hawtrey drove {{over to the}} homestead where Agatha was staying the next afternoon.
