5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as <b>hunting</b> <b>trophies,</b> or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{sculptor}} Emilio Sala {{was responsible}} for both {{the internal and external}} sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs {{on the roof of the}} building, sinking ships and <b>hunting</b> <b>trophies</b> on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers depicting huge catfish strangled in the stems of lotus flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the building material.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> has {{potential}} to support conservation financing and contribute towards rural development. We conducted a systematic {{review of the}} Zimbabwean <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> perspective spanning from pre- 1890 to 2015, by examining the following: (1) evolution of legal instruments, administration, and governance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting,</b> (2) significance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> in conservation financing and rural development, and (3) key challenges, emerging issues in <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> industry, and future interventions. Our review shows that (i) {{there has been a}} constant evolution in the policies related to <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> and conservation in Zimbabwe as driven by local and international needs; (ii) <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> providing incentives for wildlife conservation (e. g., law enforcement and habitat protection) and rural communities’ development. Emerging issues that may affect <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> include illegal hunting, inadequate monitoring systems, and hunting bans. We conclude that <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> is still relevant in wildlife conservation and rural communities’ development especially in developing economies where conservation financing is inadequate due to fiscal constraints. We recommend the promotion of net conservation benefits for positive conservation efforts and use of wildlife conservation credits for the opportunity costs associated with reducing <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> off-take levels and promoting nonconsumptive wildlife use options...|$|R

2500|$|During the 1950s, buffalo were {{hunted for}} their skins and meat, which was {{exported}} {{and used in}} the local trade. In the late 1970s, live exports were made to Cuba and continued later into other countries. Buffalo are now crossed with riverine buffalo in artificial insemination programs, and {{may be found in}} many areas of Australia. Some of these crossbreds are used for milk production. Melville Island is a popular hunting location, where a steady population up to 4,000 individuals exists. Safari outfits are run from Darwin to Melville Island and other locations in the Top End, often with the use of bush pilots.

2500|$|Fame blows her [...] "posterior trumpet," [...] {{and all the}} dunces of {{the land}} come to Dulness's throne. There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the {{naturally}} dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they [...] "adhere" [...] to her person. The second {{are the people who}} do not wish to be dunces but are, [...] "Whate'er of mungril no one class admits,/ A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits" [...] (B IV 89–90). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are [...] "false to Phoebus, bow to Baal;/ Or impious, preach his Word without a call" [...] (B IV 93–4). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does: [...] although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding. [...] Of this last group, Pope classes Sir Thomas Hanmer, a [...] "decent knight," [...] who absurdly thinks himself a great Shakespeare editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope's own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of John Milton, striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton's Latin poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for Arthur Johnston, a Scottish physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but [...] "Apollo's May'r and Aldermen" [...] (B IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to Oxford University Press, with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying Bishop Warburton a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like <b>hunting</b> <b>trophies),</b> and thus [...] "So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit" [...] (B IV 131).|$|E

60|$|The way, therefore, lay open to {{the great}} hall or outer {{vestibule}} of the Lodge. One end of this long and dusky apartment was entirely occupied by a gallery, which had in ancient times served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels. There was a clumsy staircase at either side of it, composed of entire logs of a foot square; and in each angle of the ascent was placed, by way of sentinel, {{the figure of a}} Norman foot-soldier, having an open casque on his head, which displayed features as stern as the painter's genius could devise. Their arms were buff-jackets, or shirts of mail, round bucklers, with spikes in the centre, and buskins which adorned and defended the feet and ankles, but left the knees bare. These wooden warders held great swords, or maces, in their hands, like military guards on duty. Many an empty hook and brace, along the walls of the gloomy apartment, marked the spots from which arms, long preserved as trophies, had been, in the pressure of the wars, once more taken down, to do service in the field, like veterans whom extremity of danger recalls to battle. On other rusty fastenings were still displayed the <b>hunting</b> <b>trophies</b> of the monarchs to whom the Lodge belonged, and of the silvan knights to whose care it had been from time to time confided.|$|E
