2500|$|The Natchez Trace Parkway is {{the second}} major National Parkway, a {{projected}} [...] roadway through a protected zone of <b>forest,</b> <b>meadow,</b> and field which generally follows {{the route of the}} historic Natchez Trace from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The Old Natchez Trace was once an Indian path, then a wilderness road, and finally from 1800 to 1830 a highway binding the old Southwest to the Union. The parkway was completed in 2003 with the final link south of Nashville, Tennessee. The parkway links historic and natural features including Mount Locust, the earliest inn on the Trace, Emerald Mound, one of the largest Indian ceremonial structures in the United States, Chickasaw Village and Bynum Mounds in Mississippi, and Colbert's Ferry and Metal Ford in Tennessee.|$|E

5000|$|Almost all of {{the land}} that today {{comprises}} the <b>Forest</b> <b>Meadow,</b> Moss Farm, and Town Creek neighborhoods of Dallas lay {{within the bounds of}} properties in the possession of pioneer settler James M. Houx (1822-1850), his wife Amanda L. Houx (1829-1847), and their son Nicholas T. Houx (1847-1890). James and Amanda Houx came to Dallas County, Texas, from Kentucky in 1846 or 1847, but Amanda died in childbirth when Nicholas was born on June 30, 1847. James M. Houx purchased a tract of 306 acres in this area from William M. Simpson and his wife Lettitia Simpson on October 27, 1849. However, James M. Houx had died by November of the next year when the federal census (1850) showed Nicholas as the adopted son of Judge John S. and Mrs. Hannah Thomas. Judge Thomas (the first County Judge in Dallas County) apparently assisted his young adopted son to receive a 640-acre land grant {{in the name of the}} [...] "Heirs of James M. Houx, Deceased" [...] from the State of Texas, given under a patent signed by Texas Governor Elisha Marshall Pease on February 28, 1855. The 1849 purchase of 306 acres did not fall within the present bounds of <b>Forest</b> <b>Meadow,</b> though it did include much of the area that is now Moss Farm. The larger grant of 640 acres in 1855 adjoined the earlier grant and it included almost {{all of the}} area that is now <b>Forest</b> <b>Meadow</b> and Town Creek.|$|E
50|$|The Big Thicket National Preserve was {{established}} by Congress in 1974. This combination of virgin pine and cypress forest, hardwood <b>forest,</b> <b>meadow</b> and blackwater swamp is managed by the National Park Service. The Preserve {{was established}} to protect the remnant of its complex biological diversity. What is so extraordinary is not the rarity or abundance of its life forms, but how many species coexist here.|$|E
5000|$|The {{land was}} further {{subdivided}} after {{the time of}} the Sebastian family. The Houston & Texas Central Railroad (now the DART Red Line) had come through the area in 1873, and in the twentieth century, the land became more and more part of the growing city of Dallas. In 1916, the road that is now North Greenville Avenue adjacent to the neighborhood, previously called [...] "Richardson Road," [...] was designated as Texas State Highway 6. In 1926, the road was redesignated as US Highway 75 (Route 75) and remained so until North Central Expressway was constructed in the 1950s. In the early twentieth century small parcels were utilized as suburban farms where people who worked in Dallas could maintain a semblance of rural life. Dallas oil developer William A. [...] "Bill" [...] Browne (or Brown), for example, owned a suburban farm on 25 acres in the larger Houx survey that he had purchased in the 1940s and that is now part of <b>Forest</b> <b>Meadow.</b> This is now the subdivision of <b>Forest</b> <b>Meadow</b> platted as [...] "Bill Browne's Farm," [...] including Bill Browne Drive.|$|E

It may occur in dry or wet habitat, several soil types, flat territory and slopes, and a range of temperatures. It can be found at elevation in subalpine and alpine climates. Plant species occurring with this cinquefoil in multiple habitat types include prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), elk sedge (Carex geyeri), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), silvery lupine (Lupinus argenteus), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and beautiful fleabane (Erigeron formosissimus).|$|E
50|$|The Lost Woods (Mayoi no Mori) is a large, maze-like {{forest that}} appears in various titles.

In many games, the Lost Woods is a maze that leads Link in circles, with the correct path indicated by a recurring melody.|$|E

It has an adjoining private stretch of the Beaverkill used to teach wading, streamcraft, and obstacle casting.
