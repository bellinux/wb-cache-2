500|$|Since its release, The Blair Witch Project {{has been}} widely {{regarded}} by many as an influence to an array of subsequent films similarly using the found footage concept and the conventions the film established.

Some critics have also noted the film as being strikingly similar to Cannibal Holocaust (1980), and The Last Broadcast (1998) in terms of basic plot premise and narrative style. Although Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato has acknowledged the similarities of The Blair Witch Project to his film, he criticized the publicity that it received for being an original production; advertisements for The Blair Witch Project also promoted {{the idea that the}} footage is genuine. Despite initial reports by media outlets such as the New York Post and E! Entertainment that The Last Broadcast creators, Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler, had alleged that The Blair Witch Project was a complete rip-off of their work and would sue Haxan Films for copyright infringement, they repudiated these allegations.

2500|$|The American {{casualties}} may be ascertained {{from two}} documents written by Colonel Otho Holland Williams, General Greene's deputy adjutant-general. The first of these, a ‘List {{of the officers}} killed, wounded, and taken prisoners, in the action before Camden, the 25th of April, 1781’, details 1 officer and 18 enlisted men killed, 5 officers and 108 enlisted men wounded, 2 officers captured (one of them wounded) and 136 enlisted men missing. Williams wrote, “The greatest part {{of those who are}} missing had not well understood the order to rally at Saunder's creek; some were killed; 47 of them were wounded, and are in the enemy's hospital; we have tidings of about one third of the remaining number, and <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to join us”. The second of these documents is a letter from Williams to his brother, dated April 27, in which he wrote, “Capt I. Smith of the Third, and Capt Lunt [...] Bruff are both prisoners, last wounded. Lieut Trueman is a prisoner, and it is said thirty-nine privates of our army are taken, besides a number wounded, the whole amounting to about fifty” This would indicate that 2 officers and 39 enlisted men were taken prisoner apart from the 1 officer and 47 enlisted men who were wounded and captured. The total American loss at Hobkirk’s Hill would therefore appear to be 19 killed; 113 wounded; 48 wounded prisoners; 41 unwounded prisoners and 50 missing unaccounted for, some of whom were killed.|$|E

Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> do something special and revealing for us.'" [...] Philip Marino, in The University of Chicago Magazine, commented: [...] "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' says Daniel Mendelsohn". Glen Weldon, writing for NPR, concurred: [...] "He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview." [...] Professor Peter Brown wrote: [...] "Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob’s own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart". In The Nation, Harvard professor Stanley Hoffmann observed that, in publishing {{some of the earliest}} criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: [...] "In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the Review in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media." [...] The Nation added, during the Iraq war:One suspects [...] yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly pastiche of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that The New York Review of Books ... was there when we needed it most.|$|E

During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J's home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going to be back in the studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (7/23/2014 - 7/27/2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, /), along with a certification of authenticity signed by Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope, 6 tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014. In a July 6, 2014 interview Faygoluvers.net conducted with Jumpsteady, he stated that Psychopathic is currently working with some new supergroups. At the 2014 GOTJ during Anybody Killa's seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo have created a new group called The Have Nots. Insane Clown Posse have composed a group with Da Mafia 6ix called The Killjoy Club, and will be releasing their debut album titled Reindeer Games on September 2, 2014.

The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck will be released [...] "sooner than you think". The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon".

The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records. In early October 2014 it was announced that [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] will be pushed back to a 2015 release creating speculation that Psychopathic will release the album. Instead DM6 will release a mixxtape titled Hear Some Evil in October 2014. The First Six was initially scheduled to be released on October 28, 2014, but after a minor setback it is now scheduled to be released on November 25, 2014.
