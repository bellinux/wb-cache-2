40|$|This work {{presents}} results {{which help}} {{to understand the}} behaviour of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies over the South America continent during the two strongest El Nino {{events of the last}} century (1982 - 1983 and 1997 - 1998). The data used are parts of a long-term series (July 1981 to December 1999) of calibrated NDVI data derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) datasets. Special emphasis has been given to the analysis of the response of the major Brazilian vegetation types. This paper introduces an approach that enhances NDVI anomalies relative to the long-term climatology of the region. We find a negative NDVI anomaly for most of the region during the 1982 - 1983 event, whereas for the 1997 - 1998 event positive NDVI anomalies were observed over most regions. Only the Nordeste region showed a similar vegetation response for both events. We identify three possible factors that {{may play a role in}} the different NDVI responses to the two El Nino events. Firstly, poor <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> may account for some, but not all of the differences. Secondly the response of the vegetation may depend upon the climate conditions prior to the El Nino events. Thirdly, the difference in the onset date and the duration of the mature phase of the two El Nino events, associated with very different Atlantic surface temperatures are shown to have dynamical consequences which may impact upon the vegetation.

40|$|PARASOL is a {{satellite}} which provided multidirectional and polarized {{observation of the}} Earth reflectances for the visible and near infrared spectral range for nearly 9 -years, from 2005 to 2013. A rich archive of top-of-atmosphere reflectances have been collected over deep convective clouds (DCC) according a devoted data selection. This selection is able to guarantee observation very suitable for calibration purpose {{as well as a}} consistent time series (regarding morphology, geometry, radiometry). These selection criteria are described in Fougnie and Bach (IEEE, 2009). DCC are used for a long while for calibration purposes. First, they were used for interband calibration in the visible range (e. g. for POLDER and Végétation sensors). DCC were very powerful for an accurate monitoring or validation of the sensor degradation with time (e. g. PARASOL, MERIS). DCC were also used to derive the sensor degradation within the entire field-of-view (e. g. PARASOL). Finally, DCC are intensively used for cross-calibration of LEO and GEO sensors in the GSICS framework. It is known that DCC are very white targets (or with minor variations with respect to the white behaviour) on the visible and near infrared spectral domain. They are also characterized by a moderate bidirectional signature. PARASOL data collected over the entire archive were used to derive the bidirectional function (BRDF) of the DCC reflectance. For every spectral band, all acquisitions (more than 1 million) were assumed to be generated by the same “mean” cloud. Five ranges of 10 ° solar zenith angles were built, and on which acquisitions were geometrically binned into 2 °x 2 ° boxes in viewing zenith and relative azimuth angles. Results for 490, 670 and 865 will be presented. BRDF effects are found to be very similar for the visible range, about 15 %, and are a little bite smaller for the near infrared band, about 10 %. It appears that the most isotropic part of the BRDF corresponds to the backscattering geometries. Computation using radiative transfer code based on discrete ordinate (Lafrance et al., IEEE, 2002) were built. The top of DCC were described as pure hexagonal crystals (PHM), but also Inhomogeneous Hexagonal Monocrystals (RHM). Top of atmosphere reflectances were generated for all geometries and for visible to near infrared bands. Comparison with PARASOL observation, and highlighting a good agreement, will be presented. Finally, results will be confronted to the directional model from Hu et al. (2004) used as reference in the framework of GSICS for <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors.</b> The general conclusion will try to recommend geometries for which the cross-calibration will be optimized in term of uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|The Megha-Tropiques {{satellite}} (MT), a joint program between France and India, {{was launched}} on October 12, 2011 into a low inclination (20 °) orbit. The payload includes two microwave sensors, Madras, a conically-scanning window channel radiometer and the cross-track-scanning SAPHIR, a water-vapor sounder with 6 channels {{centered on the}} 183 GHz water vapor line. Here we {{are concerned with the}} use of SAPHIR for <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> {{within the context of the}} Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM). Some precipitation retrieval algorithms, most notably those concerned with separating falling snow from snow already on the ground use 183 GHz water vapor sounding channels. The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) includes channels near 183 GHz to be used directly for these retrievals. Also GPM plans to use the water vapor sounders on the polar-orbiting operational satellites, NOAA and METOP for precipitaton retrievals. Thus, GPM will be used to intercalibrate the water vapor sounders. Before the launch of Megha-Tropiques, there were no 183 GHz radiometers in low-inclination orbits to facilitate intercomparison of the operational microwave water vapor sounders. Thus, SAPHIR represents an opportunity to preview the use of GMI for intercalibration of water vapor sounders. Because of the low inclination of MT, there are a great many co-located, nearly-simultaneous observations between MT and the various satellites spread over a range of roughly 25 S to 25 N. For the sub-set of the data where the incidence angles and frequencies of SAPHIR and the sensor with which it is being compared are close enough to identical, direct comparisons are possible; in other cases, an algorithm is needed. Typically an intercalibration effort begins with examination of each single sensor for reasonableness and self consistency. Images of the data are the most obvious test. One and two dimensional histograms allow us to examine a large volume of data for wild-points. Any sensor particularly one in the early stages of analysis will have some issues and SAPHIR is no exception. The data are examined for scan position dependant biases. Such biases in SAPHIR are very small, well below any reasonable limit for intercalibration work. When matched up with another sensor for intercalibration even more sensitivity is available for detection of cross-track biases. Two primary algorithms are applied for intercalibration: One uses atmospheric profiles derived from a weather forecast analysis and the other retrieves a water vapor profile from SAPHIR. Fundamentally, the two methods only differ in the choice of the water vapor data base. In both cases each member of the database is used to compute brightness temperatures for both SAPHIR and the target sensor (eg. AMSU-B, MHS, ATMS or SSM/IS). Some of the passbands of SAPHIR channels include ozone lines. Analysis of the impacts of these lines requires detailed knowledge of the passbands. Typically the impacts are of the order of a few tenths of a Kelvin. The use of multiple approaches provides confidence and quantitative uncertainty estimates for the intercalibration. These methods are shown to provide sufficient accuracy for precipitation retrieval purposes...|$|E
40|$|Spectral band {{differences}} between sensors can complicate the process <b>of</b> <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> a visible <b>sensor</b> against a reference sensor. This can be best addressed {{by using a}} hyperspectral reference sensor whenever possible {{because they can be}} used to accurately mitigate the band differences. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using operational Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) large-footprint hyperspectral radiances to calibrate geostationary Earth-observing (GEO) sensors. Near simultaneous nadir overpass measurements were used to compare the temporal calibration of SCIAMACHY with Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer band radiances, which were found to be consistent to within 0. 44 % over seven years. An operational SCIAMACHY/GEO ray-matching technique was presented, along with enhancements to improve radiance pair sampling. These enhancements did not bias the underlying intercalibration and provided enough sampling to allow up to monthly monitoring <b>of</b> the GEO <b>sensor</b> degradation. The results <b>of</b> the SCIAMACHY/GEO <b>intercalibration</b> were compared with other operational four-year Meteosat- 9 0. 65 -m calibration coefficients and were found to be within 1 % of the gain, and more importantly, it had one of the lowest temporal standard errors of all the methods. This is more than likely that the GEO spectral response function could be directly applied to the SCIAMACHY radiances, whereas the other operational methods inferred a spectral correction factor. This method allows the validation of the spectral corrections required by other methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission was recommended by the National Research Council in 2007 to provide an on-orbit intercalibration standard with accuracy of 0. 3 % (k = 2) for relevant Earth observing <b>sensors.</b> The goal <b>of</b> reference <b>intercalibration,</b> as established in the Decadal Survey, is to enable rigorous high-accuracy observations of critical climate change parameters, including reflected broadband radiation [Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) ], cloud properties [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ], and changes in surface albedo, including snow and ice albedo feedback. In this paper, we describe the CLARREO approach for performing intercalibration on orbit in the reflected solar (RS) wavelength domain. It is based on providing highly accurate spectral reflectance and reflected radiance measurements from the CLARREO Reflected Solar Spectrometer (RSS) to establish an on-orbit reference for existing sensors, namely, CERES and VIIRS on Joint Polar Satellite System satellites, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and follow-on imagers on MetOp, Landsat imagers, and imagers on geostationary platforms. One of two fundamental CLARREO mission goals is to provide sufficient sampling of high-accuracy observations that are matched in time, space, and viewing angles with measurements made by existing instruments, {{to a degree that}} overcomes the random error sources from imperfect data matching and instrument noise. The data matching is achieved through CLARREO RSS pointing operations on orbit that align its line of sight with the intercalibrated sensor. These operations must be planned in advance; therefore, intercalibration events must be predicted by orbital modeling. If two competing opportunities are identified, one target sensor must be given priority over the other. The intercalibration method is to monitor changes in targeted sensor response function parameters: effective offset, gain, nonlinearity, optics spectral response, and sensitivity to polarization. In this paper, we use existing satellite data and orbital simulationmethods to determinemission requirements for CLARREO, its instrument pointing ability, methodology, and needed intercalibration sampling and data matching for accurate <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> RS radiation <b>sensors</b> on orbit...|$|R

40|$|According to {{requirements}} for <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> assessment methods of vegetation quality elements along the North East Atlantic region, {{within the scope}} of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), a better classification system of coastal regions is needed. To accomplish that goal, a quantitative classification approach was launched in order to establish common typologies for assessment of this biological quality element. This was preliminarily based on a physical classification of the coastal waters that included two consecutive steps, a first one devoted to the establishment of "biotypes" (large areas), and a latter one dealing with recognition of the variability within biotypes ("subtypological variants"). The NEA region coastline was subdivided into 550 consecutive stretches (40 km long). Then, physical variables (sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, wave exposure, tidal range and salinity) were calculated in reference points of each stretch, 5 km from the coast. This information was based mostly on satellite acquired data, using specific procedures proposed in this work. Physical typologies of NEA coastal waters were obtained by statistical analyses. Five different biotypes were selected (i. e. coastal sectors of the European coast) by national experts as baseline information to be used on <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> assessment methods for vegetation within the WFD. Variability of environmental conditions on those biotypes was also analyzed and compared with previous classifications carried out at the national scale.

For macroinvertebrates, a number of metrics developed for rivers turned out to be less useful to describe lake responses to eutrophication and acidification, whereas other species based indicators were more promising. All the biological elements showed different responses in different lake types according to alkalinity and humic substances, and also partly according to depth. Better harmonisation of monitoring methods is needed to achieve better precision in the dose–response curves. Future research should include impacts of hydromorphological pressures and climate change, as well as predictions of timelags involved in responses to reduction of pressures. ...|$|R
40|$|Validation of the AZTI's Fish Index (AFI), {{proposed}} for the Basque Country (northern Spain), in assessing fish quality within the Water Framework Directive (WFD), is undertaken. The response to anthropogenic pressure is investigated, in setting the boundaries between the different quality status classes. Hence, 12 estuaries were sampled, at different frequencies, between 1989 and 2007, {{by means of a}} beam trawl. Significant (p p < 0. 009) negative correlation with AFI, explaining between 51 and 62 % of the variability in fish quality. The impact of pressures upon fish and demersal assemblages is detected as required by the WFD. Nonetheless, further investigation and <b>intercalibration</b> <b>of</b> the methods used, are necessary...|$|R
