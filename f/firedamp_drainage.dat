However the <b>firedamp</b> <b>drainage</b> network is not equipped in the same way. Checks are usually done manually using portable Instruments. As parameters change, the System is manually regulated using valves located Undergroun...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{recent developments}} {{in the use of}} a CFD model for representing the flow of gases in the goaf of retreat faces. In France, it is of highest importance to optimize <b>firedamp</b> <b>drainage</b> in very gassy mines and nitrogen injection in faces prone to spontaneous combustion. Numerical modeling has been used to solve this problem. So the model developed has been first calibrated using a large quantity of field data and could then be used for various simulations. Though still in progress, this research has given promising results, many of them being already set into practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{retreating}} faces, dilution of firedamp flowing {{out of the}} goaf area at {{the junction}} of face and retum roadway is problematic. Despite important flowrates and high CH 4 drainage efficiencies, {{it has been observed}} that 2 / 3 of firedamp evacuated by the air stream concentrate in this particular place. So Ã¤s to progress in preventing such difficulties, it is necessary to better understand the repartition of gas fluxes in the goaf. This has obviously a benefit on <b>firedamp</b> <b>drainage</b> efficiency, but also on the choice of nitrogen injection points and flowrates in case of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. The use of a CFD code, PHOENICS, has allowed Simulation of circulation of three gases : air, CH 4, and N 2. Influence of the face dip on the repartition of CH 4 patterns in the goaf area has been qualitatively demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|In HBL (Lorraine coalfield), {{large amounts}} of air are used in order to dilute methane in retreat coalfaces. A {{parasite}} flow of air exists in the goaf, leading {{to the risk of}} spontaneous combustion of remaining coal as well as to a diminution of <b>firedamp</b> <b>drainage</b> efficiency. The evaluation of various means for reducing this flow has been done through the use of models : a physical model and a numerical model based on a CFD package. The efficiency on air leakage reduction, decrease of methane concentration in the air return or increase of methane concentration of drainage has been quantified for one or more stoppings set up in the abandoned gates or for their backfilling. The influence is small but positive as regards drainage efficiency improvement but almost zero on risk mitigation of spontaneous combustion in the goaf...|$|E
