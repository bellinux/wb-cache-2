40|$|Our {{purpose in}} this chapter is to {{describe}} Reconnecting Youth, an <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> program. Currently prevention scientists use a relatively new "public health model " of prevention, proposed by Gordon (1987) and adopted by the Institute of Medicine (1994). This new model includes universal, selective and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> approaches. Each type of preventive intervention has a different focus and mission. And moving along the continuum from universal to <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> programs, the "dose " of the preventive interventions increases {{in response to the}} level of risk, from low to high. • Universal prevention programs are designed to reach everyone in school. The missions are to prevent students from initiating drug use and to keep a school drug-free. • Selective prevention programs are for at-risk groups know to be at greater risk for drug involvement, and thus, needing to be identified. The mission is to prevent the onset of drug use in such groups. Typically this means having separate programs for the youth in the schools or community. • <b>Indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> programs are for high-risk individuals, who already show sign...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} studies in Australia {{have found that}} adolescent mental health issues are an important public health problem (Sawyer et al., 2001). These problems are often manifested in the classroom. As many as one in five Australian children aged from 4 to 17 have significant mental health concerns (Zubrick, Silburn, Burton, & Blair, 2000). However, only one in four {{of these young people}} receive professional help (Sawyer et al., 2001). To assist in preventing these problems, schools in Australia have been trialling innovative strategies in mental health promotion, prevention and intervention such as the Gatehouse Project and MindMatters.

Blinded interviewers conducted assessments at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The main outcome measure was the incidence of major depression and the secondary outcomes were compliance with treatment, depressive symptoms, emotional distress and caregiver burden. Results At the 12 -month follow-up, a lower incidence of depression as evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders of the DSM-IV was found in the intervention group compared with the control group (10. 1 % v. 25. 0 %).

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{during pregnancy}} can have numerous adverse health {{consequences for the}} developing fetus, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and alcohol-related effects, and therefore is a significant public health problem. A variety of programs {{have been developed to}} prevent drinking during pregnancy and the resulting health problems. Some of these efforts, such as public service announcements and beverage warning labels, are universal and strive to increase the public’s knowledge about FAS. Selective prevention approaches target women of reproductive age who drink alcohol. Such approaches may involve screening all pregnant women for alcohol consumption and counseling those women who do drink. <b>Indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> approaches target high-risk women (e. g., women who have previously abused alcohol or have had a child with FAS or other alcohol-related effects) and typically offer repeated counseling over several years.

40|$|Preventive {{strategies}} {{can be divided}} into universal, selective and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> and early intervention. Universal interventions are directed to the general population. Selective approaches are targeted at people who have risk factors for an illness, but who do not show any current signs. Indicated approaches target high risk individuals with minimal signs or symptoms foreshadowing mental disorder, but who do not meet diagnostic levels at the current time. Early intervention involves treating those with already diagnosable disorder in a timely and optimal manner aiming to decrease the severity of the illness, and reduce secondary morbidity. Although universal and selective interventions are not yet viable strategies, <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> and early intervention are now realistic possibilities in schizophrenia. Development of methods to identify those at risk of psychosis continues to evolve. Promising results in the prevention and delay of transition to psychotic disorder from high risk state have been found. Early intervention in schizophrenia, including promotion of early help-seeking, has been shown to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis, which is known to be associated with poor outcome in schizophrenia. Early intervention programmes which optimise the care of the first episode have been shown to produce better outcomes than routine management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|E

40|$|Childhood {{anxiety is}} a problem {{not only because of}} its {{negative}} consequences on the well-being of children but also because of its adverse effects on society and its role in mental disorders later in life. Adequate prevention might be the key in tackling this problem. The effectiveness of Coping Cat, as an indicated CBT-based prevention program in Dutch primary school children, was assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. In total, 141 children aged 7 - 13 with elevated levels of anxiety and their mothers were included and randomly assigned to an intervention group and a waiting list control group. After screening, all participants completed baseline, post-intervention, and 3 -month follow-up assessments. The results showed that Coping Cat, as an <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> program, reduces children's self-reported anxiety symptoms, with Cohen’s effect size d of 0. 66 at the 3 -month follow-up. A moderating effect was found for baseline anxiety level; specifically, children with high levels of baseline anxiety who received the Coping Cat program had lower anxiety levels at follow-up compared to children with high levels of anxiety in the control condition. No moderating effects of gender or age were found. An unexpected decline in anxiety levels from screening to pre-assessment was found in both groups, and this decline was stronger in the experimental group. These promising results warrant the implementation of Coping Cat as an <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> program...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2016. Aims. School-based {{psychological}} interventions encompass: universal interventions targeting {{youth in}} the general population; and indicated interventions targeting youth with subthreshold depression. This study aimed to: (1) examine the population cost-effectiveness of delivering universal and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions to {{youth in the}} population aged 11 - 17 years via primary and secondary schools in Australia; and (2) compare the comparative cost-effectiveness of delivering these interventions using face-to-face and internet-based delivery mechanisms. Methods. We reviewed literature on the prevention of depression to identify all interventions targeting youth that would be suitable for implementation in Australia and had evidence of efficacy to support analysis. From this, we found evidence of effectiveness for the following intervention types: universal prevention involving group-based psychological interventions delivered to all participating school students; and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention</b> involving group-based psychological interventions delivered to students with subthreshold depression. We constructed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of delivering universal and indicated interventions in the population relative to a 'no intervention' comparator over a 10 -year time horizon. A disease model was used to simulate epidemiological transitions between three health states (i. e., healthy, diseased and dead). Intervention effect sizes were based on meta-analyses of randomised control trial data identified in the aforementioned review; while health benefits were measured as Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted attributable to reductions in depression incidence. Net costs of delivering interventions were calculated using relevant Australian data. Uncertainty and sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} test model assumptions. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured in 2013 Australian dollars per DALY averted; with costs and benefits discounted at 3 %. Results. Universal and indicated psychological interventions delivered through face-to-face modalities had ICERs below a threshold of 50 000 per DALY averted. That is, 7350 per DALY averted (95 % uncertainty interval (UI) : dominates - 23 070) for universal prevention, and 19 550 per DALY averted (95 % UI: 3081 - 56 713) for <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention.</b> Baseline ICERs were generally robust to changes in model assumptions. We conducted a sensitivity analysis which found that internet-delivered prevention interventions were highly cost-effective when assuming intervention effect sizes of 100 and 50 % relative to effect sizes observed for face-to-face delivered interventions. These results should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the paucity of data. Conclusions. School-based psychological interventions appear to be cost-effective. However, realising efficiency gains in the population is ultimately dependent on ensuring successful system-level implementation...|$|E

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Educational Research Information Centre (ERIC), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published between 1995 and 2013. Results were described separately for different outcomes (marijuana vs. other illicit drugs) and intervention types (universal, selective, and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention).</b> Meta-analyses were performed when data were sufficient (e. g., marijuana and other illicit drug initiation in universal samples), using random effect models. Otherwise, we provided narrative reviews (e. g., regarding selective and <b>indicated</b> <b>prevention).</b> Thirty-nine papers describing 22 RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Universal family interventions targeting parent-child dyads {{are likely to be}} effective in preventing (OR 0. 72; 95 % CI 0. 56, 0. 94) and reducing adolescent marijuana use, but not in preventing other illicit drugs (OR 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 60, 1. 34). Among high-risk groups, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of family interventions in preventing and reducing illicit drug use and drug disorders. The three small RCTs among substance-(ab) using adolescents gave some indication that programs might reduce the frequency of illicit drug use. Family interventions targeting parent-child dyads are likely to be effective in preventing and reducing adolescent marijuana use in general populations, but no evidence for other illicit drug use was found.
