The present work describes a comparison between the uncertainty evaluation carried out according to the GUM uncertainty framework and the Monte Carlo (MC) method. This comparison was carried out starting from real data sets obtained from the quantification of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), spiked on filters commonly used for airborne particulate matter sampling. BaP was chosen as target analyte as it is listed in the current European legislation as marker of the carcinogenic risk for the whole class of PAHs.

In the case under study, it was observed that the two approaches for the uncertainty evaluation provide different results for BaP masses in samples containing different masses of the analyte, MC method giving larger coverage intervals. In addition, in cases of analyte masses close to zero, the GUM uncertainty framework would give even negative lower limit of uncertainty coverage interval <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurand,</b> an unphysical result which is avoided when using MC method.

The diagnostic criteria and prognostic value <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurands</b> were defined. Results: Plasma and serum TIMP- 1, MMP- 9 and CEA were significantly higher in GC patients compared with healthy controls. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0. 961), diagnostic sensitivity (89 %) and accuracy (91 %) of plasma TIMP- 1 were higher than those for MMP- 9 and CEA.

40|$|In metrology, {{measurement}} uncertainty {{is understood as}} a range in which the true value of the measurement is likely to fall in. The recent years have seen a rapid development in evaluation of {{measurement uncertainty}}. ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM 1995) is the primary guiding document for measurement uncertainty. More recently, the Supplement 1 to the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement " – Propagation of distributions using a Monte Carlo method (GUM SP 1) was published in November 2008. A number of software tools for measurement uncertainty have been developed and made available based on these two documents. The current software tools are mainly desktop applications utilising numeric computation with limited mathematical model handling capacity. A novel and generic web-based application, web-based Knowledge-Based Decision Support System (KB-DSS), has been proposed and developed in this research for measurement uncertainty evaluation. A Model-View-Controller architecture pattern {{is used for the}} proposed system. Under this general architecture, a web-based KB-DSS is developed based on an integration of the Expert System and Decision Support System approach. In the proposed uncertainty evaluation system, three knowledge bases as sub-systems are developed to implement the evaluation for measurement uncertainty.

40|$|Measurement of Quality of Service (QoS) {{parameters}} is {{a relevant}} task in communication networks. Similarly to other contexts, the measurement result {{has to be}} completed with the related uncertainty {{in order to provide}} information about the signiﬁcance and reliabil- ity of the overall measurement process. This aspect is particularly crucial in communica- tion networks. In fact, the measured values of QoS parameters have often to be compared against suitable thresholds to check their compliance with required quality con- straints (QoS levels delivered to the user are generally offered for a fee) or to reliably verify the effect of new services conveyed by the network on its performance. Nevertheless, uncertainty estimation in QoS parameters measurement is still an open issue. Most literature concerning communication and computer networks test and mea- surement clearly evidences the lack of the advisable practice of uncertainty evaluation in QoS parameters measurement according to the guide for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM). In addition, it is worth emphasizing that uncertainty modeling and evaluation in QoS parameters measurement are not trivial tasks because several aspects are involved in a QoS measurement process. All these aspects {{can be thought of as}} sources of measurement uncertainty, capable of signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the reliability of measurement results.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} results of a proficiency test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> determination of total bromine and several polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl ethers (PBB and PBDE) in plastic. The test material used is a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) granulate fortified with a mixture of PBB and PBDE. Up to twenty laboratories from 15 countries registered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exercise and reported results. Homogeneity and stability were investigated to asses the adequacy of the selected test material. Laboratory results were rated with z and zeta scores according to ISO 13528. <b>The</b> standard deviation <b>for</b> proficiency assessment was set to 25 % of the assigned values. This exercise highlights the difficulties laboratories have to provide consistent values <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investigated <b>measurands.</b> Many participants reported underestimated measurand values; satisfactory z scores ranged from 61 to 88 %. The critical experimental parameters are identified and discussed. JRC. D. 5 -Standards for Food Bioscienc...|$|R
50|$|Another {{basic premise}} of the GUM {{approach}} {{is that it is}} not possible to state how well the true value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> is known, but only how well it is believed to be known. Measurement uncertainty can therefore be described as a measure of how well one believes one knows the true value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand.</b> This uncertainty reflects the incomplete knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>measurand.</b>|$|R

In total 10 participants {{took part in}} the intercomparison. In total 68 % of the participants reported satisfactory results, when deviation of 20 – 30 % from the assigned value was accepted. The calculated values were used as <b>the</b> assigned values <b>for</b> <b>the</b> synthetic sample <b>for</b> <b>the</b> results reported as compound specific responses. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> other <b>measurands</b> and samples <b>the</b> average {{of the results of the}} homogeneity measurements and the test results of the expert laboratory were used as the assigned value. The evaluation was based on the z scores. Warm thanks to all the participants of this interlaboratory comparison...|$|R
50|$|The above {{discussion}} {{concerns the}} direct measurement of a quantity, which incidentally occurs rarely. <b>For</b> example, <b>the</b> bathroom scale may convert a measured extension of a spring into {{an estimate of}} <b>the</b> <b>measurand,</b> <b>the</b> mass of {{the person on the}} scale. The particular relationship between extension and mass is determined by the calibration of the scale. A measurement model converts a quantity value into the corresponding value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{task is to}} {{conclude}} the unknown value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> from <b>the</b> observed outcome of the measurement process. It is impossible to determine the true value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> {{by means of the}} measurement process because of randomness. It is only possible to specify a set of values that includes the true value. Such a set constitutes the measurement result and it is called [...] "correct" [...] if it contains the true value of <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> and wrong if not.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of uncertainty analysis of complex measurement systems with multiple axis motions and a measurand defined by non-linear combinations of input quantities. We demonstrate a method <b>for</b> obtaining <b>the</b> definition of <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> using Homogeneous Transformation Matrices (HTM) to model the instrument and obtain <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> {{as a function of}} the motion and sensing errors of the individual axes. The method is demonstrated by application to the laser ball bar (LBB), which is capable of measurement of spatial coordinates of a target over relatively large working volumes approaching 1 m 3. The first step in performing measurement uncertainty analyses is the definition of <b>the</b> <b>measurand,</b> or quantity being measured. In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>measurand</b> is not observed directly but is a mathematical function of other input quantities. The computation of measurement uncertainty from the uncertainties of the input quantities is then a relatively straightforwar...|$|R
