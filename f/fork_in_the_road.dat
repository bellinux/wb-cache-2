5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E

5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at a <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road {{became known as the}} Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E

2500|$|Barringer's Confederate cavalry {{had bought}} {{enough time for}} Bushrod Johnson's {{infantry}} division to pass nearby Namozine Church around 8:00a.m. Unfortunately for Johnson, his forces took a wrong turn at a <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and had to halt when his command reached a bridge over Deep Creek that was underwater from recent flooding. Although the Union cavalry drove off the Confederate cavalry, the North Carolina cavalry regiments had secured the Namozine Church road intersection long enough for Johnson to return and take the correct fork. When General Johnson approached with his infantry division, Custer's forces were forced to retire, allowing the Confederate forces to proceed across Deep Creek, an Appomattox River tributary. Then, Fitzhugh Lee and his cousin, [...] "Rooney" [...] Lee, second son of Gen. Robert E. Lee, separated their cavalry commands and continued their retreat. Custer later chased the fleeing Confederates but near dark he ran into substantial infantry opposition from Johnson's division at Sweathouse Creek and halted for the night. After dark, however, Wells's brigade continued to attack Fitzhugh Lee's force along Deep Creek. Brig. Gen. Barringer {{and many of his}} men were captured by Sheridan's scouts who were wearing gray uniforms and who led Barringer and his remaining men into a trap. Rooney Lee's adjutant general, Maj. J. D.

5000|$|OutRunners is <b>the</b> fourth game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Out Run series, {{following}} Battle Out Run and Turbo Outrun. After Turbo Outruns {{departure from}} Out Runs laid-back, charming atmosphere, fans wanted {{a game that}} captured {{the spirit of the}} original. OutRunners succeeded in doing this; it brought back the ability to take different paths through <b>forks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> returned to a lighthearted atmosphere, and distanced itself well from the [...] "serious" [...] Turbo Outrun. The game featured head-to-head support, and with enough cabinets, up to eight players could challenge each other. It was also <b>the</b> only game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Out Run series to feature various selectable cars and multiple endings until OutRun 2. OutRunners was the most successful game released for Sega's System Multi 32 hardware, and one of the last successful 2D games released by Sega. OutRunners was also known for having some of the best looking graphics seen at the time, thanks to creative sprite design and a very skillful use of parallax scrolling, similar to that found in Power Drift, released four years earlier. The game holds up very well today, and plays very similarly to a modern polygon based 3D racer, something not common in a racing game that utilises 2D graphics.|$|R
2500|$|After {{softening}} up {{the rebel}} positions, Heintzelman {{took the initiative}} by dismounting the rangers and sending them forward to attack one of the enemy's flanks while the infantry and cavalry attacked the other. In the meantime, the artillery would hold the road along the river, {{in the center of}} the battlefield. Neither of the movements made very much progress though. Not just because of incoming fire but because of how thick the prairie was. As the advance slowed, the Cortinistas launched an attack of their own, hoping to capture the American artillery. However, the Americans repulsed the attack with musketry and afterwards found eight dead rebels on the field. One Texas Ranger was killed during the engagement while two others were wounded. Two soldiers also received wounds. When the fighting ceased, Major Heintzelman ordered his men to regroup and rest for two hours before continuing further down the road. The rebels made another stand a short distance away from La Ebonal and yet another four miles up the road that leads to Edinburg and Rio Grande City, at the ranch of Jesus de Leon. During the latter engagement, both the rangers and the soldiers routed the Cortinistas, most of whom fled further up the river while others crossed over to Mexico. One more ranger was mortally wounded while a second was badly wounded in the shoulder due to an accidental discharge. Heintzelman reported that he counted eight more dead Mexicans as he rode up to the De Leon Ranch but overall casualties were difficult to determine because many of the rebels were literally [...] "blown to pieces" [...] by artillery fire. After another halt, the expedition continued on. At a <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> near Cortina's Rancho San Jose, fifteen miles from Brownsville, the Americans found a path leading through the chaparral where the rebels had dragged one of their cannons. The rain was starting to get heavier though so Heintzelmen decided to make camp for the night and follow the path on the next morning.|$|E

50|$|Burai Fighter is {{a single}} player two {{dimensional}} automatic sidescroller. It has three difficulty levels to choose from. At the start, the screen moves from left to right, but it can move in all four directions and even change directions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same level. The player is expected to keep up, because getting stuck on the edge means you die. You {{start out with a}} basic gun that you can fire in all eight directions. You can hold the fire button to lock your firing position. You float through space blowing up robots that sort of look like animals most of the time. At the end of a level you must defeat a boss to continue to the next level. At times, you may find a gap {{at the side of the}} screen. If you time it right and push <b>in</b> that direction, <b>the</b> orientation of the screen will change and take you into a secret room with some power ups. However, the higher difficulty levels have fewer secret rooms and your timing also needs to be perfect. This means you can quite simply walk into a death trap. The game is fairly linear otherwise, but there are a few <b>forks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> where you can either travel on the left side or the right side of the screen for a little while. If you pick the wrong side, you need to be an exceptionally skilled player to make it out of there.|$|R
