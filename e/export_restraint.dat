40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conjectural variation approach {{to examine the}} conditions under which voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> are voluntary. Th e authors have shown that the value of the conjectural variation is a critical factor for determining the effects of voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints.</b> In particular, if the free trade equilibrium is more collusive than Cournot, the imposition of voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> at the free trade level of imports leads to a reduction in the profit of the foreign firm. Unde r such circumstances, voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> are "involuntary," which is contrary to R. Harris's (1985) assertion. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reexamines why {{voluntary}} <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> are voluntary. It {{is shown}} that the results depend crucially on whether domestic goods and imports are regarded as strategic substitutes or strategic complements. This, in turn, depends on the following conditions: {{the form of the}} demand and the cost functions, and the nature of quantity competition. In particular, with linear demands and constant marginal costs, voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> are voluntary; they are not involuntary. ...|$|R

Voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> are shown to be bad for the exporting country, contradicting recent results in the literature by R. Harris (1985) and K. Krishna (1989). Voluntary import expansions are shown to decrease competition. Cases are analyzed where voluntary import expansions may actually lead to import contraction or to increases in efficiency in the home country. ...|$|R
50|$|Stewart {{represented}} domestic steel {{producers in}} a series of trade remedy cases that redefined U.S. countervailing duty law practice and that resulted in voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> agreements. In 1982, Stewart filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions for a major U.S. producer. These petitions were part {{of a large number of}} trade remedy cases brought by three groups of domestic steel producers at the same time. The petitions resulted in 93 preliminary countervailing duty and antidumping investigations involving 9 steel product lines from 9 countries. The petitions were delivered in 494 boxes, contained an estimated 3 million pages and concerned imported carbon steel products with an estimated value of more than $1 billion. The petitions were later withdrawn in 1982 after the United States and the European Community reached an agreement limiting steel imports for three years. The agreement was later expanded in product coverage and extended through September 1989, and subsequently extended through March 1992.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} competing exporters to move simultaneously or sequentially when a voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> has introduced both asymmetry and uncertainty amongst them. A restrained and an unrestrained exporter choose price strategically under {{the threat of a}} voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> on the latter. Given the choice, firms adopt a sequential move strategy, but which "leads" and which "follows" depends upon the threat of the second voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint.</b> The restricted firm, thus, sells its full quota, even if this threat is low.

40|$|When {{exporting}} firms {{face the}} prospect of voluntary export restraints, they have an incentive to export more than with no prospect of a voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint,</b> since greater exports lead to larger license allocations {{in the event of a}} voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint.</b> Export-country governments' incentives differ, leading either to export tax or subsidy, depending on the circumstances. The prospect of one departure from free trade, thus, leads to another, a domino effect. Antidumping enforcement will ordinarily not eliminate and ironically may increase dumping.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{believes}} that voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> (VERs) are beneficial for {{the exporting country}} but detrimental to the importing country. Based on the benchmark model of Obstfeld and Rogoff, this paper aims to examine this belief and evaluate the welfare effects of VERs on the world economy. Analytical results find that VERs exert expansion effects on the exporting economy temporarily. The conventional view of VERs effects holds only when there is perfect competition on the goods market or when the exporting country is bigger than the importing country. On the whole, VERs deteriorate the overall welfare of the world economy. welfare effects, voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints,</b> country sizes...|$|R
40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that tariffs are welfare-superior to voluntary export restraints {{in the presence of}} perfect competition. However, with perfectly competitive markets, some authors have found that voluntary export restraints may be welfare superior to tariffs. The authors reconsider the comparison between a voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> and a tariff in the context of GATT-based constraints. Using a model of perfect competition, the authors show that a voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> can welfare-dominate a tariff increase that is accompanied by a compensatory reduction in the tariff on another good or if the tariff is matched with a retaliatory tariff on domestic exports. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{a partial}} {{equilibrium}} analysis {{to show that}} a partial trade liberalization may reduce a country's welfare due to a loss in monopolistic rent if it is carried out by a quota.

The quota rents {{in the case of a}} voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> are captured by the foreign agent. Therefore, the reduction in the domestic country's welfare is more likely in this case rather than in the case of the quota set by the domestic government.

40|$|Voluntary <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> allow {{exporters}} {{to increase}} the prices they charge importers for supplying goods. This paper quantifies this effect for the UK restrictions on imports of footwear imposed in the later 1970 's, by isolating changes in the relative prices of exports to the UK and to other markets. Where exporters appear to have little ability to switch supplies between markets the comparisons are made after allowing for movements in real exchange rates. Where, on the other hand, exporters can substitute easily between markets, the comparisons refer to nominal prices. VERs increased UK footwear import prices by 15 %- 25 % for the major restricted suppliers and in 1980 cost the UK economy at least 25 million pounds.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} voluntary export restraints (VERs) in an international duopoly modelled as a di¤erential game. We employ two well known capital accumulation dynamics for …rms, due to Nerlove and Arrow and to Ramsey, respectively. First we investigate Cournot behaviour, showing that, in both models, a VERs cannot be ‘voluntarily ’ employed by the foreign …rm. Our analysis therefore suggests that the empirical observation of VERs corresponds to their use either as coordinating or as quasi-collusive devices in markets where …rms are price setters and sales are not capacity-constrained. This is con…rmed by our analysis of price competition. The Bertrand steady state of the Solow-Nerlove-Arrow model coincides with the Cournot equilibrium, and therefore the foreign …rm cannot be expected to voluntarily adopt an <b>export</b> <b>restraint.</b> However, the opposite holds {{in the case of}} price behaviour in the Ramsey setting, where the adoption of an <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> may increase the pro…ts of both …rms...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{selective}} {{survey of the}} work on the effects of <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> with imperfect competition. Although {{there are a number of}} excellent surveys of strategic trade theory as a whole. not much attention is paid in these to the effects of <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> per se. The large and growing literature in this area is explicitly game theoretic and contains a wide variety of models which often yield different results. For this reason. the literature in this area can be difficult to follow. This survey provides a stylized overview of the area which serves as a guide to the work. Short run effects are contrasted to long run effects. The short run effects usually studied are on pricing behavior. Long run effects are multidimensional. These include effects on quality choice and investment which often work in the opposite direction to the short run effects. ...|$|R

Not only some major Japanese electronics companies like Matsushita, SONY and so on, but also a lot of SMEs played a very important roll to open up its American Market. In its early stage, Japanese companies had an advantage of price competition over American companies, but were criticized itsf poor-quality. To improve it, MITI imposed an <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> which gave favorable allotment to exporters which was dealing high quality goods and had a long term and exclusive contract with American importers. Middle class companies which was at a disadvantage against big companies in past export record utilized the system to secure their quota and was strongly motivated to improve their product. On the other hand, the companies shipping low quality goods had to leave the market. Consequently, by the middle of 1960 fs, the industry was reorganized.

40|$|<b>Export</b> <b>restraints</b> by the Russian Federation {{on natural}} gas and timber have {{been the source of}} major {{controversy}} between the European Union and the Russian Federation. The analysis of this paper suggests that the <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> in natural gas very substantially benefit Russia. On the other hand, in raw timber the analysis suggests that a substantial reduction of Russian export taxes would increase Russian welfare. The paper explains that Gazprom has failed to invest adequately, resulting in little development of new gas supplies. The result has been progressively increasing use by Gazprom of Central Asian gas supplies, at progressively higher prices for Russia. The increased prices of gas for Russian consumers have shown that it is crucial for Russia to allow new entrants and to introduce competition in the Russian domestic market. Without <b>export</b> <b>restraints,</b> however, competition among multiple gas suppliers from Russia would erode or eliminate the monopoly profits of the Russian Federation on gas exports. Thus, with a more competitive domestic market, the Russian government would be expected to grant exclusive exporting rights to a single entity (as it presently does with Gazprom) or impose export taxes. Thus, Europe should not expect to achieve cheaper Russian gas as a result of structural reforms within the Russian gas market. A more promising avenue for European energy diversification is new pipeline construction to open up new sources of supply independent of Russia (especially the Nabucco pipeline), and liquefied natural gas purchases.
