5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued.

In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification <b>is</b> <b>issued</b> and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he <b>is</b> <b>issued</b> an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory <b>is</b> <b>issued</b> for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E
