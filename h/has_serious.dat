5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

Hormone replacement therapy does not always reduce the adverse effects.|$|E

30|$|Beginning in the 2008 June CPS, the {{respondents}} were asked the following six questions on disability: (i) whether they have difficulty dressing or bathing; (ii) whether they are deaf or <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty hearing; (iii) whether they are blind or <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses; (iv) whether they have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition; (v) whether they <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty walking or climbing stairs; and (vi) whether they <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. Since the ATUS sample is drawn from {{those who participated in}} the CPS, the responses to these questions are available for all ATUS WB respondents. Freedman et al. (2012) show that regardless of measures of subjective well-being, older married adults with disability reported worse subjective well-being than those without disability.|$|R

Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion.

It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatments}} for throat cancer {{can also be}} harmful to the digestive system {{as well as other}} body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.|$|E

The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following the umbilical. Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by {{the length of the}} umbilical, and it may snag on obstructions.|$|E

Macy), who <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law will pay the ransom. His plan goes wrong when the kidnappers deviate from the plan and local cop Marge Gunderson (McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million, Fargo was a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand's performance. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA award and Cannes award for direction, and two Oscars: a Best Original Screenplay and a Best Actress Oscar for McDormand.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, although not without some initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman he kissed on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become more comfortable in dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room. Early in season 10, the couple is very happy to be finally living alone after Sheldon moves in with Amy.|$|E
25|$|Most Indians {{depend on}} on-site {{sanitation}} facilities which means mainly pit latrines in rural areas. In rural areas, {{the government has}} been promoting community-led sanitation approaches such as the Total Sanitation Campaign, with some success. In urban areas, a good practice example is the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai that has provided access to sanitation for a quarter million slum dwellers. Sewerage, where available, is often in a bad state. In Delhi the sewerage network has lacked maintenance over the years and overflow of raw sewage in open drains is common, due to blockage, settlements and inadequate pumping capacities. The capacity of the 17 existing wastewater treatment plants in Delhi is adequate to cater a daily production of waste water of less than 50% of the drinking water produced. Of the 2.5billion people in the world that defecate openly, some 665million live in India, making it the country with the highest number of people who defecate in the open. This <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> public health implications.|$|E

25|$|The {{main river}} in the area is the Laja, which crosses {{from north to south}} before finally {{emptying}} in the Lerma River in the municipality of Salamanca. The river currently <b>has</b> <b>serious</b> pollution issues because it is used for discharge of wastewater without prior treatment. Most of this discharge is from the residential areas of San Miguel and Dolores Hidalgo. In addition to the river, there are four principal arroyos that pass by the municipal seal, the La Cañadita, El Atascadero, Las Cachinches and El Obraje. The last receives most of the area’s runoff during the rainy season which feeds the Las Colonias and El Obraje dams. The most important dam in the area is the Ignacio Allende dam, located in the west of the municipality. While this dam controls flooding along the Laja River, local residents say that the water collected in its reservoir goes to the area around Guadalajara, far to the west of San Miguel, due to the provisions of the federal act creating the dam and reservoir. Other dams in the area include La Cantera and Bordo Grande located in the south and north of the municipality respectively along with the aforementioned Las Colonias and El Obraje, which are mostly used for irrigation. The municipality also has fresh water, thermal and alkaline springs, many of which are used as ecotourist attractions such as the El Chorro, Montecillo, El Cortijo, Cieneguita, Atotonilco and Taboada spas. One other spa is the El Xoté, which has sulfur-laden waters.|$|E
