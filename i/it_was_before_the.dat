5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa {{simply because it}} was near where he then lived, he has continued {{because of the nature}} of the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were as popular and crowded as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, Kikai says, he would go somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, even though it means {{he will have to}} go back to Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

5|$|The euro is the second-most {{widely held}} reserve {{currency}} after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate {{against the other}} major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With {{the advent of the}} global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable. In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> crisis kicked off in 2007. In late August 2017 € rose again above 1.20 $.It also hit new relative or absolute highs against £ and other currencies.|$|E

25|$|As {{the capital}} city of the Spanish Empire from 1561, Madrid's {{population}} grew rapidly.

25|$|In 1847, the Mineral Point Tribune {{reported}} that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900kg) of lead each day. Lead mining in southwest Wisconsin began to decline after 1848 and 1849 when the combination of less easily accessible lead ore and the California Gold Rush made miners leave the area. The lead mining industry in mining communities such as Mineral Point managed to survive into the 1860s, but the industry was never as prosperous as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> decline.|$|E
25|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the town}} has a total area of 2.8km² (1.1mi²), all land. The area is {{dominated}} by the Mississippi River flood plains, trees and fields. Along and parallel to the Tennessee–Arkansas state line, the former course of the Mississippi River as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes is still visible in the landscape almost 200 years after the events. The former riverbed has shrunk to small side arms of the Mississippi River which, dependent on the water level and precipitation, are still partly connected to the river.|$|E
25|$|San Pablito is {{best known}} for the {{commercial}} production of a bark paper called amate as a handcraft.

25|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1821, Costa Rica had found no regular trade routes for its coffee in European markets. This {{was compounded by}} transportation problems. The coffee-growing areas were located in {{the central part of}} the country and it was impossible, because of the mountains and the rainy forest, to send the coffee to the Caribbean Sea and therefore to the Atlantic. It was much easier to ship the coffee to a Pacific port, Puntarenas, and to sail around Cape Horn to the Atlantic. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean railway from San José to the Caribbean and the Panama Canal were built.|$|E
25|$|Other churches {{include the}} Georgian Holy Trinity Church (now {{converted}} to office use) {{and the late}} neo-Gothic (1911) St. Paul's, King Cross, by Sir Charles Nicholson. St Paul's is notable {{not only for its}} fine acoustics but also for an unusual and highly colourful west window, specified by Nicholson, showing the apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> First World War. The Church of St Jude in Savile Park, designed by local architect William Swinden Barber in 1888, is easily identified by the four large pinnacles on its tower.|$|E
25|$|Around 1300, {{centuries of}} {{prosperity}} and growth in Europe {{came to a}} halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict in the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, {{the unity of the}} Catholic Church was temporarily shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively these events are sometimes called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the overall}} decline of KRON as an independent, its newscasts {{initially}} pulled in respectable ratings though viewership {{was lower than}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> station lost its NBC affiliation. During the February 2004 sweeps period, the station placed second in the ratings behind KTVU. However, KRON's news viewership has gradually fallen since that point; also in 2004, the station posted an 8.7% market share, down from the 21% share it had as an NBC affiliate. The 9 p.m. newscast created after becoming independent eventually fell to fourth place by 2005. In March 2006, KRON's morning newscast posted an average viewership of approximately 28,000 viewers. By 2009, overall viewership for the station's newscasts had fallen to fifth place among the Bay Area's news-producing English-language television stations.|$|E
25|$|During the war two icebreakers, Silachya and Stadt Reval {{had been}} docked by unwilling {{support of a}} yard {{supervisor}} the Red Guards had found and captured. Restarting of the plant had failed largely because the power grid and machinery had been sabotaged before the supervisors had left the yard. When the war was over, the material stock had been looted and {{just a part of}} it was managed to get back. Work in the company was restarted when the situation returned to normal in April. The employees were taken back after each worker's role in the war was carefully investigated. As many of the company workers had taken part in the war in the Red Guards, and amount of orders had dropped, the number of personnel was significantly reduced from the level <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Civil War.|$|E

Although industry is less significant than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten {{percent of the}} total Nantes–Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.|$|E
