5000|$|In the United States, the Fair <b>Credit</b> <b>Reporting</b> Act governs {{businesses}} that compile <b>credit</b> <b>reports.</b> These businesses {{range from the}} big three <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agencies, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, to specialty <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agencies that cater to specific clients including payday lenders, utility companies, casinos, landlords, medical service providers, and employers.

50|$|Like {{the other}} major <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> bureaus, Experian is chiefly {{regulated}} in the United States by the Fair <b>Credit</b> <b>Reporting</b> Act (FCRA). The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, signed into law in 2003, amended the FCRA to require the <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> companies to provide consumers with one free copy of their <b>credit</b> <b>report</b> per 12-month period. Like its main competitors, TransUnion and Equifax, Experian markets <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> directly to consumers.

We first outline the rationale for having a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system through reviewing the literature on asymmetric information.

First we present a case study of a private <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu that was established in 2000. This was the first <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu and one of the earliest in China. Second, we discuss the progress the People’s Bank of China has made in establishing a unified national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system since 2004. It is clear that China has made much progress in developing a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system, already operating the largest <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> database in the world.
