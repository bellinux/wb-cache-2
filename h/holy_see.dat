5|$|The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the <b>Holy</b> <b>See.</b> It is {{as head of the}} <b>Holy</b> <b>See,</b> not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Besides the <b>Holy</b> <b>See,</b> another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. While the coat of arms of the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.|$|E
5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stephen Báthory {{had decided}} to secure the Bishopric of Kraków for his nephew, but the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> did not appoint Andrew coadjutor bishop of the Kraków See, because he was still too young. The king wanted to invade Russia and sent Andrew to Rome to {{convince}} Pope Sixtus V to support his plan. Andrew left Poland on 22 March 1586. Samuel Zborowski's brothers (he had been executed on Stephen Báthory's orders), wanted to capture and murder Andrew, but their plan failed because of a flood. Andrew came to Rome on 24 July. He informed the pope about Stephen Báthory's plan, asking financial support from the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> against Russia.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund III's confessor {{and court}} priest, who were Jesuits, {{supported}} Radziwiłł against Andrew. Thereafter, Andrew urged the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> to send Franciscan friars to Transylvania {{instead of the}} Jesuits (who were supported by Sigismund Báthory). He also suggested that the pope should make a Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania). He settled Catholic priests in four villages on his estates. The <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> authorized him to set up deaneries in Transylvania, making him the actual head of the Catholic Church in the principality.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in communion with the <b>Holy</b> <b>See.</b> These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, Lefebvre {{founded the}} Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) {{as a small}} {{community}} of seminarians {{in the village of}} Écône, Switzerland, with the permission of Bishop François Charrière of Fribourg.

5|$|In 1988, {{against the}} {{expressed}} prohibition of Pope John PaulII, he consecrated four bishops {{to continue his}} work with the SSPX.

5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier {{requested}} this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope's longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the <b>Holy</b> <b>See.</b> Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic of John Paul II.

5|$|In the meantime, the {{citizens}} of Ancona, a town in the Papal States, hoisted Matthias's flag in the hope he would protect them against Venice. Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to reject the overture, stating that the link {{between him and the}} town would never harm the interests of the <b>Holy</b> <b>See.</b> He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the <b>Holy</b> <b>See</b> and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia. The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania.|$|E
