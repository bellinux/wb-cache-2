40|$|NASA has {{developed}} software that enables American industry {{to establish the}} reliability and life of ceramic structures {{in a wide variety}} of 21 st Century applications. Designing ceramic components to survive at higher temperatures than the capability of most metals and in severe loading environments involves the disciplines of statistics and fracture mechanics. Successful application of advanced ceramics material properties and the use of a probabilistic brittle material design methodology. The NASA program, known as CARES (Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures), is a comprehensive general purpose design tool that predicts the probability of failure of a ceramic component as a function of its time in service. The latest version of this software, CARESALIFE, is coupled to several commercially available finite element analysis programs (ANSYS, MSC/NASTRAN, ABAQUS, COSMOS/N 4, MARC), resulting in an advanced integrated design tool which is adapted to the computing environment of the user. The NASA-developed CARES software has been successfully used by industrial, government, and academic organizations to design and optimize ceramic components for many demanding applications. Industrial sectors impacted by this program include aerospace, automotive, electronic, medical, and energy applications. Dual-use applications include engine components, graphite and ceramic high temperature valves, TV picture tubes, ceramic bearings, electronic chips, glass building panels, infrared windows, radiant heater tubes, heat exchangers, and artificial <b>hips,</b> knee <b>caps,</b> and teeth...|$|R
40|$|Radial-velocity {{measurements}} and sine-curve fits to the orbital velocity variations are presented for nine contact binaries, V 1464 Aql, V 759 Cen, DE Oct, MW Pav, BQ Phe, EL Aqr, SX Crv, VZ Lib, GR Vir; {{for the first}} five among these, our observations are the first available radial velocity data. Among three remaining radial velocity variables, CE Hyi is a known visual binary, while CL Cet and V 1084 Sco are suspected to be multiple systems where the contact binary is spectrally dominated by its companion (which itself is a binary in V 1084 Sco).
