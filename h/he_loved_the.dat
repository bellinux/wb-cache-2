5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E

25|$|Bass {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} using a montage of fast cuts and tight framing to render a violent, bloody murder as an impressionistic and nearly bloodless one. Hitchcock felt uncertain about Bass’s conception of the scene fearing that audiences might not accept such a stylized and quickly cut sequence. In an interview with film historian Pat Kirkham, Bass recalled, “Having designed and storyboarded the shower sequence, I showed it to Hitch. He was uneasy about it. It was very un-Hitchcockian in character. He never used that kind of quick cutting; <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> long shot”.|$|E
25|$|Spruance was {{an active}} man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were {{generally}} simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance {{spent most of his}} retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.|$|E

Robert was their only child to survive; a younger son, Richard Henry, {{was born with a}} spinal {{deformity}} and died before his first birthday. Goddard's family had roots in New England dating to the late 1600s. With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. A country boy, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> outdoors and became an excellent marksman with a rifle. On Sundays the family attended an Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.|$|E

25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after {{he grabbed the}} barrel of a prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and he was unable to remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
25|$|Benny {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, {{and grew up in}} nearby Waukegan, Illinois. He was the son of Meyer Kubelsky and Emma Sachs Kubelsky. His parents were Jewish. Meyer was a saloon owner and later a {{haberdasher}} who had emigrated to America from Poland. Emma had emigrated from Lithuania. Benny began studying violin, an instrument that became his trademark, at the age of 6, his parents hoping for him to become a professional violinist. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> instrument, but hated practice. His music teacher was Otto Graham Sr., a neighbor and father of Otto Graham of NFL fame. At 14, Benny was playing in dance bands and his high school orchestra. He was a dreamer and poor at his studies, and was ultimately expelled from high school. He did poorly in business school later and at attempts to join his father's business. In 1911, he began playing the violin in local vaudeville theaters for $7.50 a week. He was joined by Ned Miller, a young composer and singer, on the circuit.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E
