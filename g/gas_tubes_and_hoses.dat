50|$|A Büchner flask, {{also known}} as a vacuum flask, filter flask, suction flask, {{side-arm}} flask or Kitasato flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a short glass <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>hose</b> barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>hose</b> barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner flask.|$|R

50|$|Though marketed {{together}} with the CAR-15, the CMG-1 had few parts in common with it. One CMG-1 used direct impingement and shared the bolt, <b>gas</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> other operating parts of the M16. However, other CMG-1s used gas pistons. The CMG-1s also used the M16's pistol grip, front sight block, and flash hider. Similar to the Stoner 63, the CMG-1 could be fed from either side. The rate of fire was 650 rounds per minute. Only two or three CMG-1s were ever made. Colt made them with sheet-metal stamping.|$|R

50|$|The SPP-1 {{underwater}} pistol {{was accepted}} in 1971, but soon {{proved to be}} useful for close-up self-defence rather than in attacking more distant targets. Vladimir Simonov undertook the job of developing an underwater assault rifle. To allow the rifle's mechanism to work underwater, {{there had to be}} room for the flow of the water pushed aside by moving parts and by the gas produced by the propellant explosive in the cartridge. The APS rifle was accepted for use in the mid-1970s. One special improvement was a perforated <b>gas</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> in the sighting.

25|$|On 3 July in the morning, a {{crack in}} a {{polyvinyl}} hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10AM the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 13:45PM. The temperature in the reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably {{the cause of the}} rupture of the pleated flexible tube. On 4 July TEPCO announced that all <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>hoses</b> used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles. At 10:16 AM on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original Residual Heat Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps <b>and</b> <b>hoses</b> to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45 PM on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the residual heat removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.|$|R

The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces. Among those variants are the SG 551-1P police carbine (designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser), the SG 551 SWAT carbine (coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with {{a wide array of}} sights, and can also accept mission-critical accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light) and the SG 551 LB carbine with an extended [...] barrel that enables the use of rifle grenades and a bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|The AKS-74U {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting system with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: [...] "П" [...] corresponding to a 350 m [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting and [...] "4-5" [...] (used for firing at distances between 400 - 500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded protective enclosure that is riveted to the receiver's spring-loaded top cover. This top cover hinges from the barrel trunnion, pivoting forward when opened, which also works to unlock the <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> cover. Both the <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> handguard are also of a new type and are shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent [...] "bullet rise" [...] within approximately -5 to +42 cm relative {{to the line of}} sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.|$|R
40|$|In industry, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for using fast (i. e. real time) realistic simulation of slender flexible structures in software tools for CAD, digital mock-up and virtual assembly, which nowadays can only handle rigid geometries. Typical examples of such structures from automotive industry are cables, <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>hoses.</b> For slender one-dimensional deformable objects, the theory of Cosserat rods provides a suitable framework for physically correct simulation of deformations like stretching bending and twisting. The static equilibrium equations of such Cosserat models are given {{as a set of}} nonlinear differential equations, which are usually discretized with the Finite Element Method in computational mechanics. This discretization technique provides very accurate simulation results, but is, used in the standard way, computationally far too demanding for fast simulations with an interactive modification of the boundary conditions. The kinematics of Cosserat rods are closely related to the differential geometry of framed curves, whereby the strain measures of the rods corresponds to the differential invariants of the curves, like arc length or curvature. Therefore, ideas from the discrete differential geometry of framed curves are utilized to construct discrete Cosserat rods. This approach leads to qualitatively correct results, even for very coarse discretizations. Hence, {{only a small number of}} degrees of freedom are needed to generate moderately accurate results. This leads to fast computational performance, which makes the discrete Cosserat rod model suitable for interactive simulations. In our contribution, we present such a geometry based discretization approach for flexible one-dimensional structures, together with some application examples of assembly simulation of cables <b>and</b> <b>hoses</b> in automotive industry...|$|R

50|$|The Type 86S design {{departs from}} the usual AK-47 in several ways. The trigger-sear-hammer group is housed in a rear {{extension}} of the receiver, well behind the pistol grip. The operating mechanism {{is exactly the same}} as in the standard AK-47/AKM, {{with the exception of a}} connecting rod between the trigger and sear. The selector switch/safety is quite different from the sheet metal lever found on the standard AK-47/AKM. The Type 86S selector/safety is thumb-shaped and located on the right side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip. The cocking handle is located under the carrying handle. A vertical, spring-loaded, plastic folding fore grip is mounted on the front of the receiver. When not in use, it folds forward beneath the barrel. The magazine well is located to the rear of the pistol grip and will accept 10-, 20-, and 30-round magazines as well as drum magazines. The rear sight is an aperture/peep sight mounted on a cam. Turning the adjustment knob sets the rear sight for 100-, 200-, or 300-meter ranges. Both the front and rear sight are mounted on the combination <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> hand guard which clamps tightly onto the receiver.|$|R
