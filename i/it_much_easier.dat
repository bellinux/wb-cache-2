5|$|In mid-1945, Smyth {{approached}} Datus C. Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Fliegerkorps II sent 650 sorties against Pedestal from 11–14 August {{and claimed}} 12 {{aircraft}} shot down for 18 losses. Total Axis losses were 62 aircraft, 42 Italian and 19 German, including losses {{on the ground}} and those shot down by their own side. Royal Navy gunners and Fleet Air Arm fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down but actually destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the Regia Aeronautica and 16 Luftwaffe aircraft. The Fleet Air Arm lost thirteen aircraft on operations and sixteen Sea Hurricanes when Eagle was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires and a Sunderland was shot down by Giada. The Allies could not risk such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was not attempted until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to provide land-based air cover.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} {{involves}} 12 clubs {{in a series}} of two-legged knockout ties. The six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage, in which they are divided into eight groups of four. The teams in each group play in a double round-robin format, with each team playing home and away games against every other team in their group. The top two teams from each group are then drawn into the knockout stage, which consists of two-legged knockout ties. From that point, the competition proceeds with two-legged knockout ties to quarterfinals, semifinals, and the finals. Between 1960 and 1987 the previous winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage, making <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to retain the cup.|$|E
5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down into the hole they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for echidnas to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas.|$|E

25|$|Transparent OLEDs: Transparent OLEDs use {{transparent}} or semi-transparent contacts on {{both sides}} of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting (transparent).

25|$|Discrepancy in vowel {{category}} {{significantly reduced}} {{the magnitude of}} the McGurk effect for fusion responses. Auditory /a/ tokens dubbed onto visual /i/ articulations were more compatible than the reverse. This could be because /a/ has a wide range of articulatory configurations whereas /i/ is more limited, which makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for subjects to detect discrepancies in the stimuli. /i/ vowel contexts produce the strongest effect, while /a/ produces a moderate effect, and /u/ has almost no effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} this campaign was that the state was vulnerable due to foreign religious efforts (e.g. the Vatican, US evangelical churches) and that therefore the churches in Russia needed to be deprived of all public rights {{with the exception of}} liturgical services conducted within church walls. All of these regulations together made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for the state to arbitrarily persecute clergy and their families, especially with regard to the discriminatory financial, land use and housing regulations.|$|E

25|$|Most Indiana {{counties}} use a grid-based {{system to}} identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> {{to identify the}} sources of calls placed to the 9-1-1 system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state {{are less likely to}} have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to score music for the whistle using {{standard}} musical notation. The tin whistle is not a transposing instrument - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, {{there is no real}} consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave lower than it sounds, to spare ledger lines and make <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to read.|$|E
25|$|In CANDU {{the fuel}} bundles are instead {{contained}} in much smaller metal tubes about 10cm diameter. The tubes are then {{contained in a}} larger vessel containing additional heavy water acting purely as a moderator. This vessel, known as a calandria, is not pressurized and remains at much lower temperatures, making <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to fabricate. In order to prevent {{the heat from the}} pressure tubes leaking into the surrounding moderator, each fuel tube is enclosed in a second tube. Carbon dioxide gas in the gap between the two tubes acts as an insulator. The moderator tank also acts as a large heat sink that provides an additional safety feature.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the outward journey towards the termites, all ants are laying a pheromone trail, making <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for them to find their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission antenna system. One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E
