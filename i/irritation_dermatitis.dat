40|$|Suffering from {{dry skin}} on the hands is a common feature in the general population. This {{condition}} is influenced by daily habits and occupational duties. It commonly corresponds to the expression of <b>irritation</b> <b>dermatitis</b> modulated by climatic and other environmental conditions. Other diseases including allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis and dermatomycosis can also be responsible for a similar clinical presentation. In the common discrete irritative type, a specifically designed cosmetic product may considerably improve the discomfort experienced by the patient. By contrast, the efficacy of most barrier creams remains unconfirmed. The chronic use of topical corticosteroids can lead to dependency and to progressive cutaneous atrophy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A pruritic vesicular, {{pustular}} or squamous eruption {{confined to}} the lateral aspect of fingers or toes corresponds to the overall pattern of dysidrosis. Such a clinical pattern is defined by its peculiar topography. It is encountered in diseases resulting from various etiologies. Thus, conceptually, dysidrosis is a common clinical aspect shared by diverse disorders related to different etiologies and pathomechanisms. The dermatopathological assessment and the patch test procedure {{shed some light on}} this nosological diversity. Allergic contact dermatitis, <b>irritation</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> mycids, alterations of acrosyringia, and drug or food reactions are eventually involved in this process. However, most cases of dysidrotic dermatoses do not disclose their origins and they remain idiopathic. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Demodex {{has been}} {{considered}} to be related with multiple skin disorders, but controversy persists. In this case-control study, a survey was conducted with 860 dermatosis patients aged 12 to 84 years in Xi’an, China to identify the association between facial dermatosis and Demodex. Amongst the patients, 539 suffered from facial dermatosis and 321 suffered from non-facial dermatosis. Demodex mites were sampled and examined using the skin pressurization method. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to analyze the association between facial dermatosis and Demodex infestation, and to identify the risk factors of Demodex infestation. The results showed that total detection rate of Demodex was 43. 0 %. Patients aged above 30 years had higher odds of Demodex infestation than those under 30 years. Compared to patients with neutral skin, patients with mixed, oily, or dry skin {{were more likely to}} be infested with Demodex (odds ratios (ORs) were 2. 5, 2. 4, and 1. 6, respectively). Moreover, Demodex infestation was found to be statistically associated with rosacea (OR= 8. 1), steroid-induced dermatitis (OR= 2. 7), seborrheic dermatitis (OR= 2. 2), and primary <b>irritation</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (OR= 2. 1). In particular, ORs calculated from the severe infestation (≥ 5 mites/cm 2) rate were significantly higher than those of the total rate. Therefore, we concluded that Demodex is associated with rosacea, steroid-induced dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and primary <b>irritation</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The rate of severe infestation is found to be more correlated with various dermatosis than the total infestation rate. The risk factors of Demodex infestation, age, and skin types were identified. Our study also suggested that good hygiene practice might reduce the chances of demodicosis and Demodex infestation...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{considers}} {{an investigation}} of protective formulations (ointment, cream) containing enzyme inhibitors. Model experiments have been made on the enzyme trypsin. It is well accepted that feces and urine are an important causing factor for skin <b>irritation</b> (<b>dermatitis)</b> while using diaper. A protective formulation is a physical barrier that separates the harmful substances from the skin. It can also be an active barrier containing active substances, which can be active both towards the skin, and the substances from feces and urine. By preventing contact from these substances the skin will not be harmed, {{at least for a}} period of time. A number of different inhibitors were tested towards trypsin and they all showed good inhibition, two of the inhibitors were selected to be immobilized with the help of NHS-­activated Sepharose. Immobilization of these two inhibitors leads to a lesser extent of the risk of developing allergy and also that the possible toxic effect can be minimized. ...|$|E

30|$|By definition, true {{tyrosinase}} inhibitors {{are different}} from melanin inhibitors, which interfere with melanin formation by blocking its upstream signal transduction or downstream transportation, regardless of direct enzyme interaction. Blocking upstream signal transduction of tyrosinase includes down-regulation of MC 1 R activity and MITF expression. Blocking downstream transportation includes involvement in melanosomal transfer or epidermal abrasion leading to melanin loss. Tyrosinase inhibitors can chelate copper to prevent substrate binding (Bae-Harboe and Park 2012). Well-known whitening agents, kojic acid and hydroquinone, may induce adverse reactions such as skin <b>irritation,</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> depigmentation, and even cancer. Kojic acid may cause liver toxicity by increased glutathione S-transferase levels, and promote hepatocarcinogenesis (Chusiri et al. 2011; Ota et al. 2009). Hydroquinone may disturb immune response by affecting the function of endotoxin-activated neutrophils or microvascular endothelial cells (Hebeda et al. 2012; Hebeda et al. 2011). Herbs used for cosmetic whitening are widely used among Asians who practice traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). These agents are often composed of {{hundreds or thousands of}} compounds. It is difficult to distinguish which types of compounds that whiten skin effectively are safe for routine use (Ernst 2002; Chan 2011).|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Accumulation {{of toxic}} oxyanion of {{potassium}} tellurite, which {{has increased in}} the environment due to industrial activities, can cause complications in human, such as skin <b>irritation,</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> anorexia, tremor, nausea, vomiting, nervous system stimulation, convulsion, and respiratory arrest. The purpose {{of this research was}} to isolate tellurite-resistant bacteria, determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and evaluate bioreduction of tellurite in strains. Methods: MIC was measured by agar dilution method in 84 resistant strains isolated from wastewater. QWTm 6 strain with tolerance of tellurite concentration of 6684 μg/ml was selected as superior strain. Toleration of this level of tellurite has not been reported yet. Results: According to biochemical, phenotypic, and physiological characteristics, QWTm 6 was initially classified into Staphylococcus genus. Using the spectrophotometric technique and DDTC reagent (A 340 nm & sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate), maximum elimination was seen in 0. 4 mM concentration of potassium tellurite in 24 hours. The strain showed high ability in the elimination of toxic oxyanion of potassium tellurite under a wide range of factors such as pH=(5 - 11), temperature (15 - 50 ◦C), blender speed (50, 100, 150, and 200 rpm), various oxyanion concentrations (0. 04 - 1 mM), and different percentages of NaCl (0 - 20 %). This strain was also resistant to penicillin, cefixime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, neomycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that QWTm 6 could be introduced in the international societies as an acceptable candidate for bioremediation, because of its high ability in removal and reduction of potassium tellurite...|$|E

25|$|More {{aggressive}} self-defense {{measures are}} taken by some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like setae with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging {{in the skin}} or mucous membranes. However some birds (such as cuckoos) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators. The most aggressive caterpillar defenses are bristles associated with venom glands. These bristles are called urticating hairs. A venom which {{is among the most}} potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American silk moth genus Lonomia. Its venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death (See Lonomiasis). This chemical is being investigated for potential medical applications.
