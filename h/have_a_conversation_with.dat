5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E
5|$|Other policemen {{arrived in}} Houndsditch, {{and began to}} attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was {{operated}} on, but he died at 5:30 am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered {{enough to be able to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned for Ben to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E

25|$|In 1947 Childs, who, having {{attended}} the Lenin School was a fluent speaker of Russian, traveled to Moscow on an unspecified mission for the Communist Party, stopping off in France during {{the return trip}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Jacques Duclos, the French Communist Party leader whose 1945 published criticism of the policies of American leader Earl Browder had ultimately lead to his ouster. Childs, a supporter of a majority faction headed by Eugene Dennis was a target of a hardline minority group which included William Z. Foster, Robert Thompson, and Benjamin Davis, used the Daily Worker editor's absence to engineer an ouster, which the Dennis group assented to {{in an attempt to}} calm troubled waters with the minority.|$|E
500|$|The film {{begins on}} [...] "Friday, April 17" [...] at 4 pm in Venice, California. Huckleberry P. Jones, local pimp, {{narcotics}} peddler and slumlord, enters a vacant house that he owns. While stashing heroin in the basement, he stumbles upon a mysterious door and enters it, {{falling into the}} Sixth Dimension, from which he promptly escapes. After retrieving the heroin, he sells {{the house to the}} Hercules family. On their way to school, Frenchy Hercules and her brother Flash <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Squeezit Henderson, who tells them that, while being violently beaten by his mother, he had a vision of his transgender sister Ren√©, who had fallen into the Sixth Dimension through the door in the Hercules' basement.|$|E
500|$|In {{a comment}} {{published}} on 1 December 2013 in The Independent {{in response to}} supporters' chants and banners of [...] "City Till (sic) We Die", Allam said, [...] "They can die {{as soon as they}} want, as long as they leave the club for the majority who just want to watch good football." [...] The supporters responded with chants of [...] "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" [...] during that day's home match against Liverpool. Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I have got to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." [...] However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, [...] "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward then we have to respect it." ...|$|E

500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And then we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's {{one of the things}} [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E
500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think for a minute that Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E
500|$|Spin-off {{media has}} tried {{to fill in the}} gaps of Ianto's {{character}} history from before he began working at Torchwood Three; Ianto's first week at Torchwood One is shown in a flashback in the novel Trace Memory. The segment also depicts his budding relationship with Lisa Hallett. Also expanding on Jones's time living in London, the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One! (Torchwood #1) shows how Ianto was taken under the wing of Rupert Howarth, a senior researcher, during his first few weeks at Torchwood One. Ianto's characterisation is explored in The Twilight Streets, in which Ianto sheds some light on the difficulty he had [...] "coming out" [...] as a teenager; Ianto's mother tried to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> him about it, but he remarks [...] "She didn't work me out, Gwen. No one has. And if I ever do, I'll let you know." [...] He then engages in a diatribe with Gwen {{about what it means to}} him to be bisexual after Gwen jokes to him that he has the [...] "best of both worlds". A scene in David-Lloyd's [...] "Shrouded", in which Ianto is emailing his sister, Owen is seen to wrestle control of the computer and tries to write to her that [...] "I've recently discovered that I'm a Big Old Gay"; Ianto rebukes him. In the storyline's conclusion, an alternate timeline is created where Ianto did not die in the events of Children of Earth.|$|E
500|$|... "Last Day in Florida" [...] {{was written}} by Robert Padnick, his second writing credit for the season after [...] "Gettysburg". The episode was {{directed}} by Matt Sohn, his third director's credit for the season after [...] "Pam's Replacement" [...] and [...] "Tallahassee". The episode marks the fifth appearance of Catherine Tate as Nellie Bertram and her fourth consecutive appearance. Her character, Nellie, worked with several of the office workers on a special project for Sabre in a six episode arc. The episode also features a guest appearance from David Koechner, who appears as Todd Packer in the series. He recently {{made a deal with}} NBC to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer Greg Daniels's next series, Friday Night Dinner, an adaption of the British series of the same name. Lindsey Broad, who portrays Cathy Simms, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave, makes her twelfth and final appearance on the series. The episode also marks the second appearance of Georgia Engel as Irene, Erin's elderly new friend. Showrunner Paul Lieberstein {{said in an interview that}} he was excited for her appearance calling her performance [...] "fantastic". She will appeared three episodes in the season. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Irene introducing Erin to her grandson who asks Erin to go on a date with him, which she says yes to, and Packer attempting to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> California over the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones, but learns Robert has not seen the series.|$|E

2500|$|Cusack and {{the writers}} floated {{the idea that}} Rob could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Bruce Springsteen in his head, {{inspired}} by a reference in Hornby's book where the narrator wishes he could handle his past girlfriends as well as Springsteen does in his song, [...] "Bobby Jean" [...] on Born in the U.S.A. They never believed they would actually get the musician {{to appear in the}} film, but thought putting him in the script would get the studio excited about it. Cusack knew Springsteen socially and called the musician up and pitched the idea. Springsteen asked for a copy of the script and afterwards agreed to do it.|$|E
