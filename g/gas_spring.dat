5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, gas ram, gas strut or nitro piston) instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. <b>Gas</b> <b>spring</b> units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. <b>Gas</b> <b>spring</b> air guns are also usually less [...] "hold-sensitive" [...] and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.|$|E

40|$|Although rotary {{steerable}} {{systems have been}} evolving rapidly and delivering unprecedented rates of drilling penetration, drillers nevertheless seek technologies that further accelerate the drilling process. Currently, most down-hole motors with rotating drill bits are driven by positive displacement motors and down-hole turbine motors. These motors are classified {{depending on the type}} of power sections that are used to convert the hydraulic energy of high pressure fluids to mechanical energy in the form of torque output. In these designs, the power is transmitted from the power section to the drill bit through different mechanical arrangements, such as drive shafts, coupling assemblies, bearings, etc. During the transmission process, part of the developed torque is wasted, which reduces the efficiency. In addition, bearing stresses limit the transfer of possible forces to the drill bit. We proposed a novel concept to overcome these difficulties. The proposed concept is unique because of the combination of a linear electrical machine and <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> These <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> allow the piston of the linear electrical machine to oscillate at different frequencies depending on the required load conditions. The characteristics of the high energy <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> provide the opportunity to oscillate heavier piston with longer stroke lengths. A large electromagnetic force from permanent magnets and coils, in combination with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> creates a high power linear electric actuator. The oscillating heavy piston causes a considerable vibration in the housing, which is utilized in the drilling application. The load can then be attached directly to the housing and the machine can be made hermitically sealed, which eliminates leakage problems. These features make the actuator suitable as a hammer in oil drilling applications. A linear permanent magnet actuator (oscillomotor) is an energy conversion device that integrates a linear permanent magnet (PM) machine and <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> into a single unit. My research work mainly addresses the design criteria, analytical and finite element method (FEM) design calculations and dynamic analysis of the linear permanent magnet actuator with <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> The selection of a suitable linear PM machine configuration is very important to achieve the required demands, such as a compact diameter size, easy integration of <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> reduced losses to reduce heat generation, robustness, less maintenance and higher force from the starting position. Different linear PM machine configurations, such as flat, double flat, tubular longitudinal and transverse flux, are discussed for drilling applications. The tubular longitudinal flux configuration is selected as the most promising for drilling applications. This study analyses the selection of different mover configurations and different magnet patterns. Design parameters such as pole pitch, magnet width, stator inner diameter and air gap size are optimized based on the analytical analysis of force characteristics. The complete design process of the linear machine is discussed. Dynamic models of the linear actuator are developed. Three prototypes of the linear actuator are built to verify the novel concept and validate the force characteristics and dynamic modelling. The Force characteristics of the prototype I is verified with the FEM simulated results. Impact tests are carried out using prototype III. The test results shows the power input required at resonance is very low compared to the other frequencies. The impact force per amp at resonance is 9. 26 kN. The possibility of producing these higher power impacts at resonance, suitable for hard rock drilling. Drill test is carried out using prototype II. The Effect of feed force on the dynamic behaviour is discussed. The rate of penetration with different resonant frequencies and different weight on bits are discussed. This study also focuses on the suitability of this novel concept in other offshore applications, such as wireline jar applications and ocean wave power generation. Henceforth, this thesis describes the concept of the conversion of the movement of a float in a wave power plant, which is characterized by high force and low speed energy, to a high speed and low force energy in a linear generator by using <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> The simulation model shows that an oscillating piston that is supported by <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> and is compressed and decompressed by a wave can convert more kinetic energy per volume from the float to a secondary piston compared to a secondary piston that is simply attached to the float. This model has not yet been validated with experimental work. According to the simulation results, the size of the generator can be reduced by a factor of 12 for the same power output compared to a buoy-connected piston...|$|R

This combination of an electric linear machine and <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> shows promising theoretical results for the intended application: A novel method of creating strong vibrations with high frequency. The intention of building prototype 2 B is {{to contribute to the}} development of a hammer drill system, suitable for drilling in hard rock formations. This thesis describes the main characteristics of the machine design, and discusses alternatives to the chosen topology. Performance parameters of 2 B are analytically derived, and found suitable for exploring the effects of increasing hammer frequency in hard rock hammer drilling. An important contribution of this thesis is a new theory, applicable for simple and effective analyses of the mechanical motion of two moving objects in 2 B; piston and stator. The theory is defined for an ideal no-load situation with no external influence. A moving mass equivalent, defined as a function of piston- and stator mass, is suggested and theoretically substantiated. Comparison to results from numerical simulations validates this model for the no-load ideal case. This theory is applicable for directly relating acceleration, velocity and displacement of piston and stator, to the masses of the two objects. The moving mass equivalent is useful for easily calculating important performance properties, such as hammer amplitude, system energy and resonance frequency...|$|R

40|$|An {{adjustable}} art {{table was}} designed for the artists at Passion Works Studio to fulfill {{a need for a}} wheelchair-friendly art table. The client desired that the table be sturdy, not electronic and can be used by multiple users. In response, a mechanical approach was taken and various raising devices were explored. A mechanical height adjustment would make for a more stable table and would not require any electricity or motor to adjust. The table also was built with a large, smooth tabletop designed specifically for multiple users making art. The highlight feature is the height adjustment which allows the table to adjust between 29 and 42. 5 inches. The table requires just one person to raise, and two people to lower. To raise the table, an individual only needs to unlock the legs and then press in a button to activate the <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> which raise the table. Once the table is set to the desired height, the table can lock into place securely.
