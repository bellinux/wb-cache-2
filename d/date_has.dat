5|$|Opening of {{the first}} Federal Parliament, 9 May – The date 9 May is also {{sometimes}} suggested, the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in Melbourne in 1901, {{the date of the}} opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, and the date of the opening of the New Parliament House in 1988. The <b>date</b> <b>has,</b> at various times, found support from former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Tony Beddison, and Geoffrey Blainey. However, the <b>date</b> <b>has</b> been seen by some as being too closely connected with Victoria, and its location close to the start of winter has been described as an impediment.|$|E

On 11June2002, McCartney married Mills in an elaborate ceremony at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, County Monaghan, Ireland, where more than 300 guests were invited and the reception included a vegetarian banquet.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it is unclear how comparable the two studies are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, You described Magnirostris in 2003, but to <b>date</b> <b>has</b> not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E

The <b>date</b> <b>has</b> also changed from 30 April to 27 April, which is the {{birthday}} of Willem-Alexander. On the first King's Day – held on 26 April 2014 because 27 April 2014 was a Sunday – the king visited De Rijp and Amstelveen (originally planned to be visited by Queen Beatrix in 2013, but postponed due to her abdication).|$|E

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this <b>date</b> <b>has</b> at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor.

5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative <b>date</b> <b>has</b> been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process.

Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E

DuMont's last broadcast, a boxing match, aired on August 6, 1956. The <b>date</b> <b>has</b> also been reported as April 1950, September 1955, or August 4, 1958.
