40|$|Heat-insulating {{cellular}} concrete {{manufactured in the}} variotropic pressure environment, may be used both for making single-piece products, and for monolithic construction purposes. Optimization of technology-related parameters prevents excessive consumption of principal components, while output products maintain pre-set characteristics. Both the product and the technology {{are based on the}} provisions of the general methodology of development of highly porous materials. The technology is based on the principle of adjustable formation of the state of stress in the variotropic pressure environment. The state of stress maintained in the course of blowout contributes to formation of optimized cellular structure (in accordance with the criteria that include the shape, dimensions of pores, and characteristics of interpore partitions). The process of manufacturing of the heat-insulating {{cellular concrete}} breaks down into the following stages: preparation of raw materials, preparation of the cellular concrete mixture, casting of products, thermal processing or ageing in the natural environment. Products are placed under heating domes, equipped with electric heaters, and exposed to heat treatment for six hours. Before the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>products</b> are kept in their moulds for four hours. In the absence of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>products</b> are kept on their pallets for 14 days. Selection of the appropriate composition and optimal technological parameters is performed with the help of G-BAT- 2011 software programme developed at MSUCE. The software is based on the methodology that is based on complete factorial experiments, experiments based on fractional replicates and testing of all essential statistical hypotheses. Linear, incomplete quadratic and quadratic equations generated as a result of experiments make it possible to design a model that represents natural processes in the adequate manner.

On the one hand, service durability (as a property) is generated in the course of material production, and on the other hand, it depends on the conditions that the material is exposed to in the course of any construction process. The same parameter affects energy-related criteria. Insulation replacement or unplanned repairs add supplementary energy costs.

40|$|Some {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) can overexpress heat shock proteins and thus survive the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of meat <b>products.</b> The objective of this work was the effect of probiotic thermotolerant {{lactic acid bacteria}} on the physicochemical, microbiological and sensorial characteristics in a meat batter. Two thermotolerant probiotic lactic bacteria were used: Pediococcus pentosaceus and Enterococcus faecium, which were inoculated to 5 % in a meat batter, another batter was made with the mixture of both strains; a batter without bacteria was the control. Both physicochemical and microbiological analyses were performed at day 1, 6, 13 and 16. At day 1 a discriminatory sensory evaluation was performed. The {{results show that the}} stability to cooking, expressible moisture, hardness and cohesion increased during storage in the batters inoculated with the 2 strains of LAB. The LAB increased in the inoculated meat batters and the coliforms decreased overall, when the strain mixture was used, the inhibition was total at day 6. Sensory analysis showed that judges detect when E. faecium are inoculated. Thermotolerant BALs can be used as functional ingredients in meat batters and improve physical-chemical and microbiological characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} first <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> {{temperature}}, second <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature and second <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> time on titanium films {{by measuring the}} sheet resistance was investigated using statistical design of experiment. Two-level screening experiment with 23 factorial design {{was used to evaluate}} three effects in eight combination runs. The analysis of variance revealed that, the second <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature was significant and being the main contributing factors to the final sheet resistance of the titanium silicide.
