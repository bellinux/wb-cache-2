5|$|In <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> the russet sparrow {{is found}} in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, {{a small part of}} {{mainland}} Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident. The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern Thailand. In <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> the autumn migration occurs between August and November.|$|E
5|$|R. r. japonensis (Blakiston, 1862). Breeds in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> {{including}} Japan, Korea, China and Siberia; it is greener and has darker upper-parts {{than the}} nominate form, and has broad white wingbars.|$|E
5|$|Sivaladapids of {{southern}} and <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia</b> are best {{known from the}} Miocene, and the only adapiforms to survive past the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~34mya).

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia</b> and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} native to North America and <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> they have adapted well to {{countries}} {{in which they have}} been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand. Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced.|$|E
5|$|Antlers {{are also}} used in artwork, {{furniture}} and other novelty items.

Elk farms are relatively common in North America and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Boletus auripes, {{commonly}} known as the butter-foot bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> Central America, and eastern North America from Canada to Florida. It is a mycorrhizal species and typically grows in association with oak and beech trees.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes kill {{an average}} of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, {{the most in the}} world. Reasons for this include the region's high {{population}} density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia.</b>|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia</b> and eastern North America. In North America, where it is {{relatively}} common, the range of the fungus extends from Alaska south to Mexico, and east to New York. In Central America, it has been recorded in Belize. The mushroom has also been recorded from Taiwan, China (including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Kwangsi, and Hunan), and Japan. It was reported for the first time from the Russian Far East in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Callaghan {{is perhaps}} best known for ordering, despite {{disagreement}} from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a suicide attack on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of vice admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian maritime transport before retiring to Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, other {{similarly}} green-capped species {{collected by}} mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills {{of the genus}} Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing {{to a series of}} restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia</b> and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north {{at least as far as}} central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia</b> to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several Omphalotus {{species with}} similar bioluminescent {{properties}} occur worldwide, {{all of which}} are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O.japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia.</b> A 2004 molecular study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olivascens), which is abundant in Southern and Central California. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.|$|E
5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> but the crop did not move beyond this region until well into the 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with several pine species, particularly eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is found in <b>eastern</b> <b>Asia,</b> northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout {{the range of the}} host tree. The mushroom is edible, although opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species, including the closely related S.decipiens, although the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.|$|E
