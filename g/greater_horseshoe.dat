5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Ten of the {{seventeen}} {{species of}} UK bat are {{found on the}} property, eight within {{the structure of the}} house alone. Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat. Maintenance work is timed to fit in with hibernating and mating schedules, and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors may see some of the property's bats on a closed-circuit television system.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is used by}} both <b>Greater</b> and Lesser <b>Horseshoe</b> Bats. The roofspace of one of {{the former}} works {{building}} was used, before the building burnt down in the 1980s, as a breeding roost in summer by large numbers of <b>Greater</b> <b>Horseshoes</b> and smaller numbers of Lesser Horseshoes. Disused flues and tunnels in a low cliff are used for hibernation.|$|R

5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter hairstreak (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. <b>Greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{closed at}} the end of the 2008 season when the owner retired. Subsequently, the nonprofit {{organisation}} Conservatoire d'espaces naturels du Nord et Pas-de-Calais (Conservatory of natural sites of the Nord and Pas-de-Calais) purchased it at a cost of â‚¬330,000, with funding provided by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional council, the European Union and a private benefactor. The Conservatory's interest was due to the presence on the site of a large bat colony that included rare species, such as the <b>Greater</b> <b>Horseshoe</b> Bat, Geoffroy's Bat and the Pond Bat.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E

25|$|The Box Mine {{consists}} {{of a network of}} tunnels, which originate from stone mining work. Stone extraction started during the Roman occupation of Britain and ceased in 1968. The mine is now popular for recreational underground trips, and is home to a large population of bats. Up to 10% of the total British population of <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat uses the mine at times, and a maximum of 230 individuals of the species have been counted at the site. The Lesser Horseshoe Bat also uses the mine, as do the four Myotis species: Whiskered, Brandt's, Natterer's and Daubenton's bats.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 235 {{vertebrate}} {{species were}} identified {{within the boundaries}} of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinoloplus euryale). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (Sorex granarius), the European pine marten (Martes martes), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) and the snub-nosed viper (Vipera latastei). A few of the local species are protected by the Bern Convention. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985-1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of the town are several caves of the Mendip Hills, {{including}} Thrupe Lane Swallet which is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and the St. Dunstan's Well Catchment which is an important cave system including a series of spectacularly-decorated caves which in total extend to about [...] of mapped passage. The caves at Fairy Cave Quarry were formed mainly by the erosive action of water flowing beneath the water-table at considerable pressure (so called 'phreatic' development), but as the water table has fallen many of the caves now lie well above it and the system now contains a variety of cave formations (stalagmites, stalactites and calcite curtains) which in their extent and preservation are amongst the best in Britain. Shatter Cave and Withyhill Cave are generally considered to be amongst the finest decorated caves in Britain in terms of their sheer abundance of pure white and translucent calcite deposits. Small numbers of <b>greater</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (R. hipposideros) and Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) hibernate in the cave system. An area of nationally rare species-rich unimproved calcareous grassland of the Sheep's-fescue-Meadow Oat-grass type occurs in the field to the east of Stoke Lane Quarry.|$|E

5000|$|The Golden Horseshoe {{has been}} {{recognised}} as a geographic region since the 1950s, {{but it was}} only on July 13, 2004 that a report from the provincial Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal entitled Places to Grow coined the term <b>Greater</b> Golden <b>Horseshoe,</b> extending the boundaries west to Waterloo Region, north to Barrie/Simcoe County, and northeast to the county and city of Peterborough. [...] A subsequent edition released February 16, 2005, broadened the term further, adding Brant, Haldimand and Northumberland Counties to the now quasi-administrative region. The <b>Greater</b> Golden <b>Horseshoe</b> region is officially designated in Ontario Regulation 416/05 under the Places to Grow Act. The designation <b>Greater</b> Golden <b>Horseshoe</b> has legal significance with respect to taxation: In April 2017, the Government of Ontario announced plans to impose a 15 per cent Non-Resident Speculation Tax (NRST) on non-Canadian citizens, non-permanent residents and non-Canadian corporations (with exceptions or rebates for refugees, qualifying students and certain people working in Ontario) buying residential properties containing one to six units in the <b>Greater</b> Golden <b>Horseshoe</b> (GGH).|$|R
