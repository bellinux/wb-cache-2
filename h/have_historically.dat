5|$|Cartography, {{the study}} and {{practice}} of map-making, and geography, {{the study of the}} lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government.|$|E

5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food.

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{subspecies}} are often poorly differentiated, {{and may be}} at a flexible stage of subspecies formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour tone of the local habitat, {{and the size of}} available prey.

5|$|These routes – {{spreading}} religion, {{trade and}} technology – <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> been {{vital to the}} growth of urban civilization.

5|$|Although the {{cardinals}} <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> gathered at {{a handful of}} other locations within Rome and beyond, only five elections since 1455 have been held outside the Apostolic Palace. Twenty-eight papal elections have been held outside Rome, in: Terracina (1088), Cluny (1119), Velletri (1181), Verona (1185), Ferrara (October 1187), Pisa (December 1187), Perugia (1216, 12641265, 1285, 12921294, 13041305), Anagni (1243), Naples (1254, 1294), Viterbo (1261, 12681271, July 1276, August–September 1276, 1277, 12811282), Arezzo (January 1276), Carpentras/Lyon (13141316), Avignon (1334, 1342, 1352, 1362, 1370), Konstanz (1417) and Venice (17991800). Three elections moved between locations while in progress: the elections of 1268–71, 1292–94, and 1314–16.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} <b>have</b> <b>historically</b> blocked {{residents of}} Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
