2500|$|The terms verlig ("enlightened") and verkramp ("cramped") {{entered the}} Afrikaans (and later English) vernacular {{during the late}} 1960s. They were first used in a speech by prof. [...] (son of Jan de Klerk and brother of future State President of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk) on 6 October 1966, exactly {{a month after the}} {{assassination}} of dr. Hendrik Verwoerd. In his speech, De Klerk distinguished between verligte, verkrampte, and positiewe ("positive") Afrikaners. This threefold division would soon be simplified in the colloquial language to a simpler dichotomous partition between simply verlig and verkramp. What De Klerk called [...] "positive Afrikaners" [...] would then refer to what generally became known as verligte Afrikaners. He described positive Afrikaners (verligtes, thus) as [...] "purpose conscious Afrikaners". [...] "And purpose means to recognize the enduring and the changing. The closedness and the openness. The tradition and the progression... The purpose conscious Afrikaner recognizes and appreciates the tradition, and yet he is the man of today and with a vision on tomorrow, until eternity. The Afrikaner heritage is the Afrikaner-Christendom with the Calvinistic bedrock which recognizes the authority of the Bible as revelation and guide. But also he is open to further study of Scripture and he seeks the new roads to expand his religious heritage. At the same time the Afrikaner culture is young and virile, and is still busy to form itself on many levels, without having to cut ties with the past. The Book teaches clearly that <b>exaggerated</b> <b>nationalism</b> (idolatry of the People) as well as cosmopolitism contrast with the stipulations of God. Just as ungodly is the nationalized religion, which is the same as idolatry of the People." ...|$|E

[...] De Klerk labeled the verkrampte Afrikaner as follows: “His fundamental axiom is: adherence to the extant, to the old ideas and customs and content is the test for being Afrikaner. He wants to lead us to rigidity; wants to exclude us from a new world; is a negativist. Also, he is ruled by the need to criticize. He is creative in his ability to sow distrust; hardened in the handling of one-sided slogans to generate witch hunts everywhere; accomplished in the technique of quibbling. He is without consideration and mercy, unwilling to converse, fanatic and extremist to enforce his opinion on a matter. He wants to forcefully push our youth into one-sidedness; haughty, stubborn self-preservation.” The verlig-verkramp-strife came to the fore after the assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd. Differences that had been existing {{for a number of years}} began to manifest publicly, especially in the early days of new premier John Vorster's term.|$|E
50|$|The key {{features}} of {{the literature of the}} newborn country are <b>exaggerated</b> affect, <b>nationalism,</b> celebration of nature and the initial introduction of colloquial language. Romantic literature soon became very popular. Novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Manuel Antônio de Almeida and José de Alencar published their works in serial form in the newspapers and became national celebrities.|$|R

40|$|Over a {{long period}} the philosopher, Maurice Blondel, was {{an outspoken critic of}} <b>exaggerated</b> <b>nationalism.</b> The series of {{articles}} that appeared in 1909 - 10 in the Annales de philosophie chrétienne under the title of « La Semaine sociale de Bordeaux », and later were published in book form, contained a philosophically and theologically motivated critique of the early support shown by French Catholics for the doctrinaire nationalism of Charles Maurras. In 1928 Blondel returned to a critique of this same nationalism in his detailed article « Patrie et Humanité ». But the further criticism of nationalism contained in parts of his book Lutte pour la civilisation et philosophie de la paix, which was published in 1939 (and anew in 1947 in a slightly revised edition), was of a different order, being focused on the nationalism associated with what Blondel termed totalitarisme in its then German or Nazi form. Despite this record, {{it would be a mistake}} to assume that Blondel was an internationalist fitting clearly into the Briand mould. After the First World War Blondel favoured the hard-line foreign policy advocated by Poincaré and Foch, in particular over the future of the Rhineland. And he remained a conservative Catholic. His book of 1939 denounced not only totalitarisme in both its Nazi and Soviet forms, but also, on an opposing front, liberalism in the social and economic sphere. As to the deleterious effect of nationalism on international relations, he was an advocate of strengthening international law, notably the corpus of law emanating from The Hague. Maurice Blondel was greatly admired by Robert Schuman, the prominent French foreign minister under the Fourth Republic and a key figure for post-war European integration...|$|E
