When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city."

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews for [...] "Night Out" [...] were mixed. Zap2It's Rick Porter {{thought that}} {{although}} it wasn't [...] "as sublime in its Needy Michael-ness as last week's [...] " [...] and [...] "in some ways, though, it was {{maybe even a}} little sadder", [...] "Night Out" [...] was [...] "still pretty darn funny". Porter went on to praise the acting work of both B. J. Novak and Paul Lieberstein, {{as well as the}} writing of Mindy Kaling. TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, so true, Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> episode of The Office when I had two pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed {{to the success of the}} episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling. She also praised the storyline of the episode that did not involve Michael and Dwight, saying [...] "The second plotline was its usual funny filler.

Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t {{know what kind of}} mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ailing tourism {{sector of}} France, already {{reeling from the}} January and November 2015 attacks in Paris, {{suffered}} a further hit following the Nice attack. After the attack, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) urged British tourists to follow the instructions of French authorities, who cancelled events and closed the promenade {{and a number of}} public beaches in Nice. Cancellations and last-minute changes to European holidays rose in the summer, with travellers increasingly concerned about the threat of terrorism. Other terrorist attacks in Belgium and Turkey prompted holidaymakers to cancel their bookings or seek out other destinations perceived to be safe. The Nice attack, along with the recent failed coup in Turkey, were expected to add to the pressure.

2500|$|In 1951, E. W. Kettering wrote a {{paper for}} the ASME entitled, History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine, which goes into great {{detail about the}} {{technical}} obstacles that were encountered during {{the development of the}} 567 engine (these same considerations apply to the 645 and 710). The 567's designers started with a tabula rasa,"In time most of the early bugs were cleaned up, but it was becoming more evident that to make a substantial gain in the durability of the 201A engine a major redesign would be in order. The diesel locomotive was rapidly proving itself and to the more optimistic it looked like it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business, so it was decided that the engine would be redesigned for railroad use only. The design would not be handicapped by requirements for marine, Navy, or stationary application. Most of the Winton experimental design group moved to Detroit where the redesign was to be made. After settling in Detroit we took a large piece of paper and on one side wrote down all of the troubles which were known in the 201A engine at that time. On the other side we were going to write down parts of the engine which had been satisfactory. These items were based on the four years experience in the field and the test work at Winton and General Motors Research. It did not take long to fill in one side of the sheet. In fact, the more we looked into what we could salvage of the 201A design to correct all of these troubles the more apparent it was that we should start with a clean piece of paper and forget the 201A." [...] systematically eliminating each of the 201A's many deficiencies which were preventing the earlier design from becoming successful in freight service, although the 201A was relatively successful in the less-demanding passenger and switching services. The 567 design had nothing in common with the 201A except the two-stroke cycle itself: each and every component of the 201A was replaced with a new design, even the [...] "dipstick", to paraphrase one of Kettering's off-handed comments. The 567 proved to be exceptionally successful in passenger, switching, freight, marine and stationary services, and, counting its two successors, the 645 and 710, which are not materially different from the 567 (all have the same external dimensions, differing mainly in per cylinder displacement), collectively have given nearly 80 years of exceptionally reliable service to those applications. As but one example of the achievements of the tabula rasa design: whereas the Winton 201A was doing very well with a [...] piston lifetime, the 567 immediately achieved a [...] piston lifetime, and in at least one case, reached a [...] piston lifetime, a 10:1 to 20:1 improvement."A brief comparison can be drawn as to life of pistons in passenger service. These comparisons must be based on passenger operation as there never were any 201As in any other service than passenger and switcher. The 201A aluminum piston at the very beginning did not run 50,000 miles and the later 201A pistons ran a questionable 100,000 miles in hard service. The average life of the first 567 piston was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000. On one major railroad the average life of the current design two-piece piston is at least one million miles (Fig. 24)." ...|$|E
