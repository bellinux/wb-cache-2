40|$|For the {{large-scale}} integration of electricity from {{renewable energy sources}} (RES-E), the German system seems to reach its limits. In 2009, the electricity wholesale market experienced serious negative prices at times of high wind and low demand. The <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> in Germany consists of a fixed feed-in price, a take-off obligation and a RES priority rule, and in practice only very restrictive use of RES-E curtailment. Exactly the latter is the problem. We argue that the overall performance of the system would improve seriously by lifting the restrictions {{on the use of}} voluntary curtailment agreements, while retaining the priority rule as such. Since generators of RES-E can only improve under this system reform, investment conditions improve, leading to higher installed RES-E capacity. This in turn implies that reduced wind output due to curtailment can actually be offset by higher wind output in all periods {{in which there is no}} problem.

40|$|The {{development}} of renewable power generation in the United States is hampered by policy incoherency between federal, state, {{and local governments}} that results in insufficient overall investment incentives. By contrast, unprecedented levels of renewable energy deployment have been achieved in several European countries using guaranteed national tariffs for feeding electricity into the transmission grid by private operators on a priority basis. Despite far less sunshine, 55 % of the world’s solar capacity is presently installed in Germany with a feed-in policy that promotes technical innovation, climate protection, and job creation. Operator reimbursement is guaranteed for 20 years to insure payback of capital-intensive generation equipment and to stimulate new investment. Renewable energies already provide one seventh of total generated power in Germany, higher than the level predicted by EPRI for the United States by 2030.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how {{changes in the}} support scheme may affect electricity generation from agricultural Combined Heat and Power (CHP) biogas plants in Germany. A recursive Multi-Agent System (MAS) for investment decision-making is coupled with GIS data.

For illustration, we apply the model to the German federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, for which we estimate an additional economic capacity potential of 409 MWel. Overall, we conclude that current feed-in payments per unit of electric power provided are probably not too far off the optimum level, if one considers the maximum diffusion of CHP units possible. However, the current <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> may overtly favor small generating units, thereby failing to incentivize coordination among farmers for joint resource use in larger and more efficient plants.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of electricity generation from renewable sources in Germany is {{promoted by the}} Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG), which was last amended in June 2008. In {{a review of the}} EEG the political parameters, the progress achieved, and the impacts of the Act itself are set out. This Progress Report addresses cross-sectoral aspects, notably CO 2 emissions reduction, job creation, investment and turnover in the renewables industry, and that industry's prospects for the future. Trends in the individual renewables sectors are described and policy recommendations formulated, as appropriate, on this basis. The policy recommendations have been incorporated into the new EEG from 6 June 2008. The overarching goal of the new EEG is to achieve a renewables share of at least 30 % in Germany's electricity consumption in 2020. This underlines the need for radical modernisation of the energy system as a whole. This article presents an overview of the content of the Progress Report and supplements it with current statistical data and research findings contained in other publications from the Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMU).

40|$|The {{electricity}} generation by {{renewable energy sources}} in Germany has been growing considerably throughout the past years. This development {{has led to an}} intensive debate on the cost of the German <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> which has to be paid by the consumers. An important aspect which has {{to be taken into account}} in the current discussion is the impact of privileged renewable {{electricity generation}} on the electricity market in Germany. This paper seeks to analyse the impact of renewable electricity generation on spot market prices. Thereby a main focus is given to the “merit-order effect ” but the impact of renewable electricity generation on the CO 2 market is also discussed. Renewable electricity generation reduces the remaining load that has to be purchased on the electricity markets. A stylized overview of the discussed effects of renewable electricity generation for a single hour is given in Figure 1. As long as the supply curve has a positive slope the reduced demand on the market leads to lower prices (see also Bode, Groscurth, 2006, Neubarth et al., 2006). As this effect shifts market prices along the German merit-order of power plants the effect is called merit-order-effect in this paper. Since renewable electricity generation reduces the demand for CO 2 certificates in the European Emission trading system this can also have an impact on market prices on the CO 2 market (see also Rathmann, 2007) which again shifts the supply curve on the electricity market...|$|E
40|$|The main policy {{instruments}} currently {{used in the}} EU Member States to achieve the targets set for electricity produced from renewable energy sources are: (1) the quota obligation system; (2) the feed-in tariff system; and (3) the tendering system. The current study aims to review the experience gained with the quota obligation system. The report {{provides an overview of}} the regions where obligation systems have been implemented and contains a detailed evaluation of the performance of the obligation systems in the USA, the UK and in Sweden. The obligation systems in these countries have been evaluated based on the following criteria: Effectiveness; Market efficiency; Certainty for the renewable energy industry; Cost effectiveness; Stakeholder support for the obligation system; and Equity. The evaluation of international experiences with the obligation system gives rise to a mixed picture. Although an obligation in theory is effective and cost effective, it seems too early to conclude that the system delivers these promises in practice. On the one hand {{this is due to the}} limited period of implementation that makes it hard to distinguish between the direct effect of the system and some teething problems that will be solved in due time. On the other hand, the conclusion can be drawn that the obligation is a complex system, which will only function well if designed carefully. It does seem worthwhile, however, to continue monitoring the experiences with the obligation system abroad, because this will further reveal whether the system is indeed effective and cost effective in practice. In the longer term, e. g. beyond 2010, the introduction of an obligation system in the Netherlands could be considered. Finally, as the design of support schemes is being improved, it appears that the basic concepts of both the obligation system and the feed in system have been refined in such a way that the two systems are gradually converging. An important difference between the two systems however remains, namely that an obligation system relies more on market forces whereas the <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> is based on a greater involvement of the government...|$|E
40|$|The bio energy {{industry}} provides interesting investment opportunities due to several factors including; a strong {{political will to}} increase renewable energy production, favourable financial returns and opportunity to benefit from available governmental grant schemes and subsidies. Biomass is also {{to a large extent}} an untapped resource that offers opportunities for greater exploitation. However, there are obstacles for an expansion of the bio {{energy industry}} such as logistical and technical issues as well as relatively long investment horizons (as a result of high capital costs). This thesis examines and compares the investment situation facing the Swedish, German and UK bio energy sectors through; literature studies, qualitative interviews and country specific calculations of maximum feedstock (i. e. wood) paying capabilities (WPC’s) for relevant technologies. The three thesis included countries are interesting to compare from an investment perspective as they differ regarding biomass resources, established technologies, implemented governmental incentive schemes for renewable energy sources etc. Thirteen interviews consisting of one phone conference with more than one person interviewed, one personal meeting and eleven phone interviews form the base for the empirical material. The persons interviewed are either generally knowledgeable of the bio energy sector as a whole or associated to a specific bio energy producing installations. The interviews highlight high associated capital costs, economic optimisation of feedstock supply, existing demand, access to electric and/or heat grids and governmental incentive systems as determining factors for investors in the three countries. The thesis included countries have different ways of supporting renewable energy generation. In Sweden and the UK, government imposed quota regulations on suppliers to source parts of their electricity from renewable energy sources are imposed. These quota systems rely on certificates being handed out to producers of green electricity for each MWh of electricity produced. These certificates must then be sourced by suppliers {{in order for them to}} prove that they have fulfilled their renewable energy quota. The certificate price is set by market conditions, i. e. the relation between the number of producer awarded certificates in relation to the set quota for suppliers. In Germany a <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> is applied which rewards producers with a guaranteed grid access and a minimum fixed electricity price for each MWh of green electricity fed in to the grid. The German system is limited to smaller scale installations with a capacity of no more than 20 MWe and an output not exceeding 175, 2 GWh annually. The Swedish and UK quota systems are well liked by some of the as they support any installation scale and as they are market oriented systems which allows renewable energy sources to compete with traditional energy sources such as coal. Respondents however see a problem in making long term investment decisions based on fluctuating certificate prices. The German <b>feed-in</b> <b>system</b> is viewed as a stable and reliable remuneration scheme where investors know exactly what revenues they can expect from their electricity production. However, as the feed-in level is fixed producers cannot pass on increasing costs to the end consumers as is the case with variable electricity prices. The Wood Paying Capability (WPC) calculations point towards a relatively high paying capability (SE= 30, 1 €/MWh, DE= 45, 6 €/MWh, UK= 37, 9 €/MWh) which is generally well above biomass prices. The relatively high WPC values indicate that there are positive profit margins on all three markets. Furthermore, the WPC results display large variations in paying capability between the three countries. These variations in turn may be explained by governmental remuneration levels being adjusted to differing structural conditions such as biomass availability and existing infrastructure e. g. in the form of district heating systems. Furthermore the WPC variations are also affected by large differences in country specific electricity spot prices and variations regarding installation associated costs utilised in the calculations. Regarding the high German WPC value, it should be noted that large scale facilities in the Swedish and UK systems may render better financial figures if the total remuneration is calculated as the German system has a capacity and output limit. The main factors limiting the entry of new actors on the examined bio energy markets are high capital costs and logistic issues. The associated high capital costs has traditionally incurred long pay off times ranging from 15 to 25 years which has often deterred bio energy investments or steered investors towards other renewable energy sources such as wind power. Biomass is also often a scattered resource which in combination with the biomass fuels bulk and relatively low energy content makes the fuel ill-suited for long transports. However, both logistical and capital issues may be overcome by future investments in truly large scale installations through economics of scale. Regardless of scale, an optimised feedstock solutions stand out as particularly important aspect both as uncovered by the interviews and by previous research. The feedstock logistical solution determines how much fuel a facility has available and thus it limits the financially viable plant scale as well as it directly affects fuel sourcing costs. The relative importance of an optimised sourcing solution is illustrated by the fact that forest residues delivered at plant generally costs twice as much as coal delivered at plant. Furthermore, the relative importance of the different investment deciding factors is influenced by the prevailing structural conditions on the examined markets. For example, feedstock or logistical issues are less likely to hamper investments on the Swedish market than on the UK market...|$|E

40|$|Currently, a {{wide range}} of {{strategies}} is implemented in different countries to increase the share of electricity from renewable energy sources: {{one of the most controversial}} discussions is whether trading-based (e. g. the recently announced Guarantee-of-Origin (GoO) trade) or technology-specific instruments (like feed-in tariffs (FIT) lead to preferable solutions for society. An important issue in this context is that both systems are actually marked-based and both systems are introduced by policy makers and, hence, create artifical market. Finally, in both systems the final electricity customers (or the tax payers) will have to cover the support costs. The core objective of this paper is to discuss the perspectives of quota-based GoO trade for an efficient and effective increase of RES-E in comparision to FIT. The analysis is based on a formal framework showing how instruments works using the computer model GREEN-X. A major focus is put on the analysis of additional extra costs for electricity consumers/tax papers. The major results of this analysis are: (i) The success stories of growth in RES-E in EU member states in recent years has been triggered by FIT implemented in a technology-specific manner at modest costs for European citizens. Compared to short term trading in renewable certificate markets the intrinsic stability of <b>feed-in</b> <b>systems</b> appears to be a key element for success.
