5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E
5|$|By November 1954, {{following}} {{the end of}} the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew to help meet the Australian military's international obligations had eased and the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> combine the syllabus of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting in the new year. No.1 IFTS was disbanded on 24January 1955, and its base facilities handed over to No.23 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito had improved dramatically, and the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> remove all single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester.

5|$|In early 1916, {{following}} the unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign, the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> expand {{the size of}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time there were two divisions in Egypt—the 1st and 2nd—and of these, one of them (the 1st) was split up to provide a cadre upon which to raise the 4th and 5th Divisions. Around this time the decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in Australia was also made and as a result the 3rd Division was officially raised on 2 February 1916.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Surgical {{decision-making}} is {{a complex}} process. First, a medical <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine if surgery is necessary. Second, another medical <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine the type of surgery. Third, a corporate <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> if such a surgery is financially feasible. Finally, a legal <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> proceed or refuse the chosen surgery. This paper examines these issues {{in the case of}} surgery for medically intractable epilepsy and proposes a method of decision analysis to guide epilepsy surgery. Materials and Methods: A stochastic game of imperfect information using techniques of game theory and <b>decision</b> analysis <b>is</b> introduced as an analytical tool for surgical decision-making. Results: Surgery for appropriately chosen patients suffering from medically intractable epilepsy may not only be feasible, but may be the best medical option and the best financial option for the patient, families, society and the healthcare system. Such a situation would then make it legally or ethically difficult to reject or postpone surgery for these patients. Conclusions: A process to collect data to quantify the parameters used in the <b>decision</b> analysis <b>is</b> hereby proposed...|$|R
