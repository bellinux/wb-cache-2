25|$|In {{the case}} of an upflow {{anaerobic}} sludge blanket digestion (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid retention times can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times {{with the use of a}} sludge blanket. Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow <b>excess</b> <b>material</b> to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.|$|E
25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and <b>excess</b> <b>material.</b> The molding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the molding sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E

MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, {{and a special}} eight pointed wrench was required to remove it. The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust {{the height of the}} stem. MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{all high}} energy density cathodes for {{rechargeable}} lithium batteries are well-ordered materials where lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li 1. 211 Mo 0. 467 Cr 0. 3 O 2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of certain diffusion channels that are active in disordered structures, but is unique to Li <b>excess</b> <b>materials.</b> This leads to a unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li <b>excess</b> <b>materials,</b> and opens up an exciting new direction for designing disordered electrode materials with high capacity and {{high energy density}}...|$|R

500|$|Fabric {{shortage}} {{continued for}} some time {{after the end of}} the war. Two-piece swimsuits without the usual skirt panel and other <b>excess</b> <b>material</b> started appearing in the US when the government ordered a 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. By that time, two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, Life shows women in Paris wearing similar items. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear. Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed. The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around au naturel while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. Life magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, [...] "The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable." ...|$|E
500|$|The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, {{beyond the}} frost line, {{which is the}} point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the {{material}} is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to [...] within about 3million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe {{it is no accident}} that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5AU from the Sun. This <b>excess</b> <b>material</b> coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate. [...] Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150Earth masses ~105years thereafter and finally topping out at [...] [...] Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.|$|E

Drawing {{on a number of}} case studies from the Italian winemaking industry, I demonstrate the legislative creation of waste from the by-products of winemaking such as grape marc and vine wood. By physically removing bio-wastes from the socio-material context of their production, the current legislation privileges capital and technologically intensive methods for the management of bio-wastes. This process results in environmental contradictions and an unequal distribution of economic and societal benefits from the utilization of these materials. What is needed, I argue, is the incorporation of <b>excess</b> <b>materials</b> into thinking about local agro-ecologies as environmentally, economically and culturally sustainable...|$|R

40|$|Building {{design and}} {{construction}} has found many interested parties in nearly all {{sectors of the economy}} of the Indonesia. Various studies in developed countries have indicated that one method of improving construction project performance is by managing the construction waste. Project performance can be improved by reducing the unnecessary costs related to waste disposal and <b>excess</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the issues of construction waste have not been a main concern of construction project stakeholders in Indonesia. The Civil Engineering Department of the University of Indonesia has initiated the study on construction waste management in Indonesia. This paper discusses the results from one of the study, which is on construction waste minimization strategy. The main objective of construction waste minimization strategy is {{to reduce the amount of}} waste produced, which will lead to more cost effective project operation. This is based on concept that reduced construction waste can: save project cost, reduce <b>excess</b> <b>materials,</b> improve competitiveness, improve work habit, and improve quality of project environment. Construction waste minimization strategy can be implemented at 4 construction areas, namely project planning, preconstruction, off-site activities and on-site activities.

40|$|The {{international}} {{community in the}} post-Cold War period has {{expressed an interest in}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) using its expertise in support of the arms control and disarmament process in unprecedented ways. The pledges of the US and Russian presidents to place <b>excess</b> defense <b>materials</b> under some type of international inspections raises the prospect of using IAEA safeguards approaches for monitoring <b>excess</b> <b>materials,</b> which include both classified and unclassified materials. Although the IAEA has suggested the need to address inspections of both types of materials, the most troublesome and potentially difficult problems involve approaches to the inspection of classified materials. The key issue for placing classified nuclear components and materials under IAEA safeguards is the conflict between these traditional IAEA materials accounting procedures and the US classification laws and nonproliferation policy designed to prevent the disclosure of critical weapon-design information. Possible verification approaches to classified <b>excess</b> defense <b>materials</b> could be based on item accountancy, attributes measurements, and containment and surveillance. Such approaches are not wholly new; in fact, they are quite well established for certain unclassified materials. Such concepts may be applicable to classified items, but the precise approaches have yet to be identified, fully tested, or evaluated for technical and political feasibility, or for their possible acceptability in an international inspection regime. Substantial work remains in these areas. This paper examines many of the challenges presented by international inspections of classified materials...|$|R
