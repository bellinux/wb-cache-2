25|$|In 2006, the SGR {{mechanism}} {{was scheduled}} to decrease physician payments by 4.4%. (This number results from a 7% decrease in physician payments times a 2.8% <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustment</b> increase.) Congress overrode this decrease in the Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-362), and held physician payments in 2006 at their 2005 levels. Similarly, another congressional act held 2007 payments at their 2006 levels, and HR 6331 held 2008 physician payments to their 2007 levels, and provided for a 1.1% increase in physician payments in 2009. Without further continuing congressional intervention, the SGR is expected to decrease physician payments from 25% to 35% {{over the next several}} years.|$|E
25|$|A property-related fee or {{charge is}} not “increased” for {{purposes}} of Proposition 218 when an agency does either {{or both of the}} following: (1) adjusts the amount of a property-related fee or charge in accordance with a schedule of adjustments, including a clearly defined formula for <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustment</b> that was adopted by the agency prior to November 6, 1996; or (2) implements or collects a previously approved property-related fee or charge so long as the fee or charge rate is not increased beyond the level previously approved by the agency, and the methodology previously approved by the agency is not revised so as to result in an increase in the amount being levied on any person or parcel of property.|$|E
25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustment</b> for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} inflation, the {{principle}} of nominalism applies: The courts do not make <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustments.</b> If, therefore, one owed R100 in 1990, it remains R100 today.

2500|$|A tax is not “increased” under Proposition 218 when a local {{government}} does {{either or both}} of the following: (1) adjusts the amount of a tax in accordance with a schedule of adjustments, including a clearly defined formula for <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustment</b> that was adopted by the {{local government}} prior to the effective date of Proposition 218 (November 6, 1996); or (2) implements or collects a previously approved tax so long as the tax rate is not increased beyond the level previously approved by the local government, and the methodology previously approved by the local government is not revised so as to result in an increase in the amount being levied on any person or parcel of property. [...] A tax is also not “increased” under Proposition 218 in the case in which the actual payments from a person or property are higher than would have resulted when the local government approved the tax, if those higher payments are attributable to events other than an increased tax rate or revised methodology, such as a change in the density, intensity, or nature of the use of land.|$|E

40|$|Using {{different}} inflation measures produces economically {{significant differences}} in both the inflation record and inflation-adjusted stock returns. We introduce a more consistent measure of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate to better measure real returns over 1913 - 2004, for which the official CPI exists. We also extend the series backward to 1871 on a monthly basis, an important addition to the data series.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the {{consumer}} price index (CPI) is often a very poor measure of inflation rates relevant to individual senior households. A high proportion of the inflation rates measured by household-specific price indexes falls more than one percentage point above or below the CPI inflation rate.

Finally, I estimate costs of oversta ting <b>inflation</b> <b>adjustments</b> to Canada Pension Plan. ...|$|R
