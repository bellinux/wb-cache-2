5000|$|Tsar {{formed in}} 1998 and soon won {{favorable}} reviews for their energetic gigs and anthemic songwriting. After a monthlong residency at Silver Lake's Spaceland club and a label bidding war, they released their self-titled debut on Hollywood Records (2000), produced by Grammy Producer of the Year Rob Cavallo (<b>Green</b> Day, <b>Goo</b> Goo Dolls) and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge (U2, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna). The album garnered critical acclaim {{and an international}} cult following, although it was commercially disappointing. AllMusic describes the album and its fate thusly: [...] "Tsar {{is a bit of}} a glam pop/hard rock hidden treasure that still sounds fresh and thrilling years later. Loaded with hooks, humor, and innocent charm, and coming across like the starry-eyed child of Cheap Trick and Sweet [...] [...] [...] the album was an exciting, hook-filled modern power pop record that nobody bought, despite (or perhaps because of) the band's subsequent opening slot on a Duran Duran tour." ...|$|R
