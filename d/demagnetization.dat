However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to <b>demagnetization,</b> as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments.

Clear convergence of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was observed for only 82 samples (17 %) from 8 sites. They were dolerites, tonalites, syenites and hornblendites, all having NRM strength more than 10 ^ Am^ 2 /kg. Samples less than 10 ^ Am^ 2 /kg, including granites, granitic rocks and granitic dike or vein, yielded no paleomagnetically significant results. The virtual geomagnetic pole positions (VGP) from 1550 nunatak dolerite, Brattnipene dolerite and Lunckeryggen syenite fall on a fairly small area, well matching with reported ones from Pingvinane granite and some rocks in the Sor Rondane Mountains. Their radiometric ages are confined to early Ordovician. On the other hand, the Ordovician VGPs from elsewhere in East Antarctica are significantly deviated from those from the Sor Rondane Mountains These facts lead us to a conclusion that {{the mass of the}} Sor Rondane Mountains was undeformed locally, but tilted as a whole relatively to the rest mass in East Antarctica. A Precambrian VGP, 60. 4 °S, 21. 5 °W in 662 ± 23 Ma, was estimated from magnetically cleaned remanences and a newly determined ^ Ar-^ Ar age of Nils Larsenfjellet tonalites, with further proposing of an apparent polar-wander path (APWP) for Precambrian to Cambro-Ordovician from Nils Larsenfjellet. No attempt of thermal <b>demagnetizations</b> and other methods of the rockmagnetism have been done to verify the quality of the magnetically cleaned remanence.

Stepwise thermal <b>demagnetizations</b> of 22 new sites together with previously published data from 25 sites (sampled in Bartonian-Priabonian sediments) define reliable primary directions in the region allowing for potential vertical axis rotations estimation. The comparison between the deformed and the pre-deformational states in the cross-sections agrees with the paleomagnetic data in that neither gradient of shortening, nor significant vertical axis rotations can be invoked to explain the along-strike changes of the main structures (folds and thrusts) linked to the South-Pyrenean Frontal thrust, west of the western termination of the External Sierras. Therefore, these changes are here interpreted {{as the result of a}} wedge thrust in the Paleozoic basement, whose displacements in transferred to the Mesozoic-Tertiary cover through the Upper Triassic detachment level.

In this paper, we present a multidisciplinary study, combining geochronology, petrology, rock magnetism and palaeomagnetism, carried out on Oligocene to Early Miocene ignimbrites and related flows from {{the southern part of the}} Sierra Madre Occidental. Two new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages were determined for ignimbrites; 20. 4 ± 0. 2 Ma (the youngest age obtained so far in this area) and 29. 2 ± 0. 5 Ma. Density measurements, as a proxy for welding, proved to be extremely useful to estimate the emplacement temperature and the origin of the magnetizations carried by the ignimbrites. After alternating field and thermal <b>demagnetizations,</b> the mean palaeomagnetic pole (Lat = 66. 8 °N; Long = 180. 5 °E; Kappa = 142; A 95 = 6. 3 °), calculated for the period 28 - 31 Ma, is in close agreement with our only Miocene determination.

40|$|Viscous {{magnetization}} (VM) and viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) {{have been}} measured, {{as a function}} of temperature, between room temperature and the Curie temperature using a suite of well-characterized synthetic and natural multidomain (MD) magnetite samples. Particular attention was given to possible diffusion aftereffects such as dislocation creep (stress relaxation) and disaccommodation (vacancy and ionic reordering) and their contribution to viscous behavior in what has been commonly thought of as a purely thermal fluctuation process. Dislocation creep was examined by measuring viscosity before and after annealing. Annealing was found to reduce the non-log(t) behavior, where t is time. Non-log(t) behavior has been associated with diffusion aftereffects, suggesting that these are a major contributor to viscosity and (de) magnetization processes in MD samples. The positive curvature of the non-log(t) acquisition processes indicates that dislocation creep dominates over disaccommodation. This does not imply that VM and VRM are due solely to dislocation creep, but rather that VRM and VM reflect a number of unrelated temperature-dependent processes, primarily thermal fluctuations and dislocation creep. This {{is the first time that}} dislocation creep has been directly identified as contributing to viscosity at temperature. These findings will have particular implications for paleointensity determinations, as on heating a sample, its dislocation structure may relax, giving rise to <b>demagnetizations</b> not associated with thermal fluctuations. This will lead to incorrect intensity estimates.

The overall dispersion of palaeomagnetic directions (declination ranging between ∼N 0 º and ∼N 50 º) and their migration observed during stepwise <b>demagnetizations</b> have revealed the superposition of remanence components. We interpret this complex palaeomagnetic behaviour as related to the regional hydrothermalism associated with the last stages of Late Cretaceous magmatic activity. This environment favoured mineralogical alteration and a partial chemical remagnetization, giving in most samples a composite magnetization, which has been erroneously interpreted as the primary one in a previous study, then leading to a questionable model for Cretaceous Iberia rotation. Nonetheless, for some samples a single component has been isolated. Interesting rock magnetic properties and microscopic observations point to a well-preserved magnetic mineralogy for these samples, with magnetite clearly of primary origin.

A middle-temperature Component M is post-folding and was likely acquired during low-temperature oxidation at 65 – 35  Ma. A high-temperature Component H is pre-folding, but its comparison with the paleomagnetic data from coeval rocks in the northern Tamworth terrane on the other limb of Texas Orocline does not indicate rotations around a vertical axis, as expected from geological data. A likely explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that Component H postdates the oroclinal bending, but predates folding in late stages of the 265 – 230  Ma Hunter Bowen Orogeny. The post-Kiaman age of Component H {{is supported by the}} presence of an alternating paleomagnetic polarity in the studied rocks.

Rock magnetic studies suggest that the dominant magnetic mineral is relatively pure pseudo-single-domain magnetite.

The dunites and the harzburgites have median natural remanent magnetization val-ues of 3. 2 and 1. 2 A/m and magnetic susceptibility values of 0. 053 and 0. 023 (S 1 volume units), respectively. The NRM is the dominant component of magnetization and has a magnitude similar to values observed for oceanic basalts of Layer 2 a.
