5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry may {{have come to the}} castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, bows and arrows.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} threat {{passed and}} in 1553 {{all of the}} blockhouses were ordered to return their guns; Milton and Higham were demolished. In the summer of 1588, however, there was a fresh threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada. An army was mobilised to protect {{the mouth of the}} estuary and emergency improvements to the fortifications at Tilbury Blockhouse were made by Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> the fort by barge on 8 August 1588 and rode in procession to the nearby army camp, where she gave a speech to the assembled forces. Fears of invasion continued even after the defeat of the Armada, and {{over the course of the}} next year the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli, reinforced the blockhouse with probably two concentric earthwork ramparts, with ditches and a palisade. A boom was stretched across the river to Gravesend at a cost of £305.|$|E

Charles I was welcomed into Hull to inspect the fortifications and arsenal in 1639. In April 1642 the King returned to Hull to secure the arsenal at Hull, but was refused admittance at Beverley Gate by John Hotham.|$|E
25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E

In 1577 the explorer Martin Frobisher arrived in the city with two ships and samples of ore, which proved to be worthless.

500|$|A trilogy {{of young}} adult novels, The Whitby Witches, makes {{much of the}} town's setting and history, embellishing local traditions whilst {{incorporating}} them into the narrative. The author, Robin Jarvis, recalls [...] "The first time <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Whitby, I stepped off the train and knew I was somewhere very special. It was a grey, drizzling day but that only added to the haunting beauty and lonely atmosphere of the place. Listening to Carmina Burana on my headphones, I explored the ruined abbey on the clifftop. The place was a fantastic inspiration. In the Whitby Witches I have interwoven many of the existing local legends, such as the frightening Barguest, whilst inventing {{a few of my}} own, most notably the aufwaders." [...] Jarvis returned to Whitby for his 2016 novel, The Power of Dark, the first in The Witching Legacy series.|$|E
500|$|De Burgh finally {{fell out}} of favour with Henry III; he was imprisoned and then finally {{stripped}} of Hadleigh Castle in 1239. For {{the rest of the}} century, Hadleigh was retained as a royal castle, as part of an estate containing [...] of agricultural land, the park and the castle mill. By the 1250s, the castle had fallen into neglect and, despite some investment after it was given to Queen Eleanor in 1273, it remained in relatively poor condition. Only the mill, vital for the operation of the wider estate, appears to have been well-maintained. A new 17-metre-wide by 9-metre-long (56 foot by 30 foot) hall and an adjacent solar complex were built at the castle around 1290, but collapsed due to subsidence shortly afterwards. In 1299 the castle was given to Queen Margaret, who complained {{about the quality of the}} building and insisted that repairs were carried out. Her husband, Edward <b>I,</b> <b>visited</b> the castle twice, using it as a base for hunting in the area.|$|E

500|$|In March 1643, Temple had {{returned}} to Sussex, and along with his stepbrother, John Busbridge, he was appointed by Parliament to the Sussex committee set for the sequestration (i.e. seizure and administration) of the assets of prominent Royalists. In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, who did that day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the country and I did not marvel at it, for {{he is a man}} that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as full of success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E

500|$|As part of {{the annual}} Guild Day {{procession}} of the inauguration of the new mayor of Norwich it was tradition for the head boy to deliver a short speech in Latin from the school porch [...] "commending justice and obedyence" [...] to the mayor and corporation. Afterwards the orator would attend the guild dinner, historically riding in the procession on a white horse, but in later years taken in the mayor's carriage. When Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Norwich on a separate occasion in 1578 the master at the time, Stephen Limbert, {{is said to have}} delivered an oration, which [...] "so pleased Her Majesty that she said it had been the best she had heard, and gave him her hand to kiss, and afterwards sent back to enquire his name." [...] The encounter has been said to characterise the public image of Elizabeth I as a monarch who indulged her subjects with goodwill and has been used for the interpretation of the character of Theseus in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

500|$|Warwick Castle {{had fallen}} into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not {{initiate}} any repairs to the castle. Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> the castle in 1566 during {{a tour of the}} country, and again in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, left the castle to the Queen during her visits. When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings, including the chapel. In 1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that [...] "the little stone building there was, mightily in decay... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a name of Warwick". Greville was granted Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604.|$|E
500|$|The {{area which}} is now Tunbridge Wells {{was part of the}} parish of Speldhurst for {{hundreds}} of years, but the origin of the town as it is today, however, came in the seventeenth century. In 1606 Dudley, Lord North, a courtier to James I who was staying at a hunting lodge in Eridge {{in the hope that the}} country air might improve his ailing constitution, discovered a chalybeate spring. He drank from the spring and, when his health improved, he became convinced that it had healing properties. He persuaded his rich friends in London to try it, and by the time Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles <b>I,</b> <b>visited</b> in 1630 it had established itself as a spa retreat. By 1636 it had become so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors, one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen, and in 1664 Lord Muskerry, Lord of the Manor, enclosed it with a triangular stone wall, and built a hall [...] "to shelter the dippers in wet weather." ...|$|E
