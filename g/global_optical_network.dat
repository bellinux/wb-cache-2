40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} provide cost {{effective}} transport services for highly demanding dataintensive grid applications, National Research Networks (NRNs) are considering additional types of access to their network infrastructures. Next to traditional IP access, NRNs like to provide automated, grid application driven access to their underlying connection-oriented network infrastructure. This combination is called hybrid networking. Recently, both NRNs and grid communities started to acquire their own <b>global</b> <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> connections. A Lambda Grid was created when these organizations decided to interconnect these links via interconnection points such as Starlight and Netherlight. Apart from supporting scientific applications, the Lambda Grid allows network research. Within this context, this paper will present a novel token-based path selection mechanism that will enable authorized access to Lambda Grid links. The token-based approach allows temporal separation of the path authorization process from obtaining access to a Lambda Grid link. The path authorization process may involve many parties and complex, time consuming decisions whereas path access requires a fast real-time implementation. We will describe {{the application of the}} tokenbased approach for an interconnection point between a Hybrid Network and a Lambd...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{views on}} the future of optical networking. A historical look at the emergence of optical networking is first taken, followed by a discussion on the drivers pushing for a new and pervasive network, which is based on photonics and can satisfy the needs of a broadening base of residential, business, and scientific users. Regional plans and targets for optical networking are reviewed to understand which current approaches are judged important. Today, two thrusts are driving separate optical network infrastructure models, namely 1) the need by nations to provide a ubiquitous network infrastructure to support all the future services and telecommunication needs of residential and business users and 2) increasing demands by the scientific community for networks to support their requirements with respect to large-scale data transport and processing. This paper discusses these network models together with the key enabling technologies currently being considered for future implementation, including optical circuit, burst and packet switching, and optical code-division multiplexing. Critical subsystem functionalities are also reviewed. The discussion considers how these separate models might eventually merge to form a <b>global</b> <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{successful}} {{design of}} an <b>Optical</b> Deep Space <b>Network</b> (ODSN) greatly {{depends on the}} selection of optimal telescope sites. At the highest system level, {{there are two main}} factors to consider in the design of a <b>global</b> <b>optical</b> communications <b>network</b> for deep space applications: telescope size (Le., aperture size) and the distance between stations. The size of the individual telescope aperture needs to be selected based on mission needs (e. g., maximization of received photons per bit). At the same time, because of weather effects and Earth rotation, a number of telescopes have to be placed within certain distances around the Earth in order to achieve global coverage. The distance between the adjacent telescopes is driven by other secondary factors, which are basically derived requirements from: 1) outage tolerance; 2) continuity in data stream; 3) operational cost...|$|R

It demonstrates the reliability and viability of photonic technologies and management functions in a trial representative of a global network infrastructure. The core network is a transparent all-optical meshed network with wavelength crossconnects partly 2 R-regenerating, operating at 2. 5 and 10 Gb/s, and supporting various protection schemes including 1 : N shared OCH protection, The metropolitan network is a ring composed of OADMs supporting OMS protection. The interconnection to the SuperPON access network is made through an ATM switch. The ATM-based SuperPON supports a dynamic Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. For the first time, a 10 Gb/s wavelength-converted connection was demonstrated in the field in a transparent all-optical managed network. The field trial has demonstrated many points of progress as compared to the previous state of the art: cascadability experiments in a real network with reasonable distances and low compensation, various node functions, interworking of various equipment types, new optical protection, and dynamic MAC protocol. The (transport) TMN/Q 3 integrated management system played an important role to achieve the network experiments: it allowed us to provision and reconfigure the end-to-end optical paths very quickly (< 3 s) from the centralized management platform.

As the number of satellite operators and researches in this field is large, it makes sense to set up a sensor network with multiple entities to combine all available sensor measurements for a comprehensive situational picture.
