During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of <b>insertion</b> of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor <b>insertion</b> in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent <b>insertion</b> of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that <b>insertion</b> from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river.

The crystal structures of Thermotoga maritima Ψ 55 S, and its complex with RNA, have been determined at 2. 9 and 3. 0 Å resolutions, respectively. Structural comparisons with other families of pseudouridine synthases (ΨS) indicate that Ψ 55 S may acquire {{its ability to}} recognize a stem–loop RNA substrate by two <b>insertions</b> of polypeptides into the ΨS core. The structure of apo-Ψ 55 S reveals that these two <b>insertions</b> interact with each other.

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the human and Drosophila melanogaster genomes are heterochromatic, yet we {{know very little about}} the {{structure}} and function of this enigmatic component of eukaryotic genomes. To facilitate molecular and cytological analysis of heterochromatin we introduced a yellow(+) (y(+)) -marked P element into centric heterochromatin by screening for variegated phenotypes, that is, mosaic gene inactivation. We recovered > 110 P <b>insertions</b> with variegated yellow expression from approximately 3500 total mobilization events. FISH analysis of 71 of these <b>insertions</b> showed that 69 (97 %) were in the centric heterochromatin, rather than telomeres or euchromatin. High-resolution banding analysis showed a wide but nonuniform distribution of <b>insertions</b> within centric heterochromatin; variegated <b>insertions</b> were predominantly recovered near regions of satellite DNA. We successfully used inverse PCR to clone and sequence the flanking DNA for approximately 63 % of the <b>insertions.</b> BLAST analysis of the flanks demonstrated that either most of the variegated <b>insertions</b> could not be placed on the genomic scaffold, and thus may be inserted within novel DNA sequence, or that the flanking DNA hit multiple sites on the scaffold, due to <b>insertions</b> within different transposons. Taken together these data suggest that screening for yellow variegation is a very efficient method for recovering centric <b>insertions</b> and that a large-scale screen for variegated yellow P <b>insertions</b> will provide important tools for detailed analysis of centric heterochromatin structure and function...|$|R

40|$|SummaryTwo {{abundant}} {{classes of}} mobile elements, namely Alu and L 1 elements, continue to generate new retrotransposon <b>insertions</b> in human genomes. Estimates {{suggest that these}} elements have generated millions of new germline <b>insertions</b> in individual human genomes worldwide. Unfortunately, current technologies are not capable of detecting most of these young <b>insertions,</b> and the true extent of germline mutagenesis by endogenous human retrotransposons {{has been difficult to}} examine. Here, we describe technologies for detecting these young retrotransposon <b>insertions</b> and demonstrate that such <b>insertions</b> indeed are abundant in human populations. We also found that new somatic L 1 <b>insertions</b> occur at high frequencies in human lung cancer genomes. Genome-wide analysis suggests that altered DNA methylation may be responsible for the high levels of L 1 mobilization observed in these tumors. Our data indicate that transposon-mediated mutagenesis is extensive in human genomes and is likely to {{have a major impact on}} human biology and diseases...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the factors (selective or mutational) {{that affect the}} distribution of transposable elements (TEs) within a genome, {{it is necessary to}} compare the pattern of newly arising element <b>insertions</b> to the pattern of element <b>insertions</b> that have been fixed in a population. To do this, we analyzed the distribution of recent mutant <b>insertions</b> of the Tc 1, Tc 3, and Tc 5 elements in a mut- 7 background of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and compared it to the distribution of element <b>insertions</b> (presumably fixed) within the sequenced genome. Tc 1 elements preferentially insert in regions with high recombination rates, whereas Tc 3 and Tc 5 do not. Although Tc 1 and Tc 3 both insert in TA dinucleotides, there is no clear relationship between the frequency of <b>insertions</b> and the TA dinucleotide density. There is a strong selection against TE <b>insertions</b> within coding regions: the probability that a TE will be fixed is at least 31 times lower in coding regions than in noncoding regions. Contrary to the prediction of theoretical models, we found that the selective pressure against TE <b>insertions</b> does not increase with the recombination rate. These findings indicate that the distribution of these three transposon families in the genome of C. elegans is determined essentially by just two factors: the pattern of <b>insertions,</b> which is a characteristic of each family, and the selection against <b>insertions</b> within coding regions...|$|R
