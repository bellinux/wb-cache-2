40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{utilization of}} heat from waste water in sewage. During the year, temperature {{of water in}} sewage ranges between 10 °C and 20 °C and the heat from sewage {{could be used for}} heating, cooling and hot water preparation in building. The heat is extracted through a transfer surface area of the heat exchanger into the heat pump, which is able to utilize the low–potential energy. Different design and types of the heat exchangers in sewage are dealt with: heat exchangers embedded in sewage pipe, heat exchanger integrated in concrete wall of a sewage pipe, sewer pipe with special <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> as well as double pipe heat exchanger. Technical data about usage of the heat exchangers is also specified...|$|R

500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{may also be}} used to connect a fire engine to a hydrant. [...] This {{practice}} is common in Australia, but woven <b>jacket</b> fire <b>hose</b> is normally used for this purpose in the United States. [...] Using hard suction hose in this manner requires that the fire engine be positioned carefully for the limited flexibility of the hose, and may require multiple firefighters due to the weight and bulk of the hose section. In certain circumstances, {{it may be possible to}} use hard suction hose to draft from a hydrant with adequate water supply but a low flow rate.|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s onwards, truckers and {{mechanics}} wore a distinctive outfit comprising mechanic's cap, white T shirt, bandana, boiler suit, checked shirt, leather coat, Pendleton <b>jacket,</b> <b>double</b> denim <b>jacket,</b> and blue jeans. The skipper cap in particular signified the truckers' {{link with the}} big seaports, from which imported goods were transported all over the country. This look served as {{the inspiration for the}} ton-up boy, raggare, and greaser subculture during the 1950s and 1960s. By the early 1980s, the peaked caps had been replaced with foam and mesh baseball caps known as trucker hats or gimme caps, which were originally given to truck drivers by manufacturers such as John Deere, Mountain Dew or Budweiser to advertise their products.|$|R

50|$|The reefer {{jacket was}} of naval origin, and {{described}} the short <b>double</b> breasted <b>jacket</b> worn by sailors in harsh weather, when they perform duties such as reefing the sails.

Originally with black horn buttons, these jackets evolved to the modern dark blazer, now single as well as double breasted, and with metallic buttons.|$|R
50|$|Pipe band uniforms {{vary from}} band to band. However, the typical uniform {{consists}} of a glengarry (cap), shirt, tie, waistcoat (vest), <b>jacket,</b> kilt, <b>hose</b> and dress shoes. Each pipe band has its own signature tartan that may reflect the area the band originated from or {{the history of the}} band. Jackets and waistcoats are usually black, and shirts are often short-sleeved for comfort. Each band also has its own tie, which can match the kilt tartan, or is sometimes merely a block colour. In competition, appearing smart in uniform is essential; some competitions have dress codes, for instance certain types of jackets only, ties must be knotted at the collar and so on.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: Single pot mixer–{{granulator}}–dryer (high-shear granulator with in situ <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> vacuum drying) and multiphase equipments (high-shear granulator {{associated with}} fluid bed dryer) are classically used for wet granulation. At present time, industrial production imperatives may require to switch one formulation from one equipment to another. Method: To {{compare the two}} processes and to define, for each of them, the optimal formulation domain, experiments were organized according to Doehlert experimental designs. Response surfaces were used to identify the levels of each factor (binder and filler ratios) inducing the more satisfying responses. The contribution of binder and filler ratios to granule properties was highlighted according to the process. Then the desirability function {{was used to determine}} and compare the optimal formulation domain for each process. Results and conclusion: In the studied formulation domain and for the considered equipments, the transposition from a single pot to a multiphase highshear granulation process did not seem to raise difficulties; the same formulations were out of specification for both processes and other trials, the technological properties were maintained or improved in the Fielder®/Niro® equipment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{photocatalytic}} {{properties of}} commercialized self-cleaning glasses {{have been evaluated}} by the degradation of stearic acid C 17 H 35 COOH (SA), selected as a model molecule representative of fatty dirt. The relative amount of SA has been determined by measuring the FTIR peak area in the range 2752 and 2992 cm− 1 corresponding to the C–H stretching bands. In order to estimate the thickness of one layer, the deposit of SA has been performed using the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method, which allows obtaining organized monomolecular layers of amphiphilic organics on a substrate. The thickness of one SA layer, obtained by Langmuir–Blodgett deposition, has been correlated to the FTIR signal. The photocatalytic degradation of a SA layer of a controlled thickness {{was carried out in}} a <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> Pyrex reactor equipped with a UV Philips HPK 125 lamp. The photocatalytic degradation rate of the SA layer with different thicknesses was determined. The SA degradation rate was investigated under UV-A and UV-B irradiations to determine the influence of the photon wavelength range on efficiency...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{specific}} mechanical energy (SME) and dough temperature {{at the end}} of mixing (Tf) on semisweet biscuit dough characteristics and biscuit quality were studied using an experimental mixer fitted with monitoring devices. The fluid circulating in the <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> of the mixing bowl was regulated at variable temperatures and mixed dough samples were prepared at Tf of 23, 30, and 37 °C for three levels of SME input (20, 60 and 120 kJ/kg). Correlation analysis showed that semisweet biscuit length and thickness were independent quality parameters, influenced respectively by the Tf of dough and SME. Biscuit thickness and volume increased with SME input, but SME had no significant influence on the physicochemical characteristics of the dough. Biscuit length was related to the density and stickiness of the dough and to rheological behavior as assessed by fundamental and empirical measurements. A rise in dough temperature > 35 °C induced a dramatic increase in viscoelastic properties, leading to biscuit shrinkage. The increase of dough density with Tf seemed {{to be related to the}} melting of solid fat in the dough recipe. Melting of fat during mixing could also be a source of viscoelastic changes in the dough at Tf...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAt present time, {{industrial}} production imperatives can require the transposition of a formulation from one equipment to another. In order {{to evaluate the}} impact of such a switch on the properties of granules and tablets, investigations were undertaken on formulations manufactured both in a single pot mixer-granulator-dryer (high shear granulator with in situ <b>double</b> <b>jacket</b> vacuum drying) and in a multiphase equipment (high shear granulator/fluid bed dryer). Principal component analysis highlighted the major contribution of the binder ratio on granule size distribution, flow and packing ability whereas the relative ratio of mannitol and lactose, used as fillers, mainly impacted on compressibility and tablet cohesion. In the studied domain, the lubricant ratio did not explain the considered responses. Statistical analysis (comparison of means, analysis of variance and PCA) showed that both processes led to products with similar characteristics which demonstrated {{the ability of the}} processes to produce granules with close quality. However, Fielder 1 /Niro 1 granule characteristic data were found to be more dispersed, thus demonstrating a higher sensitivity of the multiphase process to formulation changes. Technological properties of granules and tablets were found to be maintained or improved therefore securing the switch from single pot to multiphase equipment...|$|R
