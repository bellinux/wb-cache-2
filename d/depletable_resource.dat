In the present study, we examined the role of serotonin activity and social norms in the management of <b>depletable</b> <b>resources.</b> Healthy adults, alongside social partners, completed a multiplayer resource-dilemma game in which they repeatedly harvested from a partially replenishable monetary resource. Dietary tryptophan depletion, leading to reduced serotonin activity, was associated with aggressive harvesting strategies and disrupted use of the social norms given by distributions of other players' harvests. Tryptophan-depleted participants more frequently exhausted the resource completely and also accumulated fewer rewards than participants who were not tryptophan depleted.

40|$|Heal's theorem {{states that}} if the {{extraction}} cost of a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> increases with cumulative extraction, and if a backstop technology exists, the user cost of the <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> declines to zero at the date of exhaustion. In this paper, we first present a simple method for proving this proposition, using a social planning model that determines the optimal rates both of extrac-tion of the <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> and of production of the backstop technology. We then present two examples that show how this method {{can be used to}} solve more difficult problems in the theory of resource economics.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{theoretical}} model that can account for price fluctuations in <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> markets. We do so by introducing learning into a Hotelling-style duopoly model of optimal resource depletion. Before the depletable re-source becomes scarce, the self-confirming equilibrium of the model mirrors noncooper-ative rational expectations equilibrium in that supply is high and price is low, although learning does induce occasional upward price spikes that are followed by a long period of falling price. Once the <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> becomes scarce the dynamics of the mar-ket change significantly, with the self-confirming equilibrium mirroring the cooperative rather than noncooperative rational expectations equilibrium. Supply is low and price is high. Price spikes still occur but against a background of increasing prices. When scarcity is sufficient then the market is permanently in a self-confirming equilibrium that is equivalent to cooperative rational expectations equilibrium. ∗We thank participants at the European Summer Symposium in Macroeconomics (Izmir 2007) for helpful comments and suggestions. 1...|$|E

A discussion of prominent policy issues in this arena is provided, along with an indication of what academic economics papers have contributed to that debate. This is followed by a citation analysis of contributions in the fields of energy and exhaustible resource economics. For each of these two fields, a list of the top papers in each five year period from 1974 to 1998 is presented, along with a list of the top journals in each decade, based on average citations per article.

40|$|This {{paper has}} a {{two-fold}} purpose. The wider and more abstract purpose is estimating the long-run marginal {{cost of producing}} a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource.</b> The second purpose is the illumination of several important policy issues dealing {{with the development of}} coal resources. The essence of depletion is the movement from cheaper to more costly deposits. Econometric models estimated from past observations on prices and outputs cannot capture this movement, since the past reflects only the more favorable deposits. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a situation where}} a strategic seller of a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> faces price-taking buyers who, through their government, can adopt technologies perma-nently ending the resource dependence. Adoption is irreversible and changes the demand infrastructure after a time lag.

When seller’s stock is imperfectly observed, supplies can increase to a privately known supply shock triggering the infrastructure change. Results suggest that security-of-supply policies can stem from the strategic behavior...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of the {{exploration}} and development activities of a National Oil Company (NOC), which uses similar technology to a private firm to extract a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource.</b> However, unlike the private firm, the NOC may have a wider range of objectives than maximizing the present value of profits. Specifically, we assume an objective function that balances firm profitability against a political desire to favor domestic consumer surplus and domestic employment.

40|$|Pricing {{behavior}} at three Hudson's Bay Company trading posts is examined {{in terms of}} a model of long-run profit maximization of a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource.</b> At Fort Churchill, where the company acted as a monopsonist purchaser of furs from the Indians, rising European fur prices had little impact on prices paid to Indians and beaver stocks in the hinterland were maintained. At Fort Albany and York Factory, where the company faced competition from French traders, prices at the posts were raised and the beaver was depleted. These outcomes are consistent with optimal pricing behavior by the company. The lack of well-defined Native property rights to the beaver was a crucial element. ...|$|E
40|$|According to the ego-depletion {{account of}} loss of {{self-control}}, self-control is, or depends on, a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource.</b> Advocates of this account have argued that what is depleted is actually glucose.

I suggest that glucose restores self-control not because it is a resource on which it relies, but because it serves as a signal of environment quality. I suggest that the evidence is better explained by a rival opportunity costs model of self-control than by the ego-depletion account. 13 page(s...|$|E

Moreover, if an economy has reached a steady state and a resource discovery is made the economy will converge to a new steady state with a higher level of consumption.

It suggests treating natural resources entering reserves as “imports” from the environmental account added to the capital account, registering additions to reserves at a stage involved in economic activities, and valuing reserves by procedures related to market price. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} a dynamic optimization model {{to describe the}} supply of a <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> within an economy. An implementable version of the model {{is applied to the}} dynamic allocation of coal supply to the U. S. energy sector for the period 1979 - 2000. Several primary energy sources, including coal, oil, gas, and nuclear power, are considered in a linear programming process model of the energy-producing sector. The supply of coal appears to be particularly sensitive to the future pattern of nuclear power capacity escalation, and less so to escalations in oil import prices. The latter observation depends, however, on the rate of substitution of coal for oil and gas to process heat and petrochemicals. ...|$|E

However, with other forms of consumer demand, the monopolist may exhaust the resource more quickly, especially if many new options will follow. These results may apply especially to <b>depletable</b> <b>resources</b> like antibiotics or biotech products, for which significant research and development costs are required, followed by monopoly rights conferred by patents.

40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} {{have found that}} exercising self-control reduces success on subsequent, seemingly unrelated self-control tasks. Such evidence lends support to a strength model that posits a limited and <b>depletable</b> <b>resource</b> underlying all manner of self-control. Recent theory and evidence suggest that exercising self-control may also increase approach-motivated impulse strength. The two studies reported here tested two implications of this increased approach motivation hypothesis. First, aftereffects of self-control should be evident even in responses that require little or no self-control. Second, participants higher in trait approach motivation should be particularly susceptible to such aftereffects. In support, exercising self-control led to increased optimism (Study 1) and broadened attention (Study 2), but only among individuals higher in trait approach motivation. These findings suggest that approach motivation is an important key to understanding the aftereffects of exercising self-control.
