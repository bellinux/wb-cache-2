500|$|Dooley {{is not a}} well {{established}} character in the comics, so Whigham created his own background for him, feeling that [...] "Dooley is [...] a political appointee. I think <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way up through good hard work." [...] Unlike {{many of the other}} agents, Whigham believes that Dooley does respect Carter, saying [...] "I think he likes her. I think he cares deeply. I'm not sure that he can always show that". When asked whether Dooley's death was what brings Carter and the other SSR agents together, Fazekas said that this was not necessarily the case, as Carter had already begun to earn that herself, but she did feel that it [...] "sort of focuses everyone and affects everyone".|$|E
500|$|As the {{psychologist}} and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, [...] "One aspect of [...] war record {{that is particularly}} confused, and again typical {{of the mixture of}} glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service." [...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E

6000|$|... "You lazy loafer!" [...] she cried, [...] "must <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>my</b> arms off {{washing and}} toiling for the ugly likes of you? Are you {{a man or}} are you a kitchen hound?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> {{way down}} into the {{waterway}} I felt sartin I would find Henry in some sort o' shape," [...] he concluded. [...] "But I couldn't find nuthin', not even his cap. His gun he dropped on the hill, an' here it is," [...] and {{he handed it to}} Dave.|$|E
60|$|Calling to Dejah Thoris to {{get behind}} me <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way toward the little doorway back of the throne, but the {{officers}} realized my intentions, and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position where I could have defended Dejah Thoris against any army of swordsmen.|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} form {{requires}} more than anything else, the maneuvering of self, sometimes putting the self forward, sometimes holding the self back, sometimes testifying, sometimes sticking to the facts, sometimes using fiction to tell the truthâ€¦As <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>my</b> way, the self is always there, demanding its negotiation...|$|R

60|$|The packed snow on {{the sill}} was {{drenching}} my knees as <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way out and prepared to drop. There was a deafening explosion inside the room, and simultaneously something seared my shoulder like a hot iron. I cried out with the pain of it, and, losing my balance, fell from the sill.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] said Flower, whose eloquence had {{received}} a chill, [...] "but there is little more to tell. I {{was picked up by}} a Russian brig bound for Riga, and lay there some time in a state of fever. When I got better <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> passage home in a timber boat and landed yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{reply was}} a quick thrust which left me but three antagonists and I {{can assure you that}} they were worthy of my metal. They had me backed against the wall in no time, {{fighting}} for my life. Slowly <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way to {{a corner of the room}} where I could force them to come at me only one at a time, and thus we fought upward of twenty minutes; the clanging of steel on steel producing a veritable bedlam in the little room.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> always doubt <b>my</b> <b>work.</b> <b>I</b> {{always have}} regrets. That's why <b>I</b> revise <b>my</b> <b>work</b> so much and, {{at the same}} time, I regret not being more {{prolific}}. But the reason I am not more prolific is because <b>I</b> doubt <b>my</b> <b>work</b> and {{spend a lot of}} time changing it. It's paradoxical, isn't it? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There remains, therefore, about L3,200 {{which has}} to be found within ten days. No man shall lose by me. I gave them my word {{in the room that}} if <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> soul out of my body every one of them should be paid. I shall not spend a penny upon myself until it is done. But some of them can't wait. They are poor men themselves, and must have their money. They have issued a warrant for Pearson's arrest. But they think that he has got away the States." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{might have}} followed, {{it is not}} easy to say, had not the loud, declamatory voice of the {{lecturer}} just then been heard, as he commenced his address. This appeared to be a signal for the tribe to make some movement, for the two fellows who had stopped me, walked silently away, though bag of calico went to bag of calico, as they trotted off together, seemingly communicating to each other their suspicions. I took advantage of the opening, and passed into the church, where <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way through the throng, and got a seat at my uncle's side.|$|E
6000|$|I {{should have}} got better prices if <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> things on wool or {{scratched}} them on camel-bone {{instead of using}} mere {{black and white and}} colour. Verily, they are a queer gang, these people. Limited isn't the word to describe 'em. I met a fellow the other day who {{told me that it was}} impossible that shadows on white sand should be blue,--ultramarine,--as they are. I found out, later, that the man had been as far as Brighton beach; but he knew all about Art, confound him. He gave me a lecture on it, and recommended me to go to school to learn technique. I wonder what old Kami would have said to that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But ventre-saint-gris!" [...] ejaculated Lord Walterton, {{who showed}} an {{inclination}} to become quarrelsome in his cups, [...] "we must {{have someone to}} take Endicott's place, <b>I</b> cannot <b>work</b> <b>my</b> system hic ... if so few play...." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was more}} than had ever entered into my {{calculations}} or found room in my hopes. By a brisk appeal to them, it almost seemed that <b>I</b> might <b>work</b> <b>my</b> salvation in this eleventh hour.|$|R
60|$|All of September and October {{was spent}} at the Homestead. Each morning <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> at <b>my</b> writing, and in the {{afternoon}} I drove my mother about the country or wrought some improvement to the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nowhere, so; far as {{the launch}} was concerned. I fell in with a Manilla ship, bound to Valparaiso, and got on board her; and sorry enough was I for the change, when I came {{to find out how}} they lived. The captain took me in, however, and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> passage into port. Finding no ship likely to sail soon, I entered with a native who was about to cross the Andes, bound over on this side, for the east coast. Don't you remember, Miles, monsters of {{mountains}} that we could see, a bit inland, and covered with snow, all along the west side of South America? You must remember the chaps I mean?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{very thought}} that I {{was out in}} a wild storm on a desolate moor filled my soul {{with a sort of}} triumph, and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> {{tricycle}} as if I was spurring my steed to battle. The only thing that troubled me was the thought that if the water that poured off my mackintosh that day could have run into our cistern at home, {{it would have been a}} glorious good thing. Jone did not like the fierce blast and the inspiriting rain, but I knew he'd stand it as long as Mr. Poplington did, and so I was content, although, if we had been overtaken by a covered wagon, I should have trembled for the result.|$|E
60|$|Beyond this {{perspective}} was {{a column of}} steam, and beyond that was where <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> awe-struck way, unwilling to touch beam or wall. The atmosphere was stifling as a night in the rains by reason of the steam and the crowd. I climbed {{to the beginning of}} things and, perched upon a narrow beam, overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in Wisconsin. They had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen. Thence they were flicked persuasively, a few at a time, into a smaller chamber, and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs, so that they rose in the air, suspended from the railway of death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I twisted my foot in some way," [...] she said, [...] "and I do {{not know}} what I am going to do. It hurts me to make a step, and I am sure <b>I</b> cannot <b>work</b> <b>my</b> wheel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> must <b>work</b> <b>my</b> way myself. <b>I</b> {{know that}} very well; I only want a chance to. In consenting to see me, {{after what he}} told you, you almost seem to be giving me a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will help}} you if I can,' said Ian; 'but keep the gold and silver for yourself, and lock me into the smithy to-night, and <b>I</b> will <b>work</b> <b>my</b> spells.' So the man, {{wondering}} to himself, locked him in.|$|R
60|$|Quicker in his leap was Aaron Northrup. I delayed a moment, even as {{the boat}} was shoving away, in order to select a spot {{amidships}} where the men were thickest, so that their bodies might break my fall. I was not minded to embark with a broken member on so hazardous a voyage in the longboat. That the men might have room at the oars, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way quickly aft into the sternsheets. Certainly, I had other and sufficient reasons. It would be more comfortable in the sternsheets than in the narrow bow. And further, it would be well to be near the afterguard in whatever troubles that were sure to arise under such circumstances {{in the days to}} come.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur, I {{assure you}} that at that moment my heart {{absolutely}} stood still. The tempter stood at my elbow and whispered, and I deliberately smothered the call of my conscience. I did what Joseph's brethren did, what brought Judas Iscariot to hopeless remorse. There was {{no doubt that the}} hue and cry was after the two elegantly dressed gentlemen whom I had seen enter the dilapidated house in the Rue Blanche. For a second or two I closed my eyes and deliberately conjured up the vision of Mme. la Marquise fainting for lack of food, and of M. le Vicomte dying for want of sustenance; then <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>my</b> way {{to the door of the}} shop and accosted the burly proprietor with as much boldness as I could muster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Next day I {{began my}} {{experiments}} afresh {{in my new}} quarters. I bolted myself into the laboratory, and set to work with renewed vigour. I was experimenting upon an injured dog, and I placed a large bottle of pausodyne beside me as I administered the drug to his nostrils. The rising fumes seemed to affect my head more than usual in that confined space, and I tottered a little as <b>I</b> <b>worked.</b> <b>My</b> arm grew weaker, and at last fell powerless to my side. As it fell it knocked down the large bottle of pausodyne, and I saw the liquid spreading over the floor. That was almost {{the last thing that}} I knew. I staggered toward the door, but did not reach it; and then I remember nothing more for a considerable period." ...|$|E
60|$|THE BURGLAR [inexorably]. No. <b>I</b> must <b>work</b> <b>my</b> sin off my conscience. This {{has come}} {{as a sort of}} call to me. Let me {{spend the rest of my}} life repenting in a cell. I shall have my reward above.|$|R
6000|$|What feats would <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with <b>my</b> magical hand! [...] Book-learning {{and books}} should be banish'd the land [...] And for hunger and thirst and such {{troublesome}} calls [...] Every ale-house should {{then have a}} feast on its walls.|$|R
