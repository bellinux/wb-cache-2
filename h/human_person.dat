Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
25|$|Many modern Esoteric Christian {{movements}} acknowledge reincarnation {{among their}} beliefs, {{as well as}} a complex energetic structure for the human being (such as etheric body, astral body, mental body and causal body). These movements point out the need of an inner spiritual work which will lead to the renewal of the <b>human</b> <b>person</b> according to the Pauline sense.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: the <b>human</b> <b>person</b> who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E

This capacity can have dramatic consequences for how a person is treated and for that person’s quality of life. In my dissertation, I first propose an original account of what <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> are. I then argue that just as <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> {{have the capacity to}} make artifacts out of material like wood or plastic, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> can also make artifacts out of <b>human</b> <b>persons.</b> I then show how this capacity explains some of the most significant features of <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> by applying my account to gender.

40|$|Some theists {{have adopted}} materialism for <b>human</b> <b>persons.</b> They {{associate}} this metaphysics with {{their belief in}} resurrection and focus on problems arising from personal identity, temporal gaps or material constitution, but, in this paper, I argue that being a materialist for <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> leads to an epistemological problem regarding our knowledge of God’s life. The only way to avoid this problem is to choose a particular materialist metaphysics for <b>human</b> <b>persons,</b> that is, a constitution theory that emphasizes the irreducibility of the first-person perspective...|$|R
25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} {{to make their own}} contribution, {{inspired}} by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which the dignity of the <b>human</b> <b>person,</b> shared responsibility, and love may be living realities. They should firmly commit themselves to oppose every form of exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances.|$|E
25|$|While {{employed}} as {{assistant to the}} professor of the maternity clinic at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847, Semmelweis introduced hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions for interns who had performed autopsies. This immediately reduced the incidence of fatal puerperal fever from about 10% (range 5–30%) to about 1–2%. At the time, diseases were attributed to many different and unrelated causes. Each case was considered unique, just as a <b>human</b> <b>person</b> is unique. Semmelweis's hypothesis, {{that there was only}} one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.|$|E
25|$|The images {{played an}} {{important}} role in debates about abortion and the beginning of human life. Nilsson himself declined to comment on the origins of some of the photographs' subjects, which in fact included many images of terminated and miscarried fetuses: all but one of the images that appeared in Life were of fetuses that had been surgically removed from the womb. Nilsson also refused to be drawn on the question of the point at which life begins, describing himself as a journalist and the debate as one for other authorities. Pro-life campaigners perceived and presented the book's images as evidence that a fetus is a well-developed, discrete <b>human</b> <b>person</b> from well before birth. Pro-choice activists, on the other hand, have portrayed the images (and the technology they represent) as evidence of medical and imaging techniques that now allow serious fetal defects to be detected very early and furnish pregnant parents with more information upon which to base choices. Some critics have described as ironic the image's popularity with pro-life campaigners who argue that the fetus is a living human, given that many of them depict (surgically or spontaneously) aborted fetuses.|$|E

A first {{complaint}} was filed on 4February after a letter from CCMM in which the movement was labelled as a cult, with the following definition: [...] "Groups whose activities have on others for result a notable mental manipulation of minds, a profound degradation of the <b>human</b> <b>person,</b> managing to make people lose all critical sense in locking them in intellectual ghettos." [...] On 16June1993 the Court of Vesoul, and on 24March1994 the [...] Court of Appeal of Besançon, sentenced the church to pay court costs and damages to the CCMM. In a second complaint filed on 27November, the CCMM and the Centre Information Jeunesse in Haute-Saône were sued after distributing a publication critical of the church. Both complaints were dismissed. In 1996, the two appeals for cassation filed {{by the church}} were rejected; the court held that the CCMM's writings did not fall under defamation, said that damages to the church's honor were not proven, that [...] "no reproach can be done when CCMM called 'cult' the Evangelical Church of Pentecost", and that the association [...] "merely assesses the nature and trends of a religious community, reports some of its practices, including those relating to the disease healing and its methods of recruitment through agencies providing relief without indicating that they are the community's emanations".|$|E

500|$|In Part III, Varner {{explores the}} replaceability {{argument}} (the {{idea that it}} would be ethically acceptable to painlessly kill beings if it was immediately replaced with a new equally happy being) in the context of two-level utilitarianism. At the critical level, he argues that both humans and animals are replaceable. However, he argues that the intuitive-level idea that humans are not replaceable should be respected. Animals typically kept on farms are, for Varner, replaceable, meaning that certain forms of animal agriculture are permissible. Varner's also claims that there is a prima facie good in creating more happy animals and more happy humans, the latter meaning that there is a prima facie good in human procreation, and a prima facie wrong in abortion. This, however, applies only to critical-level thinking, and good intuitive-level theorising, he argues, would typically leave these decisions up to individuals. Varner also explores the issue of [...] "marginal" [...] cases. Given that he holds that the lives of nonhuman non-persons and nonhuman near-persons are of lesser value than those of <b>human</b> <b>persons,</b> it may seem that Varner has to accept that the lives of human non-persons and human near-persons are of less value than the lives of <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> or else face the charge of speciesism or inconsistency. However, Varner argues that human non- and near-persons should be given equal rights to life as <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> on the basis that, first, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> have strong relationships with human non-persons, and, second, <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> may fear becoming human non-persons.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its wealth of practical evidence, Causae et Curae is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work {{within the context of}} the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the <b>human</b> <b>person</b> as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach. Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the [...] "green" [...] health of the natural world and the holistic health of the <b>human</b> <b>person.</b> Viriditas, or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person. Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.|$|E

2500|$|This approach, which derives {{its name}} from the Catholic University of Lublin in Poland where it is centered, is also {{sometimes}} called [...] "phenomenological Thomism."

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show that <b>human</b> <b>persons</b> belong, ontologically, in social ontology.

Then I argue that the robust stage of the first-person persective is social, in that it requires a language, and languages require linguistic communities.
