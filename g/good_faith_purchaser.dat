5000|$|A deed that is recorded, {{but is not}} {{connected}} to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated thatBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered {{even though it was}} recorded. [...] "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." [...] A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchasers.</b> Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn.

Among the legal topics we consider are the following: copyright and trademark issues; moral rights which cover the right of an artist to prevent the mutilation and destruction of his work: resale royalties; rules governing ownership disputes between innocent parties such as a <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchaser</b> and an earlier owner of the work of art; disputes over the authenticity of a work of art which cause material changes in the market value of the work; and the valuation of art-rich estates. ...|$|E
40|$|Most Americans in {{the mid-nineteenth}} century lived within a society of laws. There are at least two opposed views with respect to what American attitudes and actions were like outside of such a lawful society. On the one hand, some historians have speculated that {{frontier}} life was lawless and violent. Might entailed right, according to this view. On the other hand, others have suggested that frontier life was natural and good. Americans, freed of the restraints of law, intuitively acted justly. John Phillip Reid here examines countless diaries and letters of American emigrants on the Overland Trail at mid-century. In particular, he examines their attitudes about property and how these attitudes influenced their behavior. He concludes that emigrants on the Overland Trail were neither peculiarly violent nor unusually just. Instead, they were universally lawful. They understood complex concepts of property, and these concepts influenced their behavior. Reid suggests that their understanding of legal ownership and its prerogatives (sometimes exaggerated) was the most important element in influencing their actions with respect to personal property on the trail. Property law, as understood on the trail, was not simplistic. Persons understood the concept of ownership as distinct from mere possession. There was no doubt, for example, that an owner who had lost his property had a legal right to reclaim it. There was no rule of finders-keepers. At most, Reid concludes, a finder could assert a claim for a finder 2 ̆ 7 s fee. The abstract rights of ownership were so potent on the trail that an owner could even reclaim his property from a possessor who had purchased the property in <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> Although Reid does not address the issue, this might have been an exaggeration of the owner 2 ̆ 7 s prerogatives. In several eastern states, the law at that time was beginning to protect some <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchasers.</b> Not only did trail emigrants have no trouble understanding abstract concepts of ownership, they were also conversant with several forms of concurrent ownership. Much property was owned in partnership. This frequently caused divisiveness when equal owners wanted to do different things with the property (e. g., go back home, speed up the journey, abandon the property). Although {{there were a number of}} solutions to these problems, all began with the unalterable premise that each owner had a legal claim to some portion of the property. Co-ownership also caused problems when a particular resource grew scarce. The emigrants normally solved these problems by converting the jointly owned property to privately owned property. Thus, if sugar became scarce, and some owners were using more than their fair share, the emigrants would normally designate each person a private owner of a portion of the sugar. Each could then use his or her sugar at any rate he or she chose. Some may perceive such a solution as an exaggerated reliance on private property concepts...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> {{as one of the}} most controversial concepts in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). While some CISG scholars argue that the role of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is limited to the interpretation of the CISG, others view <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG as a general principle which governs the conduct of the contracting parties. This thesis argues that the nature of the concept, its implicit manifestations in the CISG and the understanding of the transnational case law prove that there are good reasons to consider a broader approach of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG. The thesis tries to explore the concept of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> by critically analysing its connection with other contractual rules, the implication of applying <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contractual agreement and its role in national legal systems and international legal instruments. Following the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> insight, the author explores the vague structure of Article 7 CISG which caused an element of confusion over the role of <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> The authentic texts and the draft history of Article 7 critically analysed to show that a wider application of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG is possible. In addition, the general role of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is enhanced by classifying and elaborating some of the functions of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it is implicitly manifest in the CISG. A list of CISG transnational cases which referred to the concept of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> are critically reviewed to establish that the actual jurisprudence is going to adopt <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as a general principle in the CISG. The conclusion raises important issues related to the need to adopt a general role for <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and methods to improve our understanding of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG...|$|R

40|$|Considering Manhattan’s {{status as}} the leading center of {{international}} art trade, courts in New York are an unsurprising prominent venue for resolving disputes regarding Holocaust related art losses. However, like all art litigation, these disputes have interesting features that render the administration of justice in this field a challenging task. Most notably, the enduring nature of artwork plays {{a central role in}} legal theaters, which all too often turn {{on the question of whether}} the original owner’s restitution claim was timely brought. Therefore, this Article will describe New York’s two-step approach for the assessment of the timeliness of replevin and conversion actions involving stolen cultural property. According to Guggenheim v. Lubell, New York law requires the courts first to apply a “demand and refusal” rule in order to determine the time of accrual for limitation purposes, and, subsequently, to examine the original owner’s diligence in tracing his property under the doctrine of laches. The article’s primary purpose, however, is to call attention to the court’s increasing receptiveness to the limitation and laches defenses in stolen art litigation in general, and Holocaust-related title disputes in particular. Based on a comprehensive survey of all publicly available case law of the past fifteen years on the recovery of stolen art in the New York forum, this Article demonstrates a shift: existing rules are being interpreted to provide significantly more protection for a <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchaser,</b> as opposed to New York’s traditional policy of favoring the original owner. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Good faith purchasers {{for value}} — {{individuals}} who unknowingly {{and in good}} faith purchase property from a seller whose own actions in obtaining the property are of questionable legality — have long obtained special protection under the common law. Despite the seller’s own actions being tainted, such purchasers obtain valid title themselves and are allowed to freely alienate the property without any restriction. Modern copyright law, however, does just the opposite. Individuals who unknowingly and in good faith purchase property embodying an unauthorized copy of a protected work are altogether precluded from subsequently alienating such property, or risk running afoul of copyright’s distribution right. This Article examines copyright law’s anomalous treatment of good faith purchasers and shows how the concerns motivating the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchaser</b> doctrine in the common law, relating to the free alienability of property and the informational burdens that consumers might have to unduly bear, carry over to the principal settings where modern copyright law operates. It then develops an analogous doctrine for copyright law that would balance the concerns of copyright owners and innocent consumers. Under this doctrine good faith purchasers for value of objects embodying infringing content would obtain good title to such objects {{as long as they}} acquire the object from its manufacturer prior to a judicial determination of infringement against the manufacturer, i. e., so long as the manufacturer’s title is merely voidable and not void. The Article illustrates how such a doctrine would work in practice, and shows how its core elements remain compatible with copyright law’s existing analytical structure and normative ideals...|$|E
40|$|This Essay is a {{comparative}} economic {{analysis of the}} disparate doctrines governing the good faith purchase of stolen or misappropriated goods. We argue that prior treatments have misconceived the problem. An owner will take optimal precautions to prevent theft if she is faced {{with the loss of}} her goods; and a purchaser will make an optimal investigation into his seller 2 ̆ 7 s title iffaced with the loss of the goods. An owner and a buyer cannot both be faced with the full loss, however. This presents a problem of 2 ̆ 2 double moral hazard 2 ̆ 2 and it cannot be solved in a first-best efficient way. However, the laws of the major commercial nations are less efficient than they could be. This is particularly true of current U. S. law: In the United States, an owner always can recover stolen goods, which reduces her incentive to take optimal precautions. In turn, a buyer of those goods makes a suboptimal investigation into title because the owner may never find him. We propose that the owner should be permitted to recover goods only if she satisfies a negligence standard set at the socially optimal precaution level (which we argue isfeasible). This would increase her incentive to take precautions while retaining her efficient incentive to search for stolen goods. Since owner search and buyer investigation are complements, our proposal leaves unchanged the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to investigate. Also, under current law, an owner who voluntarily parts with her goods cannot recover them from a <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchaser.</b> This rule reduces the owner 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to search and so reduces the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to investigate. Thus, we propose that a negligence standard should apply to owners generally. We argue that the verifiability objections to a vague standard of negligence can be satisfied by the specification of rulelike proxies for owner negligence. A comparative analysis of the law of good faith purchase in the leading commercial jurisdictions shows the chaotic nature of the current disparity in treatment of owners and buyers. Since today many stolen goods cross national borders, a generally applicable solution to the good faith purchase issue will further reduce the demand for stolen goods, reduce the incidence of strategic litigation, and enhance social welfare...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{international and}} supranational rules on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> {{in the context}} of restitution of cultural property. Deviations from the general rules on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> with regard to the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> acquisition and adverse possession have been indicated. Instead of insuring acquisition of ownership in conjunction with other preconditions, <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> only entitles an acquirer of the stolen or illegally exported cultural object to a fair compensation. The <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> presumption was abandoned and the burden of proof was imposed on the possessor of the cultural object. At the same time the criteria upon which the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> ought to be evaluated had been tightened. Concerning gratuitous legal transactions, <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of a transferee depends on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of a transferor. For that reason, a transferee will be prevented from claiming a fair compensation if {{it would not have been}} awarded to his transferor. Ultimately, the paper explores in which legal sources and in what manner certain EU Member States have implemented <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> stipulations enshrined in Directive 2014 / 60 /EU.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> cannot be defined and {{furthermore}} {{that there is}} no need to define <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it takes on meaning when applied to facts. Hence an explanation or application of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is defined by its function namely to enforce the expected performance of both parties. It is further argued that the function of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> will determine which fact pattern has to be found by a court in order to determine the expected performance of the contractual parties. It follows that <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is the legal concept which allows courts to do justice and do it according to law. As <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> takes on meaning only when applied to contractual terms, Peden is correct to argue that “... the widespread use of ‘good faith’ in legislation is... completely unhelpful in the development of contractual <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> ” An interesting way to juxtaposition this point transnationally is to look at international and US theories of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the light of the development of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in a jurisdiction which has struck a civil law/common law compromise about the use of the concept. Australia presents itself as a fledgling nation in the development of <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> while simultaneously being a CISG state subject to the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of Art. 7. The paper will therefore examine the following: The theoretical base on which a definition or explanation of the function of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is based is very divergent and will be discussed in part one.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide a deeper {{understanding}} of the Scots law of fraud. Adopting a method that is both historical and doctrinal, it provides a critical analysis of the current understanding of fraud and argues for an approach that is more consistent with Scotland’s legal history which, in turn, was profoundly influenced by a much older tradition of European legal thought. It begins by exploring the historical scope of fraud in both a criminal and civil context with specific focus on questions of definition and the extent to which “fraud” was used in the broader sense of activities not involving deceit. A detailed analysis is given of the widespread concept of presumptive fraud by means of which Scots law was able {{to provide a}} remedy for unfair or unwarrantable behaviour without any requirement for a deceitful intention and for misstatements made unintentionally. The argument is made that presumptive fraud was a mechanism for delivering substantive justice and that its conceptual roots lie in an Aristotelian understanding of justice as equality. A comparison is made between the scholastic doctrine of restitution, which was developed by Thomas Aquinas as the outworking of the Aristotelian virtue of justice, and the scheme of Scots law created in the Institutions of the Law of Scotland by Viscount Stair (1619 - 1695), who is said to be the founding father of Scots law. It is suggested that the religious and philosophical conditions which existed in seventeenth century Scotland were particularly fertile soil for scholastic legal ideas which conceptualised law within a moral and religious framework. The second half of the thesis undertakes a doctrinal analysis of fraud in three parts. First, the complex relationship between fraud, error and misrepresentation is examined and the case is made that misrepresentation, whether intentional or unintentional, sits more comfortably in the law of fraud than in the law of error. Secondly, modern legal literature is critically assessed and the dominant modern narrative – that error induced by misrepresentation is a native concept in Scots law – is questioned. Thirdly, a new taxonomy of fraud is proposed which distinguishes between primary and secondary fraud. The operation of secondary fraud (which amounts to “participation” in the primary fraud of another and therefore involves three-party situations) is explored through the application of two familiar legal maxims: the “fraud” principle (that no one should be enriched through the fraud of another) and the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>purchaser</b> for value. In the context of secondary fraud, it is argued that the criteria for its operation - mala fides and a gratuitous transaction - are both core components of the older concept of presumptive fraud. The thesis comes full circle as it is suggested that while the broader equitable definition of fraud, rooted in equality, may have disappeared in the context of primary fraud, secondary fraud retains it...|$|E

The consecration of such an institute in the new Brazilian Civil Procedure Code, which came to be denominated by the doctrine as the procedural <b>good</b> <b>faith’s</b> principle, arise from the demand enlargement of the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the private law and public law.
