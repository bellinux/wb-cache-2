After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of the interior is constructed from recycled materials while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design <b>Gold</b> <b>certificate.</b> He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, John Singer Sargent {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a sculpture by Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
25|$|According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, {{the largest}} note it ever printed was the $100,000 <b>Gold</b> <b>Certificate,</b> Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were {{issued by the}} Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against {{an equal amount of}} gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for {{transactions}} between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.|$|E
25|$|Currently printed {{denominations}} are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Notes {{above the}} $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; {{it was the}} latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. With {{the exception of the}} $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 <b>Gold</b> <b>Certificate</b> and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.|$|E
5000|$|Notes: All Series 1928A <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> were {{consigned}} to destruction and never released; none {{are known to}} exist. All Series 1934 <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> were issued only to banks and were not available to the public. The Series 1934 <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> are also distinguished from the previous <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> in their <b>gold</b> clause, which adds the phrase [...] "as authorized by law" [...] to denote that these notes cannot be legally held by private individuals, and by their distinctive orange reverses. Only a few museum specimens of these Series 1934 <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> survive today. The $100,000 note is the largest denomination currency ever issued by the United States.|$|R
25|$|The first paper bank {{notes were}} <b>gold</b> <b>certificates.</b> They were first issued in the 17th century {{when they were}} used by goldsmiths in England and the Netherlands for {{customers}} who kept deposits of gold bullion in their vault for safe-keeping. Two centuries later, the <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> began being issued in the United States when the US Treasury issued such certificates that could be exchanged for gold. The United States Government first authorized {{the use of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> in 1863. On April 5, 1933 the US Government restricted the private gold ownership in the United States and therefore, the <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> stopped circulating as money (this restriction was reversed on January 1, 1975). Nowadays, <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> are still issued by gold pool programs in Australia and the United States, as well as by banks in Germany, Switzerland and Vietnam.|$|R
25|$|Banks {{may issue}} <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> for <b>gold</b> that is {{allocated}} (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled). Unallocated <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> are {{a form of}} fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of}} a run on the issuing bank's gold on deposit. Allocated <b>gold</b> <b>certificates</b> should be correlated with specific numbered bars, although it is difficult to determine whether a bank is improperly allocating a single bar to more than one party.|$|R
500|$|The {{redesign}} of U.S. banknotes in 1922 prompted the Treasury Department {{to review the}} portraits on banknotes and conclude that [...] "portraits of Presidents of the United States have a more permanent familiarity {{in the minds of}} the public than any others." [...] Exceptions were made for Alexander Hamilton, Salmon Chase, and Benjamin Franklin. There have been no changes in the people depicted on currency intended for the general public since 1928; when Woodrow Wilson was depicted on the 1934 $100,000 <b>gold</b> <b>certificate,</b> the note was only for internal Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank use.|$|E

2500|$|Series 1934 gold {{certificates}} ($100, $1,000, $10,000 [...] and $100,000) {{were issued}} after {{the gold standard}} was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9, 1933 (see United States Executive Order 6102). Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intra-government (i.e., Federal Reserve Bank) transactions and were not issued to the public. This series was discontinued in 1940.
