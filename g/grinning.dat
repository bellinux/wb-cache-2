40|$|International audiencePharmacological, {{genetic and}} {{expression}} studies implicate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia (SCZ). Similarly, several lines of evidence suggest that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) {{could be due}} to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. As part of a project aimed at exploring rare and/or de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders, we have sequenced the seven genes encoding for NMDA receptor subunits (NMDARs) in a large cohort of individuals affected with SCZ or ASD (n= 429 and 428, respectively), parents of these subjects and controls (n= 568). Here, we identified two de novo mutations in patients with sporadic SCZ in <b>GRIN</b> 2 A and one de novo mutation in <b>GRIN</b> 2 B in a patient with ASD. Truncating mutations in <b>GRIN</b> 2 C, <b>GRIN</b> 3 A and <b>GRIN</b> 3 B were identified in both subjects and controls, but no truncating mutations were found in the <b>GRIN</b> 1, <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, <b>GRIN</b> 2 B and <b>GRIN</b> 2 D genes, both in patients and controls, suggesting that these subunits are critical for neurodevelopment. The present results support the hypothesis that rare de novo mutations in <b>GRIN</b> 2 A or <b>GRIN</b> 2 B can be associated with cases of sporadic SCZ or ASD, just as it has recently been described for the related neurodevelopmental disease intellectual disability. The influence of genetic variants appears different, depending on NMDAR subunits. Functional compensation could occur to counteract the loss of one allele in <b>GRIN</b> 2 C and <b>GRIN</b> 3 family genes, whereas <b>GRIN</b> 1, <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, <b>GRIN</b> 2 B and <b>GRIN</b> 2 D appear instrumental to normal brain development and function...|$|R

40|$|The ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs)) {{are composed}} of large complexes of multi-protein subunits creating ion channels in the cell plasma membranes that allow for influx or efflux of mono- or divalent cations (e. g., Ca 2 +) important for synaptic transmissions, cellular migration, and survival. Recently, we discovered the high prevalence of somatic mutations within one of the ionotropic glutamate receptors, <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, in malignant melanoma. Functional characterization of a subset of <b>GRIN</b> 2 A mutants demonstrated a loss of NMDAR complex formation between <b>GRIN</b> 1 and <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and increased migration. Somatic mutation of <b>GRIN</b> 2 A results in a dominant negative effect inhibiting the tumor-suppressive phenotype of wild-type (WT) <b>GRIN</b> 2 A in melanoma. Depletion of endogenous <b>GRIN</b> 2 A in melanoma cells expressing WT <b>GRIN</b> 2 A resulted in increased proliferation compared with control. In contrast, short-hairpin RNA depletion of <b>GRIN</b> 2 A in mutant cell lines slightly reduced proliferation. Our data show that somatic mutation of <b>GRIN</b> 2 A results in increased survival, and we demonstrate the functional importance of <b>GRIN</b> 2 A mutations in melanoma and the significance that ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling has in malignant melanoma...|$|R

40|$|Chronic alcohol {{consumption}} {{may result in}} sustained gene expression alterations in the brain, leading to alcohol abuse or dependence. Because of ethical concerns of using live human brain cells in research, this hypothesis cannot be tested directly in live human brains. In the present study, we used human embryonic stem cell (hESC) -derived cortical neurons as in vitro cellular models to investigate alcohol-induced expression changes of genes involved in alcohol metabolism (ALDH 2), anti-apoptosis (BCL 2 and CCND 2), neurotransmission (NMDA receptor subunit genes: <b>GRIN</b> 1, <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, <b>GRIN</b> 2 B, and <b>GRIN</b> 2 D), calcium channel activity (ITPR 2), or transcriptional repression (JARID 2). hESCs were differentiated into cortical neurons, which were characterized by immunostaining using antibodies against cortical neuron-specific biomarkers. Ethanol-induced gene expression changes were determined by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). After a 7 -day ethanol (50 mM) exposure followed by a 24 -hour ethanol withdrawal treatment, five of the above nine genes (including all four NMDA receptor subunit genes) were highly upregulated (<b>GRIN</b> 1 : 1. 93 -fold, P = 0. 003; <b>GRIN</b> 2 A: 1. 40 -fold, P = 0. 003; <b>GRIN</b> 2 B: 1. 75 -fold, P = 0. 002; <b>GRIN</b> 2 D: 1. 86 -fold, P = 0. 048; BCL 2 : 1. 34 -fold, P = 0. 031), {{and the results of}} <b>GRIN</b> 1, <b>GRIN</b> 2 A, and <b>GRIN</b> 2 B survived multiple comparison correction. Our findings suggest that alcohol responsive genes, particularly NMDA receptor genes, {{play an important role in}} regulating neuronal function and mediating chronic {{alcohol consumption}}-induced neuroadaptations...|$|R
