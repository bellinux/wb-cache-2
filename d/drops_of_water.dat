5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and privations, Halberstam was {{a beacon of}} {{strength}} and hope for his fellow prisoners. When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually washed his hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer {{for hours at a}} time, collecting the <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that dripped from the tank.|$|E
25|$|Outdooring ceremonies {{can vary}} in {{practice}} {{among the different}} Ghanaian ethnic groups. The Ga place <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as kenkey so the child will appreciate a staple food of the Ga. Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E

25|$|Many more pitams are {{preserved}} today {{due to an}} auxin discovered by Dr. Eliezer E. Goldschmidt, emeritus professor of horticulture at the Hebrew University. Working with the picloram hormone in a citrus orchard, he unexpectedly discovered {{that some of the}} Valencia oranges found nearby had preserved perfect pitams. Citrus fruits, other than an etrog or citron hybrid like the bergamot, usually do not preserve their pitam. On the occasions that they do, their pitams tend to be dry, sunken and very fragile. In this case the pitams were all fresh and solid just like those of the Moroccan or Greek citron varieties. Experimenting with picloram in a laboratory, Goldschmidt eventually found the correct “dose” to achieve the desired effect is one droplet of the chemical in three million <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> This invention was highly appreciated by the religious Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|Scientists are {{now turning}} to {{nanotechnology}} {{in an attempt}} to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts. Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.|$|E
500|$|Cyathus stercoreus, {{commonly}} known as the dung-loving bird's nest, is a species of fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. Like other species in the Nidulariaceae, the fruiting bodies of C.stercoreus resemble tiny bird's nests filled with eggs. The fruiting bodies are referred to as splash cups, because they are developed to use the force of falling <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to dislodge and disperse their spores. The species has a worldwide distribution, and prefers growing on dung, or soil containing dung; the specific epithet is derived from the Latin word stercorarius, meaning [...] "of dung".|$|E

500|$|Cyathus striatus, {{commonly}} known as the fluted bird's nest, is a common saprobic bird's nest fungus with a widespread distribution throughout temperate regions of the world. This fungus resembles a miniature bird's nest with numerous tiny [...] "eggs"; the eggs, or peridioles, are actually lens-shaped bodies that contain spores. C.striatus can be distinguished from most other bird's nest fungi by its hairy exterior and grooved (...) inner walls. Although most frequently found growing on dead wood in open forests, it also grows on wood chip mulch in urban areas. The fruiting bodies are encountered from summer until early winter. The color and size of this species can vary somewhat, but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall, and grey or brown in color. Another common name given to C.striatus, splash cups, alludes to the method of spore dispersal: the sides of the cup are angled such that falling <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin stria, meaning [...] "with fine ridges or grooves".|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies {{typically}} grow in clusters, and {{are found}} on dead or decaying wood, or on woody fragments in cow or horse dung. Dung-loving (coprophilous) species include C.stercoreus, C.costatus, C.fimicola, and C.pygmaeus. Some {{species have been}} collected on woody material like dead herbaceous stems, the empty shells or husks of nuts, or on fibrous material like coconut, jute, or hemp fiber woven into matting, sacks or cloth. In nature, fruit bodies are usually found in moist, partly shaded sites, such as the edges of woods on trails, or around lighted openings in forests. They are less frequently found growing in dense vegetation and deep mosses, as these environments would interfere with the dispersal of peridioles by falling <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The appearance of fruit bodies is largely dependent upon features of the immediate growing environment; specifically, optimum conditions of temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are more important factors for fruit rather than the broad geographical {{area in which the}} fungi are located, or the season. Examples of the ability of Cyathus to thrive in somewhat inhospitable environments are provided by C.striatus and C.stercoreus, which can survive the drought and cold of winter in temperate North America, and the species C.helenae, which has been found growing on dead alpine plants at an altitude of [...]|$|E
500|$|Laying {{starts at}} the end of April into early May. The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff, grey or brown {{markings}} at the broad end. The eggs are [...] and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is typically 9–11 eggs, but ranges from 6–13. The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting her warm legs {{into the middle of the}} pile between the eggs. Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg. Second clutches, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest, then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood. The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held. The eggs are maintained at , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day. The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young, and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to her chicks in her bill. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species. There are nonetheless records of an individual surviving to 4years 10months, and even a report of a bird ringed in Winchester in 1989 and found dead in Morocco 7 years 7 months later.|$|E
