40|$|Background We have {{identified}} a kind of parthenocarpy in zucchini squash which is associated with an incomplete andromonoecy, i. e. a partial conversion of female into bisexual flowers. Given that andromonoecy in this and other cucurbit species {{is caused by a}} reduction of ethylene production in the female flower, the associated parthenocarpic development of the fruit suggested the involvement of ethylene in <b>fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development. Results We have compared the production of ethylene as well as the expression of 13 ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes in pollinated and unpollinated ovaries/fruits of two cultivars, one of which is parthenocarpic (Cavili), while the other is non-parthenocarpic (Tosca). In the latter, unpollinated ovaries show an induction of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction pathway genes three days after anthesis, which is concomitant with the initiation of fruit abortion and senescence. <b>Fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development in pollinated flowers of both cultivars and unpollinated flowers of Cavili is coupled with low ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, which would also explain the partial andromonoecy in the parthenocarpic genotype. The reduction of ethylene production in the ovary cosegregates with parthenocarpy and partial andromonoecy in the selfing progeny of Cavili. Moreover, the induction of ethylene in anthesis (by ethephon treatments) reduced the percentage of bisexual parthenocarpic flowers in Cavili, while the inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis or response (by AVG and STS treatments) induces not only andromonoecy but also the parthenocarpic development of the fruit in both cultivars. Conclusions Results demonstrate that a reduction of ethylene production or signalling in the zucchini flower is able to induce <b>fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development, and therefore that ethylene is actively involved in <b>fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development. Auxin and TIBA treatments, inducing <b>fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development in this species, also inhibit ethylene production and the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and response genes. A model is presented that discusses the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin in the control of <b>fruit</b> set and <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development in zucchini squash...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Extensive {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the COBRA gene is critical for biosynthesis of cell wall constituents comprising structural tissues of roots, stalks, leaves and other vegetative organs, however, its role in fruit development and ripening remains largely unknown. Results We identified a tomato gene (SlCOBRA-like) homologous to Arabidopsis COBRA, and determined its role in fleshy fruit biology. The SlCOBRA-like gene is highly expressed in vegetative organs and in <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development, but its expression in fruit declines dramatically during ripening stages, implying a primary role in <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development. Fruit-specific suppression of SlCOBRA-like resulted in impaired cell wall integrity and up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall degradation during <b>early</b> <b>fruit</b> development. In contrast, fruit-specific overexpression of SlCOBRA-like resulted in increased wall thickness of fruit epidermal cells, more collenchymatous cells beneath the epidermis, elevated levels of cellulose and reduced pectin solubilization in the pericarp cells of red ripe fruits. Moreover, transgenic tomato fruits overexpressing SlCOBRA-like exhibited desirable early development phenotypes including enhanced firmness and a prolonged shelf life. Conclusions Our results suggest that SlCOBRA-like {{plays an important role in}} fruit cell wall architecture and provides a potential genetic tool for extending the shelf life of tomato and potentially additional fruits. </p...|$|R

His 1611 series Pastorals using Bloemaert models shows the <b>early</b> <b>fruits</b> of that influence. Their collaboration in various works from 1612 on the theme of Saints and Hermits culminated in 1619 in Antwerp in the Sylva Anachoretica Ægypti Et Palæstinæ (The Hermit Woodland of Egypt and Palestine), a quarto (230mm) volume depicting imaginary portraits of 25 male and 25 female hermits of antiquity, with facing descriptive Latin texts, printed by Hendrick Aertssens. Dutch and French editions were reprinted in the same year. This was apparently commissioned by the Jesuit Heribert van Rosweijde (1569-1629), (founder of the project for the Acta Sanctorum taken up by the Bollandists), rector of the Jesuit college at Antwerp. Rosweyde dedicated the Bolswert work to his benefactor, Abbot Antoine de Wynghe of Liessies Abbey, Département Nord, France.
