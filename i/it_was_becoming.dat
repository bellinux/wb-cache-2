5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly impractical {{to maintain the}} castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> {{clear that}} Mao Zedong's Communists were winning the Chinese Civil War, Xu Lai moved her family from Shanghai to British Hong Kong, while Tang Shengming went to Changsha {{to join the}} {{surrender}} of Hunan Governor Cheng Qian to the Communists. His brother Tang Shengzhi also surrendered. In 1950, Tang Shengming was appointed deputy commander of 21st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army and fought battles against the Kuomintang troops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{case reports}} exist {{from before the}} twentieth century, but were {{influenced}} greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time. By the early twentieth century, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly evident that rumination presented itself {{in a variety of}} ways in response to a variety of conditions. Although still considered a disorder of infancy and cognitive disability at that time, the difference in presentation between infants and adults was well established.|$|E
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> {{clear that}} the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy {{satellite}} mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. His heavy {{drinking}} had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home.

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E

5|$|In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on {{the steam}} yacht Nahlin.

Preparations for all contingencies were made, including {{the prospect of the}} coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the traditional religious location of Westminster Abbey, but in the Banqueting House in Whitehall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now {{sympathetic}} to the Lancastrian cause, but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July the same year, {{it was revealed that}} Warwick's deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> clear that the discontent with Edward's reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> {{clear that}} federal {{intervention}} {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 1936, George V died at Sandringham and Edward {{ascended the}} throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal {{protocol}} {{by watching the}} proclamation of his accession from a window of St James's Palace, {{in the company of}} the still-married Wallis. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> apparent to Court and Government circles that the new King-Emperor meant to marry her. The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the Conservative-led British government, as well as distressing his mother and his brother, the Duke of York. The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} descriptions, {{the body of}} the Lesser Antillean macaw was red and the wings were red, blue and yellow. The tail feathers were between 38 and 51cm (15 and 20 in) long. Apart from the smaller size and the all-red coloration of the tail feathers, it resembled the scarlet macaw and may therefore have been a close relative of that species. The bird ate fruitincluding the poisonous manchineel, was monogamous, nested in trees and laid two eggs once or twice a year. Early writers described it as being abundant in Guadeloupe, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> rare by 1760, and only survived in uninhabited areas. Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterwards. The Lesser Antillean macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. By 1938 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> almost {{impossible}} for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them. After the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region. Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones. The Madagascar Plan, a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out. Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people. Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

Hamence played his final match against Freddie Brown's MCC team on 27 October 1950, scoring 114 in the first innings as South Australia reached 350, and then seven in his final innings before being run out by Bob Berry.
