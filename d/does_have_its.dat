Chess's international governing body is FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs). Most countries {{have a national}} chess organization as well (such as the US Chess Federation and English Chess Federation) {{which in turn is}} a member of FIDE. FIDE {{is a member of the}} International Olympic Committee, but the game of chess has never been part of the Olympic Games; chess <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> own Olympiad, held every two years as a team event.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be used}} in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian {{decision theory}} to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E

AllMusic's James Monger {{gave the}} album a positive review, stating it [...] "feels {{a lot like}} their first three", noting a consistency that [...] "feels like a well-oiled machine." [...] The disc received a negative review from Consequence of Sound's Alex Young, who complained of over-production and the disc's sell-out nature {{at the hands of}} three-time Breaking Benjamin producer David Bendeth: [...] "Dear Agony is the unfortunate side effect of a trend in 'producer' David Bendeth's world, training wild chimpanzees to be more tasteful whilst handling silverware", ultimately giving the record a half-star [...] "for teaching Breaking Benjamin's peers who not to hire for production credit." [...] About Entertainment gave the record a mixed review, feeling that [...] "Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of Phobia, Dear Agony <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> moments," [...] adding, [...] "frustratingly, Dear Agony never reaches greatness, settling for an admirable competency that's still the envy of many of their contemporaries." ...|$|E

500|$|Mongrels {{was given}} mixed reviews, with some {{considering}} its quality to be inconsistent, with a reviewer for tvBite.com {{saying that the}} show was [...] "a bit hit and miss" [...] but also that, [...] "even the laugh-free moments have a well-written sheen." [...] and that the work put into the jokes show. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror wrote: [...] "While {{most of it is}} very funny, some of the gags about Harold Shipman completely misjudge the tone. Maybe the age group BBC3 is aimed at reckon anything is fair game for comedy." [...] The Independents Tom Sutcliffe said that: [...] "It <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> laughs, though, because the script isn't entirely about crass shock value", but that the sitcom, while aimed at adults, is [...] "not really for grown-ups." [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian was mainly positive about Mongrels, but said that the main reason he thought it was funny was because it depicted [...] "cuddly children's toys [...] saying things you wouldn't normally expect cuddly children's toys to say. Like 'You are such a cock-end'", and that, [...] "the novelty will wear off at some point not too far away".|$|E

[...] Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 2 out of 5 with a review stating, [...] "The film <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> moments for sure. Overall, it remains a sweet film — a light and frothy entertainer, but without much substance." [...] Firstpost gave it a rating of 2 out of 5, noting that the film was all about Kapoor and Chopra's [...] "magnetic screen presence" [...] in [...] "the picturesque surroundings they fall in love in. Director Kunal Kohli’s dialogues hit the right notes, but not always. The story goes a tad askew and a bit flat in parts, so as a whole, Teri Meri Kahaani is not the greatest love story ever told on celluloid."

[...] There seems to be some confusion about the colour crimson, as in some cases it is treated as a separate tincture, while in others it is used to specify the shade of gules to be employed by the artist. [...] Differing from most heraldic practice, the Institute of Heraldry often specifies the exact shades to be used in depicting various arms.|$|E

Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff provided 2.5/5, mentioning that [...] "it looks like Harris Jeyaraj has run out of steam.

If a participant follows all the rules, they can complete {{the program and}} have their convictions purged in 30 months. The situation of Charlie McCullough {{should have been a}} complete success story, but it took a detour. McCullough was caught in a police sting buying drugs, and entered drug court voluntarily, determined to kick drugs. Everything went fine for 22 months; he never missed a meeting or appointment and passed all his drug tests. Then at a random urine screening, the lab technician told him he tested positive for methamphetamine. McCullough insisted that he was clean and asked to take another test, which he passed. A third test was administered, which he also passed, so McCullough was relieved. At his next court appearance, Judge Williams asked why he failed a drug test. He was surprised, and stated that he passed the second test. The judge told him she was going to use the first test; the second one didn't count. No matter how much he professed his innocence, the judge didn't believe him. The judge refused to bring in the lab technician to testify, but asked McCullough if he would take a polygraph, which he agreed, then she changed her mind and sentenced him to three days in jail for a [...] "bad" [...] test and 14 days for questioning the results of the drug screening. From that point on, his drug court experience went downhill.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary reviews {{have paid}} {{attention}} to the significance and the value of it in music history. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic defined Whitney Houston as [...] "the foundation of diva-pop" [...] and stated that certainly, the ballads such as [...] "Greatest Love of All" [...] and [...] "Saving All My Love for You", provided [...] "the blueprint for decades of divas". However, he gave higher marks to the lighter tracks like [...] "How Will I Know" [...] and [...] "Thinking About You", commenting these tracks [...] "are what really impresses some 20-plus years on" [...] and [...] "turns the album into a fully rounded record, the rare debut that manages to telegraph every aspect of an artist's career in a mere ten songs." [...] Brad Wete, on a feature article to celebrate for Vibe magazine's 15th anniversary in September 2008, wrote [...] "never before has an African-American woman earned such crossover appeal so early in her career. [...] had an explosive solo debut" [...] and commented [...] "Whitney's prodigious pop set [...] was a fresh serving of precocious talent compared to 1985's mildly flavored R buffet." [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post stated that the album [...] "provided a blueprint for the pop/dance/R careers of Mariah Carey and others, and introduced the world to [...] "The Voice", an octave-spanning, gravity-defying melismatic marvel." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), music journalist J. D.
