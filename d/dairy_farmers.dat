5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. <b>Dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the derease of {{extension}} performance in fulfilling farmer needs is the decrease of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> participation in extension program. The objective of this study was to identify the level of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> participation in extension program in Enrekang Regency. The method used was descriptive analysis by comparing participation level of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> in central area with that in non-central area in terms of planning, implementing and applying the extension program. There were 103 respondents, 57 respondents in central area (55. 13 %) and 46 respondents (44. 87 %) in non-central area, respectively were involved in this study. The data were analysed using t student test with independent group. The result showed that the level of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> participation in extension planning was moderate in the central area which was lower than that in the non central area.

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers,</b> who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E

Prior to 1995, the venue hosted {{trotting}} paceway nights, and was the main pacing venue for the Townsville District, but due to the admittance of the Cowboys, the venue {{was turned into a}} rugby league stadium.

40|$|Development {{status of}} dairy {{industry}} in Sichuan Province, China is analyzed, indicating that how {{to ensure the}} high-quality and ecological production of peasant households has become an important issue for the safety and healthy of the masses {{and the development of}} dairy industry. Game model is established and the solution for the model is obtained. Based on analyzing the relationship of the interests between the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> and the company in ecological agriculture, two mixed strategies of Nash equilibrium are obtained. One is that when the probability is equal to, there are no differences between purchasing or not purchasing; if the probability of company purchase is equal to, there are no differences between producing high-quality milk and poor-quality milk. The other is that if the probability of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> under normal transaction is equal to, there are no differences for the company to select high-quality inspection or low-quality inspection; if the probability of high-quality inspection is equal to, passing off inferior milk as high-grade one has no differences with normal transaction. Therefore, moral risk of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> should be prevented by probability and high-quality inspection. Finally, countermeasures are put forward, such as reducing the risk of transaction, ensuring the basic interest of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> engaged in ecological production, intensifying the supervision, correctly preventing the moral risk of <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer,</b> improving the laws and regulations, and coordinating interests between <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> and company in industrial chain.
