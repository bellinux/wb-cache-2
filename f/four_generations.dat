40|$|Arguments are {{presented}} based on particle phenomenology and {{the requirement for}} Unitarity for a complex valued postulated <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> CKM Matrix (VCKM) based on a Sequential Fourth Generation Model (sometimes named SM 4). A modified <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> QCD Standard Model Lagrangian is utilized per SM 4. A <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> neutrino mass mixing MNS Matrix, (VMNS) is estimated utilizing a Unitary (to Order (Lambda**k), k = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) 4 x 4 Bimaximal Matrix, VBIMAX. The Unitary VBIMAX {{is based on a}} weighted 3 x 3 VBIMAX scheme and is studied in conjunction with the postulated <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> VCKM complex Unitary Matrix. A single parameter has been utilized in our analysis along with three complex DELTA(i,j) phases. A <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> Wolfenstein Parameterization of VCKM is deduced which is valid for order Lambda** 3. Experimental implications of the model are discussed. The issues of Baryogenesis in the context of Leptogenesis associated with MNS Matrix neutrino mixing and Baryogenesis associated with CKM Matrix quark mixing are discussed. These issues are studied {{in the context of the}} postulated complex <b>four</b> <b>generation</b> CKM Matrix and resulting complex MNS Matrix, predicted CP violating parameters, and a Fourth Generation Neutrino mass bound of equal to or greater than 50 GeV.

5|$|The Avars {{initially}} were nomadic horsemen, {{but both}} large cemeteries used by three or <b>four</b> <b>generations</b> {{and a growing}} number of settlements attest to their adoption of a sedentary (non-nomadic) way of life from the 8th century. The Avars' power was destroyed between 791 and 795 by Charlemagne, who occupied Transdanubia and attached it to his empire. Archaeological investigation of early medieval rural settlements at Balatonmagyaród, Nemeskér and other places in Transdanubia demonstrate that their main features did not change with the fall of the Avar Khaganate. New settlements appeared in the former borderlands with cemeteries characterized by objects with clear analogues in contemporary Bavaria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moravia and other faraway territories. A manor defended by timber walls (similar to noble courts of other parts of the Carolingian Empire) was unearthed at Zalaszabar.|$|E
5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be {{registered}} as a Limousin in the respective country's herd book. In the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a graded up Limousin, after three generations for females and <b>four</b> <b>generations</b> for males, is known (confusingly {{with the legal}} European definition) as purebred, which is then eligible for recording in the respective countries' herd books alongside Fullblood and French Pure Limousins. Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} grading up, in Britain grading up can only occur using Full French bulls. British graded up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be registered as Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register. The British Limousin Pedigree Register is separate from the British Limousin Herd Book, which is reserved for animals that have complete Full French ancestry.|$|E

5|$|By far, {{the most}} {{important}} source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as Sangam literature, generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era. It consists of 2,381 known poems, {{with a total of}} over 50,000 lines, written by 473 poets. Each poem belongs to one of two types: Akam (inside) and Puram (outside). The akam poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the puram poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The Maduraikkanci by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III. The Netunalvatai by Nakkirar contains a description of the king’s palace. The Purananuru and Akanaṉūṟu collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology Pathirruppaththu provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or <b>four</b> <b>generations</b> of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in Ainkurnuru, written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai.The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as Akanaṉūṟu, Kuruntokai, Natṟiṇai and Purananuru. The Pattinappaalai describes the Chola port city of Kaveripumpattinam in great detail. It mentions Eelattu-unavu – food from Eelam – arriving at the port. One of the prominent Sangam Tamil poets is known as Eelattu Poothanthevanar meaning Poothan-thevan (proper name) hailing from Eelam mentioned in Akanaṉūṟu: 88, 231, 307; Kurunthokai: 189, 360, 343 and Naṟṟiṇai: 88, 366.|$|E
