40|$|European <b>hake</b> (EH), <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius,</b> is a {{demersal}} fish distributed from the North Sea and Atlantic to the Levantine Sea in the Mediterranean. EH {{is an important}} predator of deep Mediterranean upper shelf slope communities and it is currently characterised by growth overexploitation. EH adults feed mainly on fish and squids whereas the young (< 16 cm) feed on crustaceans. All current EH diet studies relied on the morphological identification of prey remains in stomach content, however this method is labour intensive and it precludes the identification of strongly digested food. The development of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) approaches provide more accurate methods for dietary studies revealing many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). The {{aim of this study}} is to use a HTS approach based on COI amplification, contextually to classic microscopic morphological identification, to analyse EH stomach content and to evaluate the efficiency of the molecular method. HTS sequencing has been carried out on the amplicons obtained by PCR amplification (Leray et al. 2013) of stomach remains and all the Miseq Illumina paired-end reads have been analysed by using bioinformatic tools (Boyer et al. 2015) for taxonomic assignment. The selected sequences clustered in OCTUs (Operational Clustered Taxonomic Units) and taxonomically assigned, will be used in diversity analyses to compute distance matrices among samples, to compare taxa summaries from different samples, to create networks and perform PCA and PcoA analysis. Classic microscopic morphological analyses on stomach content remains have been carried out contextually to compare the results of the two methods.

40|$|The {{fishing grounds}} of the Patagonian Shelf support {{some of the most}} {{important}} fisheries in the world. The great abundance of marine resources among parallels 35 º and 54 º South, is associated with the Subtropical Convergence formed by the Brazil and Falkland/Malvinas currents. The mixing of the flow of La Plata River and the western branch of the Falkland/Malvinas Current generates areas of high plankton production on the shelf. <b>Hakes</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> hubbsi and <b>Merluccius</b> australis) and cephalopods (Illex argentinus and Loligo gahi) have been found the main commercial species, with important amounts of accompanying species in the catches such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), Kingclip (Genypterus blacodes), Hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), Red cod (Salilota australis), Southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), etc. These fisheries are currently among the most important to the Spanish bottom trawler freezing fleet that has around 40 vessels fishing in this area, besides another 20 that operate in joint ventures sailing Falkland flag.

40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in european <b>hakes</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius)</b> belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius</b> captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from FAO area 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The blue ling (Molva dypterygia), european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|R

40|$|Fish muscle {{proteins}} undergo complex physicochemical {{changes during}} frozen storage which {{result in the}} toughening of muscle and unpalatability. The aim of this thesis {{was to examine the}} aggregation of fish proteins as a result of frozen storage, in particular the effect of formaldehyde on proteins. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Namibian <b>hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus) muscle proteins were characterised and differentiated by electrophoretic and immunological approaches. The nature of the chemical bonds involved was elucidated by the use of reagents capable of breaking the non-covalent and covalent bonds. Conformational changes of the protein were investigated by both immunological and chemical techniques. Structural and textural changes on frozen storage in the presence of formaldehyde were examined by microscopic, deformation-compression analysis and dynamic mechanical testing. In addition, a lysosomal enzyme (Trimethylamine oxidase) which is responsible for the toughening of gadoid fish muscle during storage was characterised. Electrophoretic separation of the sarcoplasmic proteins from <b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus confirmed the biological closeness of the two species. A 19 kD protein band from M. capensis, excised from the SDS gel, was used for the production of polyclonal antibodies as analysed by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Formaldehyde and frozen storage augmented the extent of protein insolubilisation. The results of this study showed conclusively that formaldehyde {{is only one of many}} factors involved in the denaturation of fish proteins during frozen storage. List of objectives of the project.

40|$|From 1992 to 2001, {{by-catch}} {{that was}} landed from the Spanish deepwater trawl fishery for black hake off Mauritania was closely monitored. This {{is a highly}} specialised fishery, with two species of black <b>hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> senegalensis and <b>Merluccius</b> polli) constituting between 77 – 99 % of total land-ings, which have annually averaged 9 300 tons {{over the past two}} decades. Landings of Sparidae were highest among by-catch species of commercial value, with the large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthal-mus being the most important until 1996, after which the family Lophiidae and others predominated. Next were the Elasmobranchii, including large demersal squalids and several species of rays, although their annual landings fell from 182 tons in 1992 to only 4 tons in 1999, rising to 37 tons in 2001. The present paper analyses these changes using by-catches retained in the black hake fishery. We believe that the decline could be due to a set of different factors: a change in depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both targeted species and by-catch. Elasmobranchs constituted only 0. 1 % of total landings in 1999, compared to 1. 9 % in 1992, although their contribution to total com-mercial by-catch was constant. Seasonality was clearly evident, with an absolute and proportional rise in elasmobranch by-catch during warm periods, reaching 75 % of by-catch landings in some months, coinciding with a drop in total by-catch. These seasonal variations could be related to the migratory habits of the fishery's target species, black hake...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 1984. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The chief {{sector of}} the South African fishing industry, {{demersal}} trawling {{is in a state}} of uncertainty that brings its competitiveness and long term developnent into question. The <b>Hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus) resource, which accounts for 70 % of the landed catch, has finally started on the expected road to recovery and it is anticipated that this will proceed shortly for a nunber of years. During 1983 comfort was derived from the resulting rise in catch per unit effort rates and a significant improvement in the average size of fish landed. This, together with lower fuel prices and increased operating efficiences, enable the industry to operate at lower expenditure. Unfortunately, a second successive reflection of the T. A. C. (Total Allowable Catch) of 12 % in 1983 meant that gains in productivity were not fully reflected in reduced landed costs. This year (1984) the T. A. C. was increased by 4, 8 % which only marginally improves the already poor situation. More serious difficulties can be traced to adverse market developments. The price of fish has fallen in real terms (see Table 1. 1 below) over a number of years. However, in 1983, the industry experienced a startling fall in prices, the severity of which may be gauged from the fact that actual prices realised were roughly equal to those of 1981. (Bross, 8 May, 1984) This pattern is continuing through 1984 - as is seen in Table 1. 1, an extract from Irvin & Johnson financial results...|$|R
