It is very popular with children who celebrate Diwali because of the excitement of bursting firecrackers. Special shops to sell firecrackers are set up in all towns, cities and bigger villages. Some areas host local stage story telling called Hari Katha. Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fireworks. This will be burst by a person dressed as Lord Krishna or, more accurately, a costume of Satyabhama, the consort of Lord Krishna, who actually killed the demon Narakasura; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Orion, {{it is in}} the period November–January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere) when Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the South. In the Northern Hemisphere's spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, at those times and places in the Arctic when midnight sun obscures the stars. In countries close to the equator Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October <b>evening</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Takashi Hasegawa, who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia; Koki Matsumoto, who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia; Hideo Baba, who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth; and Takaaki Okuda, a newcomer to the series. The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star shining on the land, similar to Venus in the <b>evening</b> <b>sky.</b> The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and {{to have a sense of}} justice that did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs. One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other. A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede, who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura.|$|E

2500|$|In {{philosophy}} and certain models of psychology, qualia ( [...] or singular form: quale) are {{claimed to be}} individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.

2500|$|The name [...] "planet" [...] {{comes from}} the Greek term [...] (planētēs), meaning [...] "wanderer", as ancient astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in {{relation}} to the other stars. Five planets can be seen with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the Greek names being Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Zeus and Cronus. Sometimes the luminaries, the Sun and Moon, are added to the list of naked eye planets to make a total of seven. Since the planets disappear from time to time when they approach the Sun, careful attention is required to identify all five. Observations of Venus are not straightforward. Early Greeks thought that the evening and morning appearances of Venus represented two different objects, calling it Hesperus ("evening star") when it appeared in the western <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> and Phosphorus ("light-bringer") when it appeared in the eastern morning sky. They eventually came to recognize that both objects were the same planet. Pythagoras is given credit for this realization.|$|E

2500|$|In lines 9-12, {{the poet}} {{attempts}} {{to quell the}} torment of day and night by using flattery. In line 9, when the poet writes [...] "when I tell the day, to please him thou art bright", 'him' {{is indicative of the}} day while 'thou' is the beloved.

[...] Furthermore, when the <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> appears grim and starless, the poet uses flattery by telling him that evening is [...] "gilded by the beloved." [...] In lines 11 and 12, the word [...] "'night', not 'evening', is required by logic, but 'even' is imposed by rhyme" [...] – a proclamation that [...] "the evening star is the brightest star in the sky." [...] Furthermore, the poet again attempts to appease his torturers in line 11 by referring to night as 'swart-complexioned'. The poet's adulation is counterfeit, as he knows that a starless night is unattractive, but this admission enables Shakespeare to [...] "insert into the poem a flash of praise of the beloved, whose brightness graces a dull day and gilds a dull evening." ...|$|E
