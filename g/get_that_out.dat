I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life.

500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly {{involved}} pop influenced R. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' {{is a great way to}} start the record, because it is emotional and it kind of speaks directly to the questions people might have about the last year of her life. It's a good idea to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of the way and move on to happy, less emotional songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The news {{asserted}} that both tour plans with Blink-182 in August 2009 and new album production [...] "will continue as previously announced," [...] and the announcement {{ended with the}} teaser for a [...] "surprise" [...] soon to come. The following day, Alternative Press broke the news that [...] "New Perspective", the first song recorded without Ross and Walker, debuted the following month on radio and {{as a part of}} the soundtrack to the film Jennifer's Body. [...] "New Perspective" [...] was recorded in spring 2009, when the band had just moved out to Topanga. Smith explained the song was inspired by the band's new experiences when there: [...] "We're living near the ocean and going surfing every day, which we've never done before. We tried to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> in the song, I guess." [...] The band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of Ross and Walker.|$|E
2500|$|MG Siegler of TechCrunch {{said that}} the {{difference}} between Lion and Mountain Lion was not comparable to the difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard because Mountain Lion adds many new features that were not available in Lion. He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when Mountain Lion hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, what {{you really want to know}} is whether Mountain Lion is worth the upgrade. Let's <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of the way now — yes, it is definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, Mountain Lion was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|E

That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{pressure}} of matching [...] "Call Me Maybe"'s success, Jepsen recorded an entire indie-folk album during her run on Cinderella {{as an act of}} [...] "rebellion". The effort was scrapped as Jepsen felt like it was developed for the wrong reasons: [...] "I think there is a natural rebellion when you have success in one area to completely rebel against that. I needed to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of my system, I think. I made really weird music." [...] Her work on the musical provided valuable perspective in terms of being defined by a singular song, particularly from her costar Fran Drescher: [...] "Everyone still calls her 'the Nanny'. I realized you can't give in to other people's perception of you. Everyone's gonna be known for something."" [...] had to not be about trying to prove something. I feel like if you're writing music just to have a different identity in the public's eye, it's sort of the wrong motive. It's gotta be coming from a place of what you love and what you're passionate about."Jepsen sketched many of the album's demos on her tour bus while supporting Kiss, completing three by June 2013. Of these, [...] "Boy Problems" [...] would eventually finalize its form with Sia and Greg Kurstin. [...] "I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance" [...] existed as early as 2011 according to matching lyrics on a tweet authored by Jepsen. It would eventually be presented to Max Martin after the pair finished work on [...] "Tonight I'm Getting Over You" [...] in 2012; intending to cease their session at midnight, the song compelled Martin to stay for two extra hours. It was confirmed that she had worked with Josh Ramsay, Ryan Stewart, Benny Blanco and Stargate, though none of these producers appeared on the finalized project.|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
