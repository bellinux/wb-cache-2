40|$|Abstract Housing First is an {{effective}} intervention that ends and prevents homelessness for individuals with severe mental illness and co-occurring addictions. By providing permanent, independent housing without prerequisites for sobriety and treatment, and by offering support services through consumer-driven Assertive Community Treatment teams, Housing First removes {{some of the major}} obstacles to obtaining and maintaining housing for consumers who are chronically homeless. In this study, consumers diagnosed with severe mental illness and who had the longest histories of shelter use in a suburban county were randomly assigned to either one of two Housing First programs or to a treatment-as-usual control group. Participants assigned to Housing First were placed in permanent housing at higher rates than the treatment-as-usual group and, over the course of four years, the majority of con-sumers placed by both Housing First agencies were able to maintain permanent, independent housing. Results also highlight that providers new to Housing First must be aware of ways in which their practices may deviate from the essential features of Housing First, particularly with respect to enrolling <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers</b> on a first-come, first-served basis and separating clinical issues from tenant or housing responsibilities. Finally, other aspects of successfully implementing a Housing First program are discussed...|$|R

Data collection occurred before the introduction of CDC and included face-to-face, in-depth interviews, summaries of interviews, field notes and reflective journaling. Semi-structured questions and 'emotional touchpoints' relating to home care were used to guide the interview conversation. Line-by-line data analysis, where significant statements were highlighted and clustered to reveal emergent themes, was used. Five older people, aged 81 to 91 years, participated in the study. The four emergent themes were: seeking quality and reciprocity in carer relationships; patchworking services; the waiting game; and technology with utility.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the INFORUM group at the University of Maryland {{has been working with}} the Office of the Actuary in the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop a model to address various aspects of health care policy. We began with the INFORUM LIFT model, a macro-interindustry model, {{predecessors}} of which have been used since the late 1960 s. A key question we set out to answer was: 2 how much health care can we afford? It's not clear that we will ever answer that question. But, like all really interesting questions, attempts to find answers led to more questions and more work on the model. For example, to improve our view of the health care sector as a whole, we separated our single health care sector into nursing homes, physicians, hospitals, and other. We expanded the detail of the labor compensation package to include information on employer contributions for health insurance (as well as pensions and all other non-wage contributions). Janoska (1996) improved the modeling of the Medicare program by treating it as a subsidy for medical care (which reduces the price facing <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers)</b> rather than an income transfer (providing consumers with the income to purchase care or providing care directly). This work was incorporated in a crucial part of the model, the consumer spending equations, the general consumer demand system where relative prices across goods partially determine spending. Finally, we lengthened the simulation horizon from 2010 to 2050 an...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Home Medicines Review (HMR) Program, {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the number of medication-related problems and hospital admissions, has not been used to the extent projected and is little known among <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers.</b> PURPOSE: This paper investigates the problems patients and caregivers have with using medicines appropriately, their desire for assistance with managing medications and their self-perceived need for a Home Medicines Review. DESIGN: A qualitative research study was conducted with 8 semi-structured focus groups including a total of 50 HMR-eligible patients and caregivers. Participants who were purposively sampled represented older males, older females, younger chronically ill patients, patients from Chinese and Arabic backgrounds and the general HMR target group. FINDINGS: According to the types of medicine problems encountered by participants, their level of medicine understanding and their desire for assistance with using medicines, four distinct patient types are identified and explicated: the heedless patient, the aware patient, the scrupulous patient and the self-sufficient patient. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The uptake of the HMR service can be effectively increased by direct-to-consumer HMR promotion that is tailored to the behaviors, needs and desires of eligible patients and caregivers. The proposed segmentation model of HMR-eligible consumers addresses these differences and can be used to inform health policy makers regarding a more effective promotion of the HMR service. ORIGINALITY: This is the first study to investigate how the HMR-uptake could be increased from the perspective of eligible patients and their caregivers...|$|R
40|$|We {{start by}} {{assuming}} {{that a major}} benefit of many new durable products such as dishwashers and microwave ovens is time savings. Others, such as VCRs, also enhance the value of our leisure time. Using a household production framework we demonstrate that a utility maximizing individual will have a reservation price for the product which {{is a function of}} the product benefits and his wage rate. By assuming that the wage rate has an extreme value distribution across the population, we are able to derive, for the aggregate process, an income-price dependent logistic adoption equation. We then allow for the possibility that certain <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers</b> may delay their purchase of the product because they are unaware that it exists, are suspicious of its quality, or expect its price to fall. Unawareness, uncertainty and hope for further price declines are assumed to decrease with the increase in the number of previous adopters. The resulting diffusion model has the property that the product life cycle phenomenon can be explained jointly or separately by the income-price process, and the awareness-uncertainty-expectations process. Using data on household income, on durable penetration within different income classes, and on first-purchase sales the aggregate diffusion model and its premises are tested and supported. It is found that both the income-price and awareness-uncertainty-expectations processes are at work. However, the dependence of the awareness-uncertainty-expectations delay process on the number of previous adopters (e. g., word-of-mouth type effect) exists only in certain product categories and is usually relatively weak. It is demonstrated that if the word-of-mouth type effects are weak, a price skimming strategy is optimal for a monopolist and also is likely to be implemented by oligopolists. The sales forecasting implications of the model also are pursued. durable products, diffusion of innovations, life cycle pricing...|$|R

40|$|People {{who live}} in poverty and are unable to work because of serious mental or {{physical}} illness are eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). With SSI eligibility, consumers are enrolled in Medicaid and Food Stamp prgrams. Thus, {{it is crucial that}} mental health programs help consumers to apply for these benefits. In 1994, Institute faculty published the results of a controlled study in Community Mental Health Journal, which showed that a brief intervention could significantly increase the rates of applications and awards for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses. Now, ten years later, administrative data from the FMHI Policy and Services Research Data Center (PSRDC) and mortality data from the Social Security Death Index were examined to gain insights into the longitudinal history of these individuals. It is possible for case managers to complete a simple form that predicts SSI allowance over an 8 to 12 year period. Thus, mental health programs who work with severely and persistently impaired individuals should engage in SSI outreach activities and assist this vulnerable population to secure benefits. This study also shows the persistent nature of severe mental illness. Researchers were able to account for over one-half {{of the people in the}} original study during the ten-year follow-up period. At the follow-up period, about one-half of the possibly <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers</b> who were not on SSI in 1991 were on SSI 8 to 12 years later. Moreover, the rate of death, Baker Act placement, and/or state hospital placement was quite high. This suggests that the populations served by these three community mental health centers were largely experiencing severe and persistent mental illness that still required treatment many years later. Further, these results suggest that the aging of the “baby boomer” generation will cause a significant increase in the number of people on SSI. Finally, consistent with the results of the original study, it is clear that applied mental health treatment programs should establish structured programs to help disabled individuals to apply for SSI in addition to normal case management activities. The study suggests that formal intervention with trained linkage workers, knowledgeable about this complex program, is beneficial.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{definition}} of consumer in Fiji should be broadened to include the micro and small enterprises (MSEs). A {{survey conducted by the}} National Centre for Small and Micro Enterprises Development in Fiji provides a deep insight into the operation of MSEs in Fiji. The survey findings reveal that MSEs are vulnerable and could be easily exploited by larger companies in the market. One {{of the ways in which}} MSEs could be protected is by providing them with the consumer-level protection. This paper argues that MSEs are <b>eligible</b> for <b>consumer</b> protection because like consumers, they also have poor bargaining power, less expertise in making an informed purchasing decision and significant difficulties in seeking remedies against the large suppliers. The paper further contends that the definition of consumer must not only be widened in the general consumer protection law but in the consumer credit legislation and with respect to unfair contract terms too. The arguments against the proposal to broaden the definition are that all businesses, regardless of their size, should be treated the same, there are other relevant laws for the protection of business-consumers and that it would put extra burden on the suppliers, many of whom are small businesses themselves. The paper ends with a draft definition of consumer which includes domestic consumers, micro businesses, whether purchasing for business use or re-sale and small businesses purchasing for business consumption...|$|R

40|$|Consumer boycotts are a {{worldwide}} and historic phenomenon in modern society. As {{the number of}} protests grows and as local authorities recognize {{the economic and political}} impact of such activities, then multinational corporations (MNCs) and host countries begin to see the historic and cultural perspective of these events besides the conventional consumer behavior perspective. They may also be regarded as crisis handling issues in public relations which have a considerable and far-reaching economic impact on these MNCs and their home countries (Petra and Adamantios 2007). To enable boycotting to become less harmful, the MNCs 2 ̆ 7 management needs to understand what makes local consumers so affronted. This study first examines the relationships among six constructs: consumer animosity, efficacy, ethnocentrism (CETSCALE), prior purchase, product judgment, and boycott participation, in a boycotting issue context. The study then examines the role of occupancy status in an integrated boycott model, which embraces the above six measurement models. The theories of consumer animosity and the five other models have been adopted to explain Chinese consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to boycott against Japanese products or services with the fallout from Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 2 ̆ 7 s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine since he came into power in 2001. The six constructs provide the basis for introducing an integrated model which is hypothesized and examined in this study by means of the structural equation modeling (SEM) statistical technique. Consumer animosity attributes are {{based on the work of}} Klein, Ettenson, and Jung et al. (Klein, Ettenson et al. 1998; Ang, Jung et al. 2004; Ettenson and Klein 2005); ethnocentrism and product judgment constructs are adapted from the work of Klein, Ettenson, Krishnan, and Shankarmahesh (Klein, Ettenson et al. 2006; Shankarmahesh 2006); efficacy attributes are derived from the research of Ettenson and Klein (2005). Two other constructs, prior purchase and boycott participation, and their corresponding indices are measured by means of expert validation. The status of occupancy is determined by a real-life incidence of military occupation imposed on China by Japan in 19402 ̆ 7 s. In order to collect the data needed for this study, a self-administrated questionnaire was developed. English and Chinese language versions of the questionnaire were prepared. A systematic sample of <b>eligible</b> <b>consumers</b> was obtained with the help of stratified sampling technology, and data were collected through mail surveys by questionnaire for two phases (including pilot study) in five months. Data were analyzed in six stages: preliminary analyses (i. e., demographic and descriptive statistics), reliability test, construct validity, measurement model fit, structural model fit, and multiple-group invariance analysis. In total twelve major hypotheses are examined in the study, with the first six of these concerning the factor relationships among the six constructs. The proposed hypotheses suggest that there are significant and positive pairwise relationships between boycott participation and the other three factors (i. e., consumer animosity, consumer efficacy and prior purchase). The statistically significant and positive relationships observed suggest that high animosity towards Japanese goods embedded amongst Chinese consumers, and the other two constructs (efficacy and prior purchase behaviour) at the high end of attitude spectrum respectively increase the level of willingness to engage in consumer boycott practices. At the same time, consumer ethnocentrism and product judgment towards Japanese goods contribute significantly to Chinese consumer behaviour regarding past purchases of Japanese products or services. The remaining six hypotheses deal with invariance tests on structural equation mode ling between the two groups of the sample: occupied area vs. free area. The results suggest that, regardless of the status of occupancy condition (occupied vs. free), the tendencies of animosity, efficacy and prior purchase behaviour play important roles in attitudes towards, and participation in, boycott activities. In addition, the outcomes of the data analyses testify to the indirect influence of both consumer ethnocentrism and product judgment on consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to participate in boycott activity. The findings of this study offer pivotal implications for decision-makers and other managements of those western multinational enterprises who are concerned with increasing their share of the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest consumer market. In particular, Japanese MNCs need to pay much more attention to the oppressed and potentially explosive emotion of animosity as the legacy of past conflicts (i. e., war, economic, political etc.) between Japan and China in modern history, regardless of a difference on the status of past Japanese occupation. The results of this evaluation can potentially be generalized towards a strategic analysis of the boycott model in other hostile market situations...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{transparency}} criteria {{adopted by}} the European Medicines Agency require <b>eligible</b> patient and <b>consumer</b> organisations to disclose the names and contributions of their public and private revenue sources. Despite various transparency initiatives, the exact funding sources of, and amounts received by, eligible organisations remain unclear. This article examines how many patient and <b>consumer</b> organisations <b>eligible</b> {{to work with the}} Agency (n= 23) received corporate sponsorship between 2006 and 2008 and how much. The article also reports how many organisations met the Agency‟s criteria on financial disclosure. Methods: Financial data were retrieved from organisations‟ and pharmaceutical companies‟ websites in January and February 2010, as well as through direct requests for the information placed in March 2010. A method for estimating sponsorship in the absence of reported contributions was developed and applied uniformly. Results: Fifteen of the twenty-three eligible organisations received financial sponsorship from corporate sources whilst seven received funding entirely from other sources. We failed to retrieve any financial data or revenue sources for one of the 23 organisations. The annual average corporate contribution per sponsored organisation rose from € 185, 500 in 2006, to € 282, 090 in 2007, to € 321, 230 in 2008. These amounts correspond to 47 %, 51 % and 57 % of organisational average annual revenue, respectively. Fewer than half of the 23 organisations met the Agency‟s financial reporting guidelines. Conclusions: This study indicates low compliance with the guidelines which EMA introduced in 2005 to ensure the financial transparency of the organisations working with it. Levels of corporate sponsorship differ greatly between those organisations that receive no financial support and others who rely upon it heavily. The lack of a uniform and detailed reporting system hinders complete public disclosure of the nature, and extent of, corporate sponsorship of these organisations. This study focuses on the issue of corporate sponsorship of patient and consumer organisations active at the EMA. However, these organisations represent only a selection of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other stakeholders active in the area of health and pharmaceutical policy in Europe. Thus, further research is called for on financial transparency, and the nature of corporate sponsorship and conflicts of interests of civil society representatives in European health policy making...|$|R
