5|$|An {{upper body}} injury forced Tanguay {{out of the}} Flames' line-up for 15 games in 2011–12. The team never {{identified}} the injury, which was speculated to be a concussion. He still finished third <b>in</b> <b>team</b> scoring, with 49 points in 64 games. Tanguay again finished third <b>in</b> <b>team</b> scoring in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, scoring 27 points in 40 games. On February 2, 2013, in a 3–2 shoot-out defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks, Tanguay registered his 500th career assist on a Dennis Wideman goal. His season was again impacted by injury, as he missed the Flames' final games of the campaign after suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament {{in a game against}} the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{left the}} Golden Gophers seventh all-time among team defensemen with 33 goals. He {{was also the}} 74th player <b>in</b> <b>team</b> history to notch 100 points, which also ranked him 11th among defensemen.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} chapter {{is to examine the}} emergence, consequences, and {{management}} of errors <b>in</b> <b>teams.</b> We begin by discussing the origin and emergence of errors <b>in</b> <b>teams.</b> We argue that errors <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> can originate at both the individual and collective level and suggest this distinction is important because it has implications for how errors propagate within a team. We then consider the paradoxical effects of errors on team performance and team learning. This discussion highlights the importance of error management <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> so that errors can prompt learning {{while at the same time}} mitigating their negative consequences. Thus, we focus significant attention on the challenge of error prevention and error management <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> and highlight numerous factors that can influence these processes. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of important research gaps and outline an agenda for future work in this area...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} reveals how {{leadership}} effectiveness <b>in</b> project <b>teams</b> {{is dependent on}} the level of organizational tenure diversity. Data from 34 project teams showed that transformational leadership is related to organizational commitment, creative behavior, and job satisfaction, but only <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> with high organizational tenure diversity. By contrast, participative leadership has no impact on team innovativeness, team performance, and <b>team</b> conflict <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> with high organizational tenure diversity, yet is beneficial with respect to the same outcomes <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> that are low in organizational tenure diversity. Theoretical and practical implications for leading project teams and future research in this area are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interesting}} area {{of research}} is the decreased susceptibility to change blindness when individuals are placed <b>in</b> <b>teams.</b> Although change blindness is still observed within teams, {{research has indicated that}} changes between images are noticed more when individuals work <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> as opposed to individually. [...] Both teamwork and communication assist <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> correctly identifying changes between images.|$|R

The Yankees are currently overseen by Hal Steinbrenner, who owns the team in conjunction with his brother Hank Steinbrenner, and GM Brian Cashman.|$|E

40|$|Most {{professional}} development activities focus on individual teachers, such as mentoring {{or the use}} of portfolios. However, new developments in higher education require teachers to work together <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> more often. Due to these changes, there is a growing need for {{professional development}} activities focusing on teams. Therefore, this review study was conducted to provide an overview of what is known about professional development <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> the context of higher education. A total of 18 articles were reviewed that describe the effects of professional development <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> on teacher attitudes and teacher learning. Furthermore, several factors that can either hinder or support professional development <b>in</b> <b>teams</b> are identified at the individual teacher level, at the team level, and also at the organizational level...|$|R

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} were hung above {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} in the ring, with only the legal men allowed to use them. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot <b>in</b> <b>Team</b> Canada, which Cage said he would consider.|$|E
5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought <b>in</b> <b>team</b> history.|$|E
5|$|After the team's largest {{victory of}} the season (22–1 over the Cincinnati Reds) in early July, five Phillies—Howard, Ibáñez, second baseman Chase Utley, and outfielders Shane Victorino and Jayson Werth—were {{selected}} to the All-Star team. July was the team's best showing of the season, as they compiled their first 20-win month since the 2001 season. The Phillies traded for starting pitcher Cliff Lee {{at the end of}} the month to bolster their starting rotation, who won his first five starts with the team, and signed free-agent pitcher Pedro Martínez. In August, Eric Bruntlett turned the first game-ending unassisted triple play in National League history, and the second <b>in</b> <b>team</b> history. The following month, the team clinched its third consecutive division championship on September 30, becoming the first Phillies team to make a third straight playoff appearance since the 1976–1978 Phillies.|$|E

5|$|As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' {{rivalry with}} the Boston Red Sox {{increased}} in intensity as the sides met multiple {{times in the}} American League Championship Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004.
