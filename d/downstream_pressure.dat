The gas may be supplied from a scuba cylinder carried by the diver or via a hose from a compressor or high pressure storage cylinders at the surface in surface-supplied diving. A gas pressure regulator has one or more valves in series which reduce pressure from the source, and use the <b>downstream</b> <b>pressure</b> as feedback to control the rate of flow and thereby the delivered pressure, lowering the pressure at each stage.|$|E

25|$|A {{pressure}} reduction regulator {{is used to}} control the delivery pressure of the gas supplied to a free-flow helmet, in which the flow is continuous, to maintain the <b>downstream</b> <b>pressure</b> which {{is provided by the}} ambient pressure of the exhaust and the flow resistance of the delivery system - mainly the umbilical - and not influenced by the breathing of the diver. Gas reclaim systems use a third kind of regulator to control the flow of exhaled gas to the return hose. Rebreather systems may also use regulators to control the flow of fresh gas, and demand valves, known as automatic diluent valves, to maintain the volume in the breathing loop during descent.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the <b>downstream</b> <b>pressure,</b> but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E

Each microchannel has a trapezoidal cross section with long base 5. 38 micrometers and height 1. 90 micrometers, while its length is 5000 micrometers. The experiment {{is based on}} the constant volume method. The flow is driven by pressure gradient. The flow rate measurements refer to <b>downstream</b> <b>pressures</b> of 15. 1 kPa and 8. 05 kPa.

The measured flow rates are compared to the corresponding computational ones obtained by the numerical solution of the McCormack kinetic model. Very good agreement between the experimental and computational results is reached. The difference between the corresponding results is less than the experimental uncertainty.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{roles of}} neural and pressure gradient factors, causing a fall or maintenance of bronchial blood flow in exercising sheep, are unknown. These {{were examined in}} sheep prepared under thiopentone/isoflurane general anaesthesia with a pulsed Doppler probe mounted on the bronchial artery, and aortic pressure (Pa) catheter in superficial cervical artery. After recovery, Swan-Ganz catheters were inserted under local anaesthesia into the pulmonary artery. Bronchial flow and conductance (Qbr, Cbr), and pressure gradients (Pg; i. e. aortic minus right atrial, Pg_RAP; pulmonary artery, Pg_Ppa; and, left atrial (wedge) Pg_LAP) were derived from continuous records, after switching between downstream sites during and after moderately severe treadmill exercise (3. 8 km. h⁻¹, for 1. 7 min, 6 min recovery). The protocol was repeated after combined α₁,α₂-adrenoceptor/cholinoceptor blockade using phentolamine methanesulfonate and methscopolamine bromide. Bronchial flow fell in both receptor intact (INT) and (BL) blocked state. Pa rose in INT, but <b>downstream</b> <b>pressures</b> rose only 3. 7 (RAP), 2. 8 (Ppa) and 2. 0 (LAP) mmHg (P for each < 0. 05) in both INT and BL. Pg_RAP and Pg_Ppa did not rise, but Pg_LAP rose 4. 0 mmHg (P < 0. 05). In BL, Pa fell, as did Pg_RAP (7. 0 mmHg, P < 0. 05), Pg_Ppa (8. 9 mmHg, P < 0. 001), but Pg_LAP did not change. Thus, <b>downstream</b> <b>pressures</b> change by small amounts, and pressure gradients to RAP and Ppa sites do not change during moderately severe exercise in normal sheep. The fall in Qbr in INT is due to neural factors, but in BL {{is due to a}} fall in Pg.
