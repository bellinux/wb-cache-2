40|$|Abstract-During the {{back-end}} {{manufacturing process}} of IC, intervention of spot defects induces extra and missing material of <b>interconnects</b> causing circuit failures. In this paper, {{a new type}} of spot defects called <b>interconnect</b> “narrowing defect ” is defined. <b>Interconnect</b> narrowing occurs when spot defects induce missing material of <b>interconnects</b> without resulting in a complete cut. The narrow sites of defective <b>interconnects</b> favor electromigration that makes narrow <b>interconnects</b> more likely to induce a chip failure than regular <b>interconnects.</b> In this paper, a layout sensitivity model accounting for narrowing defects is derived. A methodology for predicting the probability of narrow <b>interconnects</b> using the sensitivity model is then proposed. The layout sensitivity model for narrow <b>interconnects</b> is tested and compared to actual and simulated data. Our layout sensitivity model for narrow <b>interconnects</b> predicts the probability of narrowing with 3. 1 % error, on average. The model is then combined with electromigration constraints to predict mean-time-to-failure of chips manufactured in future technology down to 32 nm node. The paper concludes with some other possible applications of the narrow <b>interconnect</b> predictive model. 1...|$|R
5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity.

Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power.

This paper presents, for the first time, a detailed investigation of MWCNT-based <b>interconnect</b> performance. A com-pact equivalent circuit model of MWCNTs is presented for the first time, and the performance of MWCNT <b>interconnects</b> is evaluated and compared against traditional Cu <b>interconnects,</b> as well as Single-Walled CNT (SWCNT) -based <b>interconnects,</b> at different <b>interconnect</b> levels (local, intermediate, and global) for future technology nodes. It is shown that at the intermediate and global levels, MWCNT <b>interconnects</b> can achieve smaller signal delay than that of Cu <b>interconnects,</b> and the improvements become more significant with technology scaling and increasing wire lengths. At 1000 -µm global or 500 -µm intermediate level <b>interconnects,</b> the delay of MWCNT <b>interconnects</b> can reach as low as 15 % of Cu <b>interconnect</b> delay. It is also shown that in order for SWCNT bundles to outperform MWCNT <b>interconnects,</b> dense and high metallic-fraction SWCNT bundles are necessary.
