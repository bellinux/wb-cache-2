A discussion of the data transmission environment is presented which attempts to characterize the channel noise and interference which degrades data transmission performance. The analysis considers channel degradation resulting from additive gaussian noise and various amplitudes and frequencies of sinewave interference which simulate the noise and interference environment {{likely to be found}} on cable systems. To assess the impact of the channel noise and interference, noncoherent binary frequency shift keying (FSK) using frequency <b>discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> was chosen as the basis for a theoretical and experimental investigation. To simplify the analysis, a linear model of frequency <b>discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> is presented which provides useful results in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The model was tested against laboratory experiments using an idealized FSK data transmission channel with controlled amounts of noise and interference. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results show reasonably good agreement, thus validating the model for certain noise and interference circumstances which are applicable to data transmission on two-way cable television systems. The results show that with an FSK carrier-to-sinewave interference ratio of 6 dB, an increase in carrier-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 dB is required to achieve the same 1 X 10 ⁻⁹ error rate. The usefulness of the study results for predicting FSK data transmission performance can be improved by incorporating empirical statistical data on interference ingress in the return path of the cable system...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{millions}} of customers {{all over the}} world have been subscribing to mobile telephony services which are based on modern digital transmission. At the high transmission bit rates that these systems use, the mobile radio channel exhibits frequency-selective fading characteristics. Under such conditions, the received signal could experience significant intersymbol interference (ISI) from severe distortion to the waveform of the received baseband signal. Therefore, such techniques as adaptive waveform equalisation or adaptive maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) are used in modern digital mobile radio telephone systems to combat this undesirable ISI. These adaptive schemes have almost always been used in conjunction with coherent demodulation in the receivers. This study examines the application of noncoherent demodulation, in the form of frequency <b>discriminator</b> <b>detection,</b> as an alternative to coherent demodulation. The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard has been used as the basis for this investigation. It has been shown analytically that in the presence of frequency-selective fading, a propagation environment common to the GSM system, the use of frequency <b>discriminator</b> <b>detection</b> gives rise to nonlinear ISI in the demodulated signal. It has also been shown that frequency-selective fading could cause large unwanted "spikes" to appear in the demodulated signal, thus leading to a severe degradation in the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. Consequently, several waveform distortion cancellation schemes for combatting the nonlinear ISI have been formulated. The BER performances of these proposed schemes, under various propagation conditions, have been studied by computer simulation. Furthermore, it has been observed that the undesirable "spikes", that occur in the demodulated signal due to frequency-selective fading, could be ++suppressed by the use of inverse-limiting in conjunction with frequency <b>discriminator</b> <b>detection.</b> As a result, an effective adaptive detection scheme has been formulated, based on modelling the combination of the GMSK modulator, the mobile channel, the frequency discriminator, and any transmit and receive fitters, as a finite-state machine. The transmitted data is then detected using an MLSE. The BER performance of this proposed adaptive detection scheme has been extensively investigated by computer simulation. This has been carried out assuming various propagation conditions, including the two-ray fading channel model with equal path powers and relative delays of up to four bit periods, the maximum relative delay considered in the GSM system. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive detection scheme in combatting IS] has been investigated by computer simulation based on the six-ray GSM empirical propagation models for typical urban (TU), hilly terrain (HT) and rural area (RA) environments. The computer simulated results confirm that the voice grade performance required for the GSM system could be achieved by the proposed adaptive detection scheme in all the recommended GSM propagation models considered. Furthermore, the BER performance of the receiver remains unaffected by a carrier frequency offset of up to 2 kHz...|$|E

40|$|The {{bit error}} rate (BER) {{performance}} of pi/ 4 -differential {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (DQPSK) modems in cellular mobile communication systems is derived and analyzed. The system is modeled as a frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channel corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and co-channel interference (CCI). The probability density function of the phase difference between two consecutive symbols of M-ary differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signals is first derived. In M-ary DPSK systems, the information is completely contained in this phase difference. For pi/ 4 -DQPSK, the BER is derived in a closed form and calculated directly. Numerical results show that for the 24 kBd (48 kb/s) pi/ 4 -DQPSK operated at a carrier frequency of 850 MHz and C/I less than 20 dB, the BER will be dominated by CCI if the vehicular speed is below 100 mi/h. In this derivation, frequency-selective fading is modeled by two independent Rayleigh signal paths. Only one co-channel is assumed in this derivation.

To allow for safe passage of a bolus through the pharynx, respiration is interrupted (swallowing apnoea); however, the control of airflow and diaphragmatic activity during swallowing and swallowing apnoea are not fully understood. Here, we validated a new airflow <b>discriminator</b> for <b>detection</b> of respiratory airflow and used it together with diaphragmatic and abdominal electromyography (EMG), spirometry and pharyngeal and oesophageal manometry. Co-ordination {{of breathing}} and spontaneous swallowing was examined in six healthy volunteers at rest, during hypercapnia and when breathing at 30 breaths min(- 1). The airflow discriminator proved highly reliable and enabled us to determine timing of respiratory airflow unambiguously in relation to pharyngeal and diaphragmatic activity. During swallowing apnoea, the passive expiration of the diaphragm was interrupted by static activity, i. e. an 'active breath holding', which preserved respiratory volume for expiration after swallowing. Abdominal EMG increased throughout pre- and post-swallowing expiration, more so during hyper- than normocapnia, possibly to assist expiratory airflow. In these six volunteers, swallowing was always preceded by expiration, and 93 and 85 % of swallows were also followed by expiration in normo- and hypercapnia, respectively, indicating that, in man, swallowing during the expiratory phase of breathing may be even more predominant than previously believed. This co-ordinated pattern of breathing and swallowing potentially reduces the risk for aspiration. Insights from these measurements in healthy volunteers and the airflow discriminator will be used for future studies on airway protection and effects of disease, drugs and ageing...|$|R

One of the key parameters of these detection systems is the dynamic range of the MCP's response to the input fluxes of charged particles. For most applications the dynamic range of the linear response should be as wide as possible. This is especially true for the Dual Electron Spectrometers (DESs) of the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) on NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission because a wide range of input fluxes are expected. To make use of the full available dynamic range, {{it is important to understand}} the MCP response behavior beyond the linear regime where the MCPs start to saturate. We have performed extensive studies of this during the characterization and calibration of the DES instruments and have identified several saturation effects of the detection system. The MCP itself exhibits saturation when the channels lack the ability to replenish charge sufficiently rapidly. It is found and will be shown that the ground system can significantly impact the correct measurement of this effect.
