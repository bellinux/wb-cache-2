5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt {{that it did not}} contain the <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1584, Virupaksha Pandita, {{the head}} priest at the Virupaksha Temple in Vijayanagara, wrote an account {{on the life}} and deeds of the 12th-century saint and vachana poet Chennabasava. The writing, titled Chenna Basava Purana, regards the protagonist as an {{incarnation}} of god Shiva and describes the glory of Shiva and his famous devotees. The book gives valuable information, including dates, about early Veerashaiva saints and vachanakaras (vachana poets). In addition to religious content, the writing provides useful <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> the former capital Vijayanagara, its royal palace, its market places and merchants, its military encampments, specialisations and divisions and the guilds of workers who served the military in various capacities. Other authors from the 16th century were Chermanka (Chermanka Kavya), Virabhadraraja (Virabhadra Vijaya), Chennabasavanka (Mahadevi Akkanna Purana), Nanjunda of Ikkeri (Bhairavaesvara Kavya) and Sadasiva Yogi (Ramanatha Vilasa).|$|E

25|$|The series raises, explores, {{and offers}} fresh <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> ethical and moral issues {{emerging}} from the paradoxical nature of a counterterrorism organization which resorts to terrorist methods to succeed in its own ostensibly altruistic goals, and the attendant dilemmas in which the generally unwilling operatives in such an organization find themselves. Nikita's unwavering belief {{in a kind of}} moral absolutism (as opposed to Section One's prescribed philosophy of situational ethics) consistently and coherently motivates the underlying dramatic plot conflicts in the majority of the episodes.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after it}} was released, the book was panned by critics. One of the {{frequently}} mentioned problems with the book was that it lacked the extensive editing that his previous article about Shelley had been given. Critics viewed his larger work as often digressive and full of tangents, and some lamented the significant amount of space that Hogg devoted to describing the meals that they ate together. Others {{pointed out that the}} book did not contain the novel <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> Shelley and his poetry that Shelley at Oxford had delivered. Shelley's family was surprised to read the depictions of the young Percy Shelley and some of the accounts greatly upset them.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein's {{suggestion}} (PI, §66) {{about the}} impossibility of formulating a definition of games portrays a predicament for disciplines, which entail games as their subject matter, because it denies the possibility to know what games are. One possible solution is {{to point out that}} Wittgenstein merely acts out his failing attempt to define the concept of game, because he wanted to demonstrate a mechanism of language. He wasn't particularly concerned about games, nor about the concept of 'game', but he was interested in the consequence of a definitory failure. The demonstration aims to show, that {{there is no reason to}} search for real definitions, which describe essential attributes of things, but rather nominal definitions, which describe the use of the term in a community. He connected this idea to language games – lingual expressions combined with action – as a more adequate alternative to explain the function of language. Confusing this is his choice to denominate the approach (PI, §7) as 'language games', further fueling the impression that he provides <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> the concept of game. Wittgenstein wasn't interested in games but in language, therefore his theories and examples are only superficially related to academic disciplines with games as subject matter.|$|E

500|$|The {{major themes}} of Winesburg, Ohio largely concern the {{interaction}} between the individual citizens of Winesburg and the world around them. As each of the book's stories focuses primarily (though not exclusively) on one character, the narrator develops these themes continuously, sometimes adding new <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> previously introduced characters (Elizabeth Willard's relationship with Dr. Reefy in [...] "Death", for example, was never alluded to when she was first introduced in [...] "Mother".). Because George Willard is a fixture in much of the book, his character arc becomes just as important a theme of Winesburg, Ohio as that of the rest of town's inhabitants.|$|E

500|$|Much work in {{neurolinguistics}} involves {{testing and}} evaluating theories {{put forth by}} psycholinguists and theoretical linguists. [...] In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms. [...] For example, experiments in sentence processing have used the ELAN, N400, and P600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as Janet Fodor and Lyn Frazier's [...] "serial" [...] model, and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's [...] "unification model". [...] Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> the physiology of the brain, by [...] "generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure".|$|E
500|$|Calitoxin {{and other}} sea anemone toxins {{are used in}} {{studying}} ion channels, with potential applications in biomedical and physiology research. [...] In the mature CLX, one base-pair substitution is responsible for a single glutamic acid to lysine replacement in the coding region of CLX-2, leading {{to the difference between}} the two isoforms. The structural organization of these two genes show a high degree of homology. This suggests that the two different peptides have the same biological function. This cannot yet be confirmed because only CLX-1 has been isolated from C.parasitica. [...] Calitoxin has a very different sequence from another sodium channel binding sea anemone toxin, ATX II, which is produced [...] by the distantly related Anemonia sulcata. [...] A better understanding of these differences might offer <b>insights</b> <b>about</b> the function of particular amino acid residues. [...] Despite markedly dissimilar gene sequences, CLX-1 affects crustacean axon potentials similar to two other classes of anemone toxins. [...] Alternatively, certain aspects of the structure of the CLX genes are found in scorpion toxins as well as other sea anemone toxins that block potassium channels.|$|E
