2500|$|Though power chords are {{not true}} chords per se, as the term [...] "chord" [...] is {{generally}} defined as three or more different notes (pitch classes) sounded simultaneously, and a power chord contains only two pitch classes (the root, the fifth, and often a doubling of the root at the octave), power chords are still expressed using a version of chord notation.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} encountered tunings or note layouts used for tremolo harmonicas. The older layout {{is very similar}} to that used in the standard diatonic harmonica and also found in diatonic accordions and concertinas. This tuning has the major diatonic scale in the middle and top octaves of the harmonica with two chords in the lowest octave: the tonic in the blow and the dominant or <b>fifth</b> <b>chord</b> in the draw. This is very effective for chordal playing behind relatively simple folk melodies in either the tonic or the fifth of the key of the harmonica. In Asia, the fourths and the sixths are added back in, in order to play the melody; however, it is still unlike the scale tuning mentioned below, since the octaves are not repeated throughout the layout.|$|E

5000|$|Cretan {{music has}} been largely heterophonic in texture or {{accompanied}} by drones and <b>fifth</b> <b>chords</b> on Cretan lute, classical guitar, mandolin, boulgari, and so forth. Drones are also played simultaneously on melody instruments such as the lyra and violin by bowing a second string (usually open) simultaneously as one plays the melody notes on another string. Especially in earlier and more amateur settings where a second accompanying instrument was often absent, a lyra player accompanied himself by playing not only a drone string but also with a distinctively rhythmic bowing style in order to ring the gerakokoudhouna (small [...] "falcon bells") that were attached to his bow. It is much more common today for the lyra {{to be accompanied by}} one or more other instruments, and for lyra players to employ a violin bow.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{versions}} of the [...] "Flutina" [...] had a few open (tonic and <b>fifth)</b> <b>chords</b> available on the bass side, {{in addition to the}} silent [...] "air" [...] key. The most famous maker of these [...] "flutina" [...] accordions was Busson of Paris. Busson also is thought to have had a part {{in the development of the}} piano accordion (circa 1880s). The heyday of the [...] "Flutina" [...] was approximately from 1840 to 1880. In the United States of America, the more robust steel-reeded German Melodians [...] "won out" [...] over these brass-reeded, soft, and delicate [...] "accordion melodiques".

50|$|Alternate tunings {{other than}} symmetrically stepped-down {{versions}} of standard or drop-D tuning (where the lowest string is tuned down two half-steps for simple barred power or <b>fifth</b> <b>chords)</b> are rare in modern guitar music, {{but before the}} nineteenth century they occurred more often. Drop-D tuning remains common. The sixteenth-century guitar typically had four courses (rather than six strings, as the modern classical does), and the seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century guitar typically had five courses. These were subject {{to a variety of}} tunings, such that there is some difficulty establishing which, if any, to consider the standard tuning from which the others deviate. It is sometimes suggested that classical guitarists wishing to read Renaissance lute or vihuela tablature tune their guitar E-A-d-f-b-e' since these instruments in this period usually have the major third between the 3rd and 4th strings.|$|R
5000|$|Sternklang {{creates a}} sense of [...] "non-progressive or {{circular}} time by blurring complex relationships between pitch and rhythm based on the overtone series so that the structure is perceived as inexhaustible and thus appears static" [...] The entire composition is based on five just-intoned harmonic sounds, each containing eight tones corresponding to the second through ninth partials of the overtone series. One of these tones in each chord is the E above middle C, tuned to 330 Hz. In the first chord this functions as the ninth partial, in the second chord as the eighth partial, and so on to the <b>fifth</b> <b>chord,</b> where it is the fifth partial. Compositionally, the harmonic structure fluctuates between an extreme situation in which all five groups share the same chord and the opposite extreme where each group's chord is different [...]|$|E
5000|$|You {{can create}} any tuning by tuning to the {{notes of the}} chord. If you play power chords most of the time, tune to a <b>fifth</b> <b>chord</b> by repeating the two notes in the chord. For example, the C5 chord is just notes C & G, so to tune to that tuning, tune all of your strings to C or G. If you want to tune to Csus4, you use the notes in that chord, so you would use the notes C,F, and G, tuning your strings to those notes. If the string tension gets too high, tune to a lower note, so you don't snap a string. One tip {{is to change the}} {{frequency}} of your tuner from around 440 to around 430. This prevent breaks and will lower the sound of your guitar as a whole, giving it more bass.|$|E

5000|$|In fact, {{the title}} Capriccio {{was a direct}} {{reference}} to the famously brilliant Caprices for violin by Niccolò Paganini, which Ligeti had encountered as a child. In contrast to the lyrical, rubato Dialogo, the Capriccio is written almost entirely in an unrelenting 3/8 pattern, breaking only once, abruptly in the middle for a truncated reminiscence of the Dialogo. The opening is marked [...] "Presto con slancio" [...] (very quick with impetus) and [...] "forte vigoroso". Two interval-motifs are exclaimed separately, which are then woven together with increasing intricacy in a massive crescendo, which subsides into a modal sounding second theme, the tones of which alternate with a pedal tone of A. This theme and the opening motifs share a tritone relationship, a compositional device prominently used by Bartók. The modal melody is once again reiterated, this time [...] "tremolo sul tasto", (over the fingerboard) and harmonized with a perfect <b>fifth</b> above, a <b>chord</b> planing technique which also reflects Bartók's influence. A new rhythmic section erupts consisting of disjunct perfect <b>fifth</b> <b>chords.</b> This heralds {{the beginning of a}} pseudo-development section, in which the second theme is elaborated. The Dialogo returns briefly, and is followed by a full recapitulation and coda, finally ending exuberantly (with tutta la forza) in G major.|$|R

50|$|In the baroque era, a set {{of rules}} {{developed}} for voice leading in four-part harmony. The bass voice would be assigned the root of the chord, although it would occasionally be assigned to the fifth. If the chord is a triad, the root is generally double by one of the other voices. Voices never cross; that is, the soprano part would always be the highest in pitch, the next highest would be the alto, next the tenor, and the bass would be lowest. When two voices harmonized in perfect intervals, they were forbidden from staying in the same perfect harmony in the next chord, also known as moving in parallel. Another rule concerns authentic cadences. In such cadences, the leading tones are required to resolve to the tone a half step away. That is, the voice that plays the 7th must also play the resolution up to the tonic, and if the <b>fifth</b> <b>chord</b> is a dominant seventh, the fourth must resolve down to the third. These rules are still obeyed now in strict four part harmonizations, although most compositions now apply less strict forms of voice leading.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if a song is in C Major, and the {{songwriter}} aims {{to get to}} {{a chorus}} that focuses on the dominant chord (G Major) being tonicized (treated like a [...] "home key" [...] for a short period), he could use a chord progression for the pre-chorus that gets the listener ready to hear the chorus' chord (G Major) as an arrival key. One widely used way to accomplish this is to precede the G Major chord with its own ii-V7 chords. In the key given, ii of G Major would be an A minor chord. V7 of G Major would be D7. As such, with the example song, this could be done by having a pre-chorus that consists of one bar of a minor and one bar of D7. This would lead the listener to expect a resolution from ii-V to I, which in this case is the temporary tonic of G Major. The chord a minor would not be unusual to the listener, as it is a shared chord that exists in both G Major and C Major. A minor is the ii chord in G Major, and it is the vi chord in C Major. The chord that would alert the listener that a change was taking place is the D7 chord. There is no D7 chord in C Major. A listener experienced with popular and traditional music would hear that this is a secondary dominant. Harmonic theorists and arrangers would call it V7/V or [...] "five of five", as the D7 chord is the dominant (or <b>fifth)</b> <b>chord</b> of G Major.|$|E
5000|$|In drop D {{the three}} open bass strings form a D5 power <b>chord.</b> Other <b>fifth</b> <b>chords</b> are made when barred with {{the index finger}} of the {{fretting}} hand shifted up the fretboard. Drop D tuning is frequently used in heavy metal and its various subgenres, as guitarists in these styles often need fast transitions between power chords. Drop D is also used in metal because it adds two lower semitones to the bass range of the rhythm guitar, which adds two more low-range power chords (Eb and D) and enables a [...] "heavier", deeper sound. The tuning has also been used in many other styles of music, including blues, country, folk, and classical. Due to its similarity to standard tuning, drop D is recognised as a useful introduction to alternative tunings, leading logically to an exploration of DADGAD, open D and drop D drop G (in which both the 5th and 6th strings are dropped a tone) tunings.|$|R
