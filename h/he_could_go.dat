5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he actually did so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Division {{moved to}} France in March 1916. Berryman became a {{temporary}} captain on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as a trainee staff captain. During the Second Battle of Bullecourt he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He {{was appointed to}} command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary major on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This {{was as far as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them a broad range of experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore was a night race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 {{for the first and}} 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that the gap between the first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five {{towards the end of the}} session. While Ricciardo felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> even faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat was able to put in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.|$|E

25|$|Charles I (Karl I), {{the last}} Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, went to Madeira after the war. Determined {{to prevent an}} attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into exile on Madeira because it was {{isolated}} in the Atlantic and easily guarded. He died there on 1 April 1922 and is buried in Monte.|$|E

25|$|In February 1982, Mbeki's brother Jama disappeared. He {{was later}} presumed dead. In 1985, PW Botha {{declared}} a State of Emergency {{and gave the}} army and police special powers. In 1986, the South African Army sent a captain in the South African Defence Force (SADF) to kill Mbeki. The plan was to put a bomb in his house in Lusaka, but the assassin was arrested by the Zambian police before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> through with the plan.|$|E

He then orders the preparation of his ship so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> rescue his son and sends Death Commandos to kill the Phoenix's host. He is overwhelmed by the combined Phoenix Force Five and forced to recuperate at the X-Mansion.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Johnson {{established}} {{what would be}} a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood, Jr. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> home with them, and in most cases he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{decided to}} help fight for the Empire and sent 6,500 mounted troops to assist the British efforts, making the war New Zealand's first {{overseas}} military campaign. Virtually every man in New Zealand was desperately keen to get to war, so the first soldiers to go were {{selected on the basis}} of who could afford to go. If a man could provide his own horse, rifle and equipment, costing about £25 in total, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to war. The first two of the 10 contingents paid their own way. The proposal to send the first contingent – 200 mounted riflemen – was approved by Parliament prior to the outbreak of war on 28 September 1899. Prime Minister Richard Seddon's proposition to do so was overwhelmingly supported, meeting opposition from only five members of parliament.|$|E
25|$|After the United States entered World War I, Gates {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy in September 1917. He was mustered in as an ensign and {{assigned}} to the Pay Corps, which was responsible to managing the payroll of the navy. In December {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant and transferred overseas to work in the War Risk Insurance Bureau based in Ireland where he was employed to sell bonds to insure government war assets. He personally sold over $1 million in bonds, almost entirely to naval personal. In April 1919 he was transferred to France where he was placed in command of an airbase that was being constructed. The base was finished just as the war ended and Gates was offered a position in the Belgian relief effort, but he turned down the offer so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> home.|$|E

25|$|Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he {{believed}} he could turn the Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped {{and he had the}} help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was {{in the center of the}} line and too far away to support Sheridan but he could move the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> through the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E. Pickett was about to change the situation and options of the Union commanders.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of June 910, {{according}} to the plan devised by Gen. Butler and Maj. Winthrop, 3,500 Union soldiers were sent in two columns from Camp Hamilton at Hampton and Camp Butler at Newport News with orders to converge near the Confederate positions at Little Bethel after a night march and launch a surprise attack on the Confederate positions at Little Bethel at dawn. After taking Little Bethel, if {{the commander of the}} force chose to do so, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to attack Big Bethel. The entire force was under the immediate overall command of Brig. Gen. Ebenezer W. Peirce, a Massachusetts militia general of apparent bravery but no regular army, military school or other formal military training or combat experience. Earlier in the day on June 9 Butler had summoned Peirce from Camp Hamilton to Fort Monroe to advise him of the plan. Foreshadowing the further difficulties which would arise during the operation, Peirce was too ill to ride his horse and went to the fort by boat.|$|E
