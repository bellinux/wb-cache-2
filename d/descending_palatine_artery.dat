5000|$|<b>Descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> (Greater palatine artery {{and lesser}} palatine artery) ...|$|E
50|$|According to Terminologia Anatomica, the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> {{branches}} {{into the}} {{greater palatine artery}} and lesser palatine arteries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> is {{a branch}} of the third part of the maxillary artery {{supplying}} the hard and soft palate.|$|E
30|$|Branches of {{the first}} mandibular part of the MA sit between the initial mandibular part and the {{posterior}} part of LPM. They include the auricular artery deep to the external acoustic meatus, the tympanic artery anterior to the tympanic membrane, the middle meningeal artery (MMA) to the dura mater (with calvaria), the accessory meningeal artery to the cranial cavity, and the alveolar artery inferior to the mandibular gingiva and teeth. The {{second part of the}} MA is the pterygoid portion between LPM and PPF. It mainly serves the masticatory muscles and includes the masseteric artery, deep temporal artery, pterygoid branch, and buccal artery. The third pterygopalatine part comprises a short course in the PPF, from the sphenopalatine artery to the sphenopalatine foramen. It includes the posterior superior alveolar, infraorbital, <b>descending</b> <b>palatine,</b> sphenopalatine <b>artery,</b> and artery of pterygoid canal.|$|R

50|$|The canal transmits the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> vessels, {{the greater}} palatine nerve, and the lesser palatine nerve.|$|R
50|$|The {{greater palatine}} canal (or pterygopalatine canal) is {{a passage in}} the skull that transmits the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> vein, and greater and lesser palatine nerves between the pterygopalatine fossa and the oral cavity.|$|E
5000|$|In this {{opening the}} {{orifices}} of two lateral canals are visible; they are named the incisive canals or foramina of Stenson; through {{each of them}} passes the terminal branch of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the nasopalatine nerve.|$|E
50|$|Crossing {{the under}} {{surface of the}} sphenoid the sphenopalatine artery ends on the nasal septum as the {{posterior}} septal branches; these anastomose with the ethmoidal arteries and the septal branch of the superior labial; one branch descends in a groove on the vomer to the incisive canal and anastomoses with the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} feeding vessel to the maxilla. The surgeon should know the surgical anatomy of greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> to avoid trauma in maxilla which leads to ischemic problems. Aim: The CT evaluation of the distance between Pyriform aperture and the greater palatine foramen in various ages of both sexes. Result: The distance varies according to sex and age which are measured by CT and standardised. Discussion: The lateral nasal osteotomy can be done upto 25 mm depth, instead of 20 mm. Conclusion: By this study it shows that the lateral nasal wall osteotomy can be performed without injury to greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery...</b>|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>arteries</b> {{go through}} the lesser palatine foramina, and supply the soft palate.|$|R
50|$|His name is {{associated}} with the eponymous Kiesselbach's plexus, which is the site where the anterior ethmoid <b>artery,</b> greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> sphenopalatine artery and superior labial artery anastomose in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum.|$|R
50|$|The <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> {{branches}} {{off of the}} maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa and descends {{through the}} greater palatine canal along with the greater palatine nerve (from the pterygopalatine ganglion). Once emerging from the greater palatine foramen, it changes names to the greater palatine artery and begins to supply the hard palate. As it terminates it travels through the incisive canal to anastomose with the sphenopalatine artery to supply the nasal septum.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{supply is}} {{provided}} by tonsillar branches of five arteries: the dorsal lingual artery (of the lingual artery), ascending palatine artery (of the facial artery), tonsillar branch (of the facial artery), ascending pharyngeal artery (of the external carotid artery), and the lesser palatine artery ({{a branch of the}} <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> itself a branch of the maxillary artery).The tonsils venous drainage is by the peritonsillar plexus, which drain into the lingual and pharyngeal veins, which in turn drain into the internal jugular vein.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Understanding {{the anatomy}} of the pterygomaxillary {{junction}} region helps prevent blood loss in Le Fort I osteotomy. Here, we determined {{the location of the}} <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the structure of the pterygomaxillary region. Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 82 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with and without maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 164 sides were measured and divided into right versus left, men versus women, and bimaxillary osteotomy (B) versus mandibular osteotomy (S). Lateral and frontal cephalograms and computed tomography (CT) were analysed for all patients. The relationship between the cephalometric measurements and the measurements of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and pterygoid plate (PP) were assessed. Results: There were no significant correlations between measurements of cephalograms and those of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and PPs. There were significant differences between right and left in lateral plate length (p = 0. 0014) and thickness of PP (p = 0. 0047). There were significant {{differences between men and women}} in right width of PP (p = 0. 0034), right thickness of PP (p = 0. 0063), left posterior length (p = 0. 0196), and left thickness of PP (p = 0. 0279). The B group had a shorter anterior length than the S group (right: p < 0. 0001, left: p = 0. 0027). Conclusion: These results suggest that the location of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the morphology of the PPs were not significantly associated with any cephalometric measurements. CT examination is necessary to recognize {{the anatomy of}} pterygomaxillary region and the exact positions of <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> before Le Fort I osteotomy. © 2009 European Association for Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery...|$|E
50|$|The greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> is a {{terminal}} {{branch of the}} maxillary artery supplying blood to the hard palate and nasal septum.|$|R
50|$|The {{ascending}} <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> is {{an artery}} {{in the head}} that branches off the facial artery and runs up the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|R
50|$|Crossing {{the under}} {{surface of the}} sphenoid, the sphenopalatine artery ends on the nasal septum as the {{posterior}} septal branches. Here it will anastomose with {{the branches of the}} greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{tonsillectomy}} procedure {{itself is}} not technically demanding, but unexpected excessive hemorrhage is a constant risk due to a surplus of blood supply to the tonsils and surrounding pharyngeal soft tissues. The superior tonsil pole is supplied by the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> (DPA), the midfossa region by the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the inferior pole by the tonsillar and ascending palatine branches of the facial artery and the tonsillar branches of the lingual artery. In spite of the abundant circulation, no serious immediate or delayed postoperative hemorrhage was noted in this case series.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{report a}} case of {{epistaxis}} in a 74 -year-old male patient. His recent medical history documented recurrent nasal bleeding and a Le Fort 1 osteosynthesis 3 weeks before admission to our unit. A CT scan revealed a left <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> pseudoaneurysm in the left maxillary sinus, that was successfully embolized. Pseudoaneurysms of the internal maxillary artery and its branches are rare life-threatening complications. This diagnosis should be considered when confronted to recurrent head and neck bleeding, especially {{in a context of}} recent maxillo-facial trauma or surgery. Embolization should rapidly be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{separation}} of the pterygomaxillary region at the posterior nasal spine level after Le Fort I osteotomy in Class III patients. Patients and Methods: The study group consisted of 37 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 74 sides were examined. Le Fort I osteotomy was performed without a pterygoid osteotome, with an ultrasonic curette used to remove interference at the pterygomaxillary region. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was analyzed for all patients. The separation of the pterygomaxillary region and the location of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> were assessed. Results: Although acceptable separation between the maxilla and pterygoid plates was achieved in all patients, an exact separation of the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level was found in only 18 of 74 sides (24 %). In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), the separation occurred anterior to the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> In 29 of 74 sides (39. 2 %), complete separation between the maxilla and lateral and/or medial pterygoid plate was not achieved, but lower level separation of the maxilla and pterygoid plate was always complete. The maxillary segments could be moved to the postoperative ideal position in all cases. Conclusion: Le Fort I osteotomy without an osteotome does not always induce an exact separation at the pterygomaxillary junction at the posterior nasal spine level, but the ultrasonic bone curette can remove the interference between maxillary segment and pterygoid plates more safely. © 2009 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons...|$|E
50|$|Through {{each of them}} ascends the {{terminal}} branch of the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> while the nasopalatine nerve descends, to anastomose with the posterior septal branch of sphenopalatine artery and the greater palatine nerve respectively.|$|R
50|$|At either {{posterior}} {{angle of}} the hard palate is the greater palatine foramen, for the transmission of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> vessels and greater palatine nerve; and running anteriorly (forward) and medially (towards the center-line) from it is a groove, for the same vessels and nerve.|$|R
50|$|Branches are {{distributed}} to the gums, the palatine glands, and the mucous membrane of {{the roof of the}} mouth; while in the pterygopalatine canal it gives off twigs which descend in the lesser palatine canals to supply the soft palate and palatine tonsil, anastomosing with the ascending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 853 - 855 The nasopalatine canal is a {{relatively}} long narrow structure located in the midline of the maxilla that contains the nasopalatine nerve and terminal branch of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> Anatomical variations related to this structure have been reported. This article aimed to report {{a case of a}} complete additional nasopalatine canal on a 53 -year-old female patient who underwent an examination by cone beam computed tomography. On sagittal slices, it was possible to observe the presence of an additional canal anterior and superior to the nasopalatine canal, separated by a bony septum. Each canal extended from independent superior openings (located in the nasal cavity) to independent openings located in the remaining alveolar process of the anterior maxilla. Identification of individual anatomical variations, especially involving neurovascular structures, {{plays an important role in}} the successful outcomes of surgical procedures involving the anterior maxilla...|$|E
50|$|The {{ascending}} <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> arises {{close to}} {{the origin of the}} facial artery and passes up between the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus {{to the side of the}} pharynx along which it is continued between the superior pharyngeal constrictor and the medial pterygoid muscle to near the base of the skull.|$|R
30|$|The {{success rate}} of cleft palate surgery is {{influenced}} by many factors. The main flap for the cleft palate surgery is fed by the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> [24]. If the palatal defect is wide, the flap width will be narrowed. These long narrow flaps may cause problems with blood circulation, and wide expanses of exposed raw bone surface can cause extensive wound contracture after the operation [24 – 26]. Ischemic damage and wound contracture is {{the main cause of}} postoperative palatal fistula. The incidence of postoperative palatal fistula is reported to be 4.6 – 12.5 % and is dependent on the degree of the tissue defect [27]. Wound contracture after operation can cause shortening of the soft palate and may result in velopharyngeal insufficiency [28].|$|R
50|$|The lesser palatine canals {{start from}} the greater palatine canal, and run with them, also opening into {{the roof of the}} oral cavity. Their {{openings}} are known as the lesser palatine foramina, and they transmit the lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> vein, and nerve, as wll as the middle palatine vessels and nerve.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{perforated}} {{by numerous}} foramina for {{the passage of}} the nutrient vessels; is channelled at the back part of its lateral border by a groove, sometimes a canal, for the transmission of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> vessels and the anterior palatine nerve from the spheno-palatine ganglion; and presents little depressions for the lodgement of the palatine glands.|$|R
50|$|The sphenopalatine artery {{passes through}} the sphenopalatine foramen into the cavity of the nose, at the back part of the {{superior}} meatus. Here it gives off its posterior lateral nasal branches which spread forward over the conchæ and meatuses, anastomose with the ethmoidal arteries and the nasal branches of the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine,</b> and assist in supplying the frontal, maxillary, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} site of {{haemorrhage}} in maxillary osteotomies is the posterior maxilla. Better {{understanding of the}} anatomy in this region may minimize possible vascular complications. The aim {{of the study was}} to study the osteology of the posterior maxillary region and establish clinical safety guidelines for the Le Fort I osteotomy. Thirty human dry skulls were selected and assessed by a combination of direct inspection, computerized imaging and computed tomography (CT) scan analysis. Results showed that the presence of maxillary third molars influenced the transverse angulation of the posterior vertical cut. Synostosis of the pterygomaxillary junction was noted in 12 % of samples. The mean length of the medial sinus wall from the piriform rim to the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> canal at the Le Fort I level was 34 mm. The three-dimensional CT-reconstructed <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> canal ran at 60 ° anteroinferiorly to the palatine plane and slightly medially to the exit through the greater palatine foramen. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|The first {{description}} of a technique for closing oroantral fistula using a full-thickness palatal flap based on greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> dates back to Ashley [15]. Advantages of the palatal flap include high vascularity, generous thickness, and quality of tissue. Moreover, this flap is more resilient, less prone to infection, very resistant to lacerations, and {{does not lead to}} lowering of the vestibule. However, the most significant disadvantages are flap necrosis [15], exposed bony surface, pain, and development of surface irregularities as a result of secondary epithelialization post operatively [2]. In 1980, Ehrl employed this technique with wide fistulas of 1  cm in diameter [16]. The technique consists of excising the epithelium from its edges and incising the palatal fibro-mucosa so as to create a flap with a posterior base, supplied by the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> The anterior extension of the flap must be wide enough to exceed the diameter of the bony defect and long enough to allow lateral rotation. Tension-free suturing should be performed [8].|$|R
25|$|Like the face, {{the human}} nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus {{supplied}} with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel {{supply to the}} nose is two-fold: (i) branches from the internal carotid artery, the branch of the anterior ethmoid artery, the branch of the posterior ethmoid artery, which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from the external carotid artery, the sphenopalatine <b>artery,</b> the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> the superior labial artery, and the angular artery.|$|R
50|$|It divides {{near the}} levator veli palatini muscle into two branches: one {{supplies}} and follows {{the course of}} this muscle, and, winding over the upper border of the superior pharyngeal constrictor, supplies the soft palate and the palatine glands, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side and with the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> branch of the maxillary artery; the other pierces the superior pharyngeal constrictor and supplies the palatine tonsil and auditory tube, anastomosing with the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery.|$|R
50|$|The maxillary {{surface is}} rough and {{irregular}} throughout {{the greater part}} of its extent, for articulation with the nasal surface of the maxilla; its upper and back part is smooth where it enters into the formation of the pterygopalatine fossa; it is also smooth in front, where it forms the posterior part of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. On the posterior part of this surface is a deep vertical groove, converted into the pterygopalatine canal, by articulation with the maxilla; this canal transmits the <b>descending</b> <b>palatine</b> vessels, and the anterior palatine nerve.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{main artery}} that {{supplies}} the mucoperiosteum {{of the hard}} palate is the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> The knowledge detailed of the vascular anatomy of the palate and, in special, of {{the region of the}} greater palatine foramen is important for prevention of lesions vascular during procedures in this region. Among these procedures, it included the making of shreds for correction of failures in the hard palate, soft palate and cranial base. Objective: To develop an anatomical model that can illustrate the endoscopic anatomy of the greater palatine foramen and analyze the technical of injection intra vascular of colored silicone is sufficient for fill the lower arterial branches than irrigate the hard palate. Method: The form of study was experimental through the endoscopic dissection of 10 greater <b>palatine</b> <b>arteries</b> in five heads of corpses prepared with injection intra vascular of colored silicone.
