This would keep pressure on this army in the hope of denying them time to complete their reorganisation, <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} last about one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E

The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} XXI Corps {{headquarters}} at El Kastine, {{the decision was made}} to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills. This decision, to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Seventh Army in the Judean Hills, was to keep the pressure on this Ottoman army with the hope of capturing Jerusalem, while denying them time to complete their reorganisation, <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
25|$|The {{tunnelling}} {{work was}} done by hand. The usual danger from the extensive use of explosives in the tunnels and cuttings was increased by the unstable nature of the rock and the steep drop {{down the side of}} the Barron Gorge. The average slope of the ground was 45 degrees, covered with a disjointed layer of decomposed soil and rock varying in depth from 5 to 8m. Robb had to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> into hillsides to find solid ground, and multiple deviations from the original surveyed route also increased his costs. Red Bluff and Glacier Rock were exposed when earth, rocks and trees were removed, again by hand, from above the line (escarpments had to be cleared and levelled back).|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{rebellion}} by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> trenches, as it was hot summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, and there was only one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders.|$|E

MTV later {{reviewed the}} New York performance on the 27th and called Ocean [...] "an audience charmer". The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica gave a positive review to the same New York performance, calling Ocean a [...] "versatile singer" [...] and writing that [...] "in his elegant, savvy, slightly crooked postsoul, he shifts sneakily between the two topics, singing about love as a byproduct of music and using the subject of music to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> about love." ...|$|E

500|$|Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya {{play the}} role of the titular procurer. A Hindi {{language}} remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia’s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that [...] "if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost disliked the film, and wrote that [...] " [...] – who has been so wonderful in the past – is unable to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> and summon up a relatable human being, because {{there is nothing in the}} writing that she can dig into." ...|$|E
500|$|Out of the ruts and {{the ways}} of its village, Selborne {{fashioned}} a new natural history. [...] It spoke simply, with a human voice. [...] But it looked profoundly. [...] It pioneered a way for students of nature who wished, as White did, not to roam the high Arctic or far Pacific but to fathom their own terrain. [...] It offered a wide world to anyone willing to <b>dig</b> <b>deep.</b> [...] Selborne said: [...] watch narrowly, skim close to the ground. [...] It whispered, hushed, what Thoreau would later broadcast: [...] "We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. [...] Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. [...] We know not where we are." [...] In those words, as in all Walden, Thoreau may have had in mind the village of Selborne and the Reverend Gilbert White--the town reached only by ruts running well beneath the surface, the man whose book had leapt the ruts to round the globe.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+", {{and called it}} [...] "the strongest straight-up, non-experimental {{standalone}} the season’s had so far," [...] {{as well as one}} of [...] "the strongest 'scary' episode since season five. [...] " [...] He praised the guest cast—mostly notably Drago and Morrison—and wrote that the writers of the episode were able to successfully make the character deaths in the episode count in a way that moved the audience. VanDerWerff's main criticism of the episode was that it painted Peattie [...] "as a backwoods hick and a rather broad stereotype of one." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a moderately positive review. Despite slightly criticizing the episode utilizing a voodoo-based plot, which he called [...] " [...] terribly original", he concluded that [...] "there's nothing wrong with a little modern medicine vs. practical magic confrontation. And I definitely enjoyed how Scully had her envelope pushed once again". Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars, noting, [...] "writer Vince Gilligan gets fairly serious in this ep concerning a series of deadly hexes cast upon a doctor and his family, as well as some cryptic scrawlings. There's plenty of bad mojo going around as the X-Files team gets to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> into {{the dark side of the}} magick arts, with Scully at one point losing her sight, thanks to a vengeful hex doll. Spooky". [...] TV Guide later named the episode's main antagonist, Orell Peattie, as one of [...] "The Scariest X-Files Monsters". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She concluded that [...] "although 'Theef' is burdened with some illogical plot developments and some underdeveloped characterization, overall it is a decent installment of The X-Files".|$|E

2500|$|Tubridy met his wife, the {{producer}} Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 {{when he spotted}} her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: [...] "She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn't that hard really if you <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> enough, and I asked her out." [...] The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003. Tubridy proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a [...] "favourite haunt" [...] of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in The Irish Times with the words [...] "Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie".|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and <b>dig</b> <b>deep</b> this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
