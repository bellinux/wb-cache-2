In particular, we combine, implement, modify and test {{a vast majority}} of SPH improvement techniques in the latest instalment of the GADGET code. We use the Wendland kernel functions, a particle wake-up time-step limiting mechanism and a time-dependent scheme for artificial viscosity, which includes a high-order gradient computation and shear <b>flow</b> <b>limiter.</b> Additionally, we include a novel prescription for time-dependent artificial conduction, which corrects for gravitationally induced pressure gradients and largely improves the SPH performance in capturing the development of gas-dynamical instabilities. We extensively test our new implementation {{in a wide range of}} hydrodynamical standard tests including weak and strong shocks as well as shear flows, turbulent spectra, gas mixing, hydrostatic equilibria and self-gravitating gas clouds. We jointly employ all modifications; however, when necessary we study the performance of individual code modules. We approximate hydrodynamical states more accurately and with significantly less noise than standard SPH. Furthermore, the new implementation promotes the mixing of entropy between different fluid phases, also within cosmological simulations. Finally, we study the performance of the hydrodynamical solver in the context of radiative galaxy formation and non-radiative galaxy cluster formation. We find galactic disks to be colder, thinner and more extended and our results on galaxy clusters show entropy cores instead of steadily declining entropy profiles. In summary, we demonstrate that our improved SPH implementation overcomes most of the undesirable limitations of standard SPH, thus becoming the core of an efficient code for large cosmological simulations.

40|$|Flow restricting {{devices were}} studied for their {{suitability}} as liquid water propellant <b>flow</b> <b>limiters</b> for the biowaste resistojet. Flow limiting during the start-up transient {{is required to}} prevent thrustor instabilities and icing which could result in heater failure in the electrical resistance heated thrustor (resistojet). The study was directed toward simple devices which would function passively (i. e., without power except from the propellant flow itself), and would offer high reliability and simplicity. In addition to the flow limiting devices, a thermal pumping system was studied to determine whether CO 2, desorbed from molecular sieves could be pumped thermally in a space station application. The thermal pump is considered a possible replacement for mechanical pumps. It involves a cyclic, constant volume cryopumping system which employs space radiators to achieve the cryotemperatures.

40|$|The {{integrated}} modeling approach {{intends to}} provide for design and performance analysis of on-demand pressurized irrigation systems using several flow regimes. A water balance model (WBM) is used for computing demands at the hydrant level. By aggregating such demands., {{the distribution of the}} discharges at the upstream end of an on-demand irrigation system is obtained. This provides for the selection of the maximum discharge to be supplied by the network according to a present operation quality. After selecting the upstream discharge a random generation model (RGM) is used to generate a large range of discharge configurations. The Labye iterative discontinuous method and a linear programming formulation have been extended for computing the optimal pipe diameters when several flow regimes occur. Networks designed in that way are analysed. Models (AKLA, FLUCS) have been tested developed and validated in order to perform the hydraulic analysis of the system, including the impacts of the characteristics curves of the hydrants and of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>limiters.</b> The analysis is completed with computational of performance indicators., reliability and resilience, for each hydrant using random generated configurations of hydrant simultaneously operating.

A high temporal and spatial resolution camera, based on an infra-red 128 x 128 pixels focal plane array detector has been used to perform the measurements. Comparing the power profile for the same discharge as inferred from two images taken just before the disruption and at the thermal quench, it is possible to assess that: the radial exponential decay of the power <b>flowing</b> onto the <b>limiter</b> shows in both cases two different e-folding lengths, a short one (of the order of 2 mm or even less, in disruptive discharges) in the first few mm of the SOL depth and a larger one (1. 5 cm) deeper in the SOL, An energy balance has been performed based on thermal images of both the limiter and the nearby wall during the thermal quench.

40|$|A simple {{analytic}} fluid model {{based on}} particle and momentum conservation describes {{the response of}} the scrape-off layer to an applied radial electric field. The model explains why the variation of plenum pressure during limiter biasing in TEXTOR shows the opposite behaviour as divertor biasing in Tokamak de Varennes: the mechanical baffles that define the throats of the pump limiter are aligned along the magnetic field, thus preventing collection of the induced perpendicular flux when the drift is directed towards the scoop. Rather, the optimal pumping is expected when the drift is directed away from the scoop due to the increase of the parallel flux needed to satisfy the Bohm-Chodura criterion. Qualitative agreement is obtained with measurements of the parallel <b>flow</b> near the <b>limiter</b> throat, and with measurements of the plenum pressure during negative biasing for both directions of toroidal magnetic field. The results, extrapolated to Tore Supra, predict that the actual design with throats should provide close to optimal pumping with minor modification of the natural radial electric field, but greater performance could be obtained with negative biasing if a toroidally symmetric neutralizer geometry were adopted...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a cold {{radiating}} plasma mantle might help {{to solve the problem}} of energy exhaust in a fusion reactor. Line radiation of impurities localized at the boundary of the bulk plasma could distribute the heating power onto the whole vessel wall and avoid dangerous heat loads at the plasma facing components as limiters or divertor plates. Important requirements have to be fulfilled within such a concept: on the one hand a stationary impurity concentration at the edge on a high level, sufficient to radiate a substantial fraction of the heating power and to reduce the plasma temperature at the boundary and the convective heat <b>flow</b> to the <b>limiters</b> or divertor plates, but on the other hand a limitation of the central impurity concentration to values compatible with ignition in a fusion reactor at the same time. First experiments at the tokamak TEXTOR with neon as the radiating impurity gave evidence for the feasibility of this concept. Within this work further experiments with neon and a comparison with silicon as the radiating impurity have been performed. The results are discussed with the help of model calculations to judge these two elements with respect to their suitability for radiation cooling by characterizing the mechanisms of their plasma wall interaction and the properties of radiation and transport.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new residual error estimator and adaptive algorithms based on the error estimator for steady and unsteady fluid flows in a finite volume framework. The aposteriori residual error estimator referred to as R [...] parameter, is a measure of the local truncation error and is derived from the imbalance arising from the use of an exact operator on the numerical solution for conservation laws. A detailed and systematic study of the R [...] parameter on linear and non [...] linear hyperbolic problems, involving continuous flows and discontinuities is performed. Simple theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments are performed to establish the fact that the R [...] parameter is a valid estimator at limiter [...] free continuous flow regions, but is rendered inconsistent at discontinuities and with limiting. The R [...] parameter is demonstrated to work equally well on different mesh topologies and detects the sources of error, making it an ideal choice to drive adaptive strategies. The theory of the error estimation is also extended for unsteady flows, both on static and moving meshes. The R [...] parameter can be computed with a low computational overhead and is easily incorporated into existing finite volume codes with minimal effort. Adaptive refinement algorithms for steady flows are devised employing the residual error estimator. For continuous <b>flows</b> devoid of <b>limiters,</b> a purely R [...] parameter based adaptive algorithm is designed. A threshold length scale derived from the estimator determines the refinement/derefinement criterion, leading to a self [...] evolving adaptive algorithm devoid of heuristic parameters. On the other hand, for compressible flows involving discontinuities and limiting, a hybrid adaptive algorithm is proposed. In this hybrid algorithm, error indicators are used to flag regions for refinement, while regions of derefinement are detected using the R [...] parameter. Two variants of these algorithms, which differ in the computation of the threshold length scale are proposed. The disparate behaviour of the R [...] parameter for continuous and discontinuous flows is exploited to design a simple and effective discontinuity detector for compressible flows. For time [...] dependent flow problems, a two [...] step methodology is proposed for adaptive grid refinement. In the first step, the ``best" mesh at any given time instant is determined. The second step involves predicting the evolution of flow phenomena over a period of time and refines regions into which the flow features would progress into. The latter step is implemented using a geometric [...] based ``Refinement Level Projection" strategy which guarantees that the flow features remain in adapted zones between successive adaptive cycles and hence uniform solution accuracy. Several numerical experiments involving inviscid and viscous flows on different grid topologies are performed to illustrate the success of the proposed adaptive algorithms. Appendix 1 Candidate's response to the comments/queries of the examiners The author would like to thank the reviewers for their appreciation of the work embodied in the thesis and for their comments. The clarifications to the comments and queries posed in the reviews are summarized below. Referee 1 Q: The example of mesh refinement for RANS solution with shock was performed with isotropic mesh, while the author claims that it is appropriate with anisotropic mesh. If this is the case, why did he not demonstrate that ? As the author knows well, in the case of full 3 [...] D configuration, isotropic adaptation will lead to substantial grid points. The large mesh will hamper timely turnaround time of simulation. Therefore it would be a significant contribution to the aero community if this point is investigated at a later date. Response: The author is of the view that for most practical situations, a pragmatic approach to mesh adaptation for RANS computations would merely involve generating a viscous padding of adequate fineness around the body and allowing for grid adaptation only in the outer potential region. Of course, this method would allow for grid adaptation in the outer layers of viscous padding only to the extent the smoothness criterion is satisfied while adapting the grids in the potential region. This completely obviates point addition to the wall (CAD surface) and there by avoids all complexities (like loss in automation) resulting from the interaction with the surface modeler while adding point on the wall. This method is expected to do well for attached flows and mildly separated flows. This method is expected to do well even for problems involving shock - boundary layer interaction, owing to the fact that the shock is normal to the wall surface (recall, a flow aligned grid is ideal to capture such shocks), as long as the interaction does not result in a massive separation. This approach has already been demonstrated in section 4. 5. 3 where in adaptive high-lift computations have been performed. Isotropic adaptation retains the goodness of the zero level grid and therefore the robustness of the solver does not suffer through successive levels of grid adaptation. This procedure may result in large number of volumes. On the other hand, the anisotropic refinement may result in significantly less number of volumes, but the mesh quality may have badly degenerated during successive levels of adaptation leading to difficulties in convergence. Therefore, the choice of either of these strategies is effectively dictated by requirements on grid quality and grid size. Also, it is generally understood that building tools for anisotropic adaptation are more complicated as compared to those required for isotropic adaptation, while anisotropic refinement may not require point addition on the wall. Considering these facts, in the view of the author, this issue is an open issue and his personal preference would be to use isotropic refinement or a hybrid strategy employing a combination of these methodologies, particularly considering aspects of solution quality. Finally, in both the examples cited by the reviewer (sections 6. 4. 5 & 6. 4. 6) the objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of the new adaptive algorithm (using error indicators and the residual estimator), rather than evaluating the pros & cons of isotropic and anisotropic refinement strategies. In the sections cited above, the author has merely highlighted the advantages of the refinement strategies in specific context of the problem considered and these statements need not be considered as general. Referee 2 Q: For convection problems, a good error estimator must be able to distinguish between locally generated error and convected error. The thesis says the residual error estimator is able to do this and some numerical evidence is presented, but can the candidate comment how the estimator is able to achieve this ? Response: The ultimate aim of any AMR strategy is to reduce the global error. The residual error estimator proposed in this work measures the local truncation error. It has been shown in the context of a linear convective equation that the global error in a cell consists of two parts [...] the locally generated error in the cell (which is the R [...] parameter) and the local error transported from other cells in the domain. Either of these errors are dependent on the local error itself and any algorithm that reduces the local truncation error (sources of error) will reduce the global error in the domain. This conclusion is supported by the test case of isentropic flow past an airfoil (Chapter 3, C, Pg 79), where refinement based on the R [...] parameter leads to lower global error levels than a global error based refinement itself. Q: While analysing the R [...] parameter in Section 3. 3, the operator δ 2 is missing. Response: The analysis in Section 3. 3 is based on Eq. (3. 3) (Pg 58) which provides the local truncation error. As can be seen from Eq. (3. 14), the LHS represents the discrete operator acting on the numerical solution (which is zero) and the first term on the RHS is the exact operator acting on the numerical solution (which is I[u]). Consequently the truncation terms T 1 and T 2 contribute to the truncation error R 1. However, from the viewpoint of computing the error estimate on a discretised domain, we need to replace the exact operator I by a higher order discrete operator δ 2. This gives the R-parameter, which has contributions from R 1 as well as discretisation errors due to the higher order operator, R 2. When the latter is negligible compared to the former, the R [...] parameter is an estimate of the local truncation error. The truncation error depends on the accuracy of the reconstruction procedure used in obtaining the numerical solution and hence on the discrete operator δ 1. On very similar lines, it can be shown that operator δ 2 leads to a formal second order accuracy and this operator is only required in computing the residual error estimate. Q: What does the phrase "exact derivatives of the numerical solution" mean ? Response: This statement exemplifies the fact that the numerical solution is the exact solution to the modified partial differential equation and that the truncation terms T 1 and T 2 that constitute the R [...] parameter are functions of the derivatives of this numerical solution. Q: For the operator δ 2 quadratic reconstruction is employed. Is the exact or numerical flux function used ? Response: The operator δ 2 is a higher order discrete approximation to the exact operator I. Therefore, a quadratic polynomial with a three [...] point Gauss quadrature has been used in the error estimation procedure. Error estimation does not involve issues with convergence associated with the flow solver and therefore an exact flux function has been employed with the δ 2 operator. Nevertheless, it is also possible to use the same numerical flux|$|R
