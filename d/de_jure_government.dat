25|$|Henceforth, the IRA Army Council {{perceived}} {{itself to}} be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. This allowed it to present its declaration of war on Britain in January 1939 (see S-Plan) as the act of a legitimate, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|This announcement, coming {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the S-Plan attacks, sought to present {{the actions of the}} IRA as those of a legitimate, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government.</b> Within this context, with the Army Council acting as government, with the right to use force and levy war against an occupying power, the IRA declared war on Britain in January 1939.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} word [...] "control" [...] in this list refers to control over the area occupied, not {{occupation}} of the area claimed. Unrecognized countries may have either full control over their occupied territory, or only partial control (such as Western Sahara). In the former, the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>governments</b> {{have little or no}} influence in the areas they claim to rule, whereas in the latter they have varying degrees of control, and may provide essential services to people living in the areas.|$|R
50|$|However, {{over the}} course of the war, {{effective}} power changed to the hands of Josip Broz Tito's Communist Partisans. In 1943, Tito proclaimed the creation of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (Demokratska federativna Jugoslavija). The Allies gradually recognized Tito's forces as the stronger opposition to the German occupation. They began to send most of their aid to Tito's Partisans, rather than to the Royalist Četniks. On 16 June 1944, the Tito-Šubašić agreement was signed, merging the de facto and the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>governments</b> of Yugoslavia.|$|R
50|$|The {{governments of}} Benito Mussolini's Italy and Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union {{recognised}} {{each other as}} <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>governments</b> of their respective countries and established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1924 (shortly {{after the death of}} Vladimir Lenin). A preliminary agreement had been made on 26 December 1921, de facto recognising the Soviet Union. The two states signed a Treaty on Friendship, Non-Aggression and Neutrality on 2 September 1933, which was in place until 22 June 1941 when Italy declared war on the Soviet Union as part of the Axis powers of World War II.|$|R

They support the Éire Nua policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments. RSF holds that the Irish Republic continues to exist and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the ongoing Syrian civil war, there are {{currently}} two governments claiming to be the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government</b> of Syria, using different flags to represent the state. The incumbent government, led by Bashar al-Assad and the Ba'ath Party, is using the red-white-black United Arab Republic flag in use since 1980; while the Syrian Interim Government, led by the Syrian National Coalition – seeking to overthrow the Assad government – readopted the green-white-black Independence flag in 2012.|$|E

Some of the achievements of the Provisional Government include the Battle of Chingshanli of 1920 and the ambush of Japanese Military Leadership in China in 1932. The Provisional Government is considered to be the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government</b> of the Korean people between 1919 and 1948.

2500|$|In September 1968, the Appellate Division of the Rhodesian High Court {{ruled that}} Ian Smith's {{administration}} {{had become the}} <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government</b> of the country, not merely the de facto one. To support his decision, Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle used several statements made by Hugo Grotius, who maintained {{that there was no}} way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory. Beadle argued that due to Britain's economic war against Rhodesia, she could not (at the same point) be described as governing Rhodesia. Resulting court decisions held that the rebel government [...] "could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done".|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} legal objections, the European Union (EU) in May 2013 gave the {{conditional}} green light {{for the transfer}} of arms to the Syrian Opposition Council. The EU's decision is not a solitary move. Several other States, including Russia, the United States, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have provided arms, funding and/or "non-lethal assistance" either to the Syrian government or to rebel forces combatting the Assad regime. The present contribution aims {{to shed light on}} the legality of such assistance. On the one hand, it assesses legal objections related to the fact that third-State assistance is used for the commission of widespread war crimes and human rights violations. On the other hand, it examines the compatibility of such assistance with the non-intervention principle and, in so doing, examines to what extent the latter principle discriminates between <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>governments</b> and non-State armed groups {{in the context of a}} civil war...|$|R

On both occasions, Poland used the international crises to address long-standing border disputes.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>Government</b> of Abkhazia in exile, {{then the}} Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, left Abkhazia after the Russian-backed Abkhaz separatist forces {{and their allies}} from the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus {{took control of the}} region’s capital Sokhumi after heavy {{fighting}} on 27 September 1993, leading to the mass killings of ethnic Georgians and loyal citizens, in which several members of the Abkhazian government, including its chairman Zhiuli Shartava, were executed by the rebels. The Council of Ministers relocated to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, where it operated as a <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>government</b> of Abkhazia for almost 13 years. During this period, the GAIE was led by Tamaz Nadareishvili, until President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili appointed a new chairman, Irakli Alasania, his envoy in the peace talks over Abkhazia.|$|E

5000|$|These changes included: {{changing}} {{the structure of}} the state from a federal, or Majimbo system, to a unitary system; creating a unicameral instead of bicameral legislature; changing from a parliamentary to a semi-presidential system with a powerful presidency; and reducing the protections of the bill of rights.

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of nonpartisan governments - de facto and <b>de</b> <b>jure.</b> <b>De</b> facto nonpartisan <b>governments</b> are ones where no laws prevent the {{formation}} of political parties, but no parties exist. Most of the de facto nonpartisan governments represent very small populations, such as in Niue, Tuvalu, and Palau. On the other hand, governments that outlaw political parties but do have elections are <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> nonpartisan systems. Several <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> nonpartisan national <b>governments</b> are Persian Gulf states, such as Oman and Kuwait. The legislatures in these Gulf state nonpartisan governments typically have advisory capacity only (i.e. - They may comment on laws proposed by the executive branch, but are unable to create real laws themselves.), but are partially or entirely elected by citizens.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1973, asserting an {{exclusive}} mandate {{for all of}} Germany was an officially strictly observed policy. Under the Hallstein Doctrine, the Federal Republic broke diplomatic relations with states that maintained diplomatic relations with the GDR, except for the Soviet Union. On different levels, such as in international sports, there were, however, {{a wide range of}} international cooperations which even led to unified German teams in six Olympic Games. [...] Over time, especially after the election of a social-liberal coalition led by Willy Brandt in 1969, the exclusive mandate was softened, as it severely limited the Federal Republic's domestic and international autonomy. Starting in 1973, the Federal Republic took the line that the Democratic Republic was a de facto government within a single German nation, in respect of which the Federal Republic was the sole representative <b>de</b> <b>jure,</b> but limited to its own territorial extent; hence relinquishing any claim to be <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> the <b>government</b> of Germany as a whole.|$|R
