[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 MİMARLIKTA EKOSİSTEM DÜŞÜNCESİYLE TASARLAMAK ÖZET Doğa, insan ve diğer canlı türleri arasındaki etkileşim mimarlık bağlamında ele alındığında iki önemli sorunsalın varlığından söz edilebilir. Tezde amaçlanan, doğa deneyimi ve biyoçeşitliliğin azalması olarak tanımlanan bu iki soruna çözüm üretebilmek amacıyla bir tartışma ortamı yaratabilmektir. Bu anlamda, tez genel olarak insan ve doğa arasındaki ilişkiyi tekrar güçlendirmek adına ortaya çıkan doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımlarını ve canlıların çevresiyle olan ilişkilerini inceleyen ekoloji bilimini konu alır. Çalışma kapsamında ele alınan kavramlar üzerinden ekosistem düşüncesi, tasarım sürecini yönlendiren önemli bir farkındalık, bilinç düzeyi olarak kabul eden ekosistem temelli öneri bir tasarım modeli ortaya koymaktadır. Tezin ilk bölümünde, ekolojinin alt dalları etki alanlarına göre ölçeklendirilmiş ve işleyiş fonksiyonlarına göre analiz edilmiştir. Ekoloji dallarının içerdiği kavramlar ekosistem süzgecinden geçirilerek yeniden değerlendirilmiş ve doğa temelli tasarım anlayışlarının daha iyi kavranmasını sağlayacak ekolojik bir rehber oluşturulmuştur. Tezin ikinci bölümünde ise, oluşturulan ekolojik rehber üzerinden mevcut doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımlarının ekoloji dalları ile etkileşim seviyeleri araştırılmış, güçlü ve zayıf yönleri ortaya konulmaya çalışılmıştır. Ekosistem temelli yeni bir tasarım yaklaşımı için, ekosistem ve barındırdığı biyoçeşitliliğin tasarım kriteri olarak mekan biçimleme sürecinde ele alınması gerektiğini ve insanın doğanın ayrılmaz bir parçası olduğunu vurgulayan ekoloji dalları ile doğa temelli tasarım yaklaşımları temel alınarak içerik oluşturulmuştur. Son bölüm ekosistem temelli bir tasarım yaklaşımı için önerilen üç aşamalı bir modeli ortaya koymaktadır. Modelin ilk basamağı mekan hissi, kendi kendine yetebilme, mutualist yaşam ve devamlılık kavramlarından oluşan ekosistem gereksinimlerini ele almakta, ikinci basamağı gereksinimleri yerine getiren deneyim, denge, döngü ve organizasyon kriterlerini tanımlamaktadır. Üçüncü basamak ise modelin yaratıcı bir süreç olarak derinliğini arttırmak ve tasarımda, araştırmacı, yenilikçi, özgün düşünceler oluşmasını sağlamak üzere ekolojik değer, ekolojik süreç, ekolojik koşul ve ekolojik strateji kavramlarını içeren ekolojik değişkenleri tartışmaktadır. Örnek projeler üzerinden açıklanan kavramlar kendi başlarına yeni bir görüş içermeseler de model içerisinde ele alınış ve ilişkilendiriliş biçimleriyle mevcut yaklaşımlar arasında yeni bir perspektif ortaya koymaktadır. Tez bu anlamda ekosistem temelli tasarım anlayışının özüne dair öneri bir model sunmanın yanı sıra gelecekte mimarlığın ekosisteme nasıl dahil olabileceğine dair öngörüler barındırmaktadır. Böylelikle mimari çalışmaların içerisine ekosistemi temel alan ekolojik bir sorumluluk yerleştirmek hedeflenmiştir. DESIGNING WITH THE REFLECTION OF ECOSYSTEM IN ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY When the {{interaction}} between nature, humanbeings and the other living species is considered in an architectural context, two major problems can be seen. In this thesis, it is aimed to generate a discussion medium regarding to these two problems which {{can be defined as}} the loss of nature experience and the biodiversity. In this respect, this thesis is subjected on the nature based design approaches which are emerged as a basis to re-establish the relationship between nature and the humanbeings and the science of ecology that researches the relationships among living species and inbetween the nature as a basis to offer logical solutions to the loss of biodiversity. An ecosystem based design proposal which considers the idea of an ecosystem that is developed through the concepts which are undertaken in the scope of this study as an awareness and the degree of conciousness that influences the design process is put forth for consideration. In the first section of the thesis, the branches of ecology is scaled regarding to their effective domain and is analysed according to their operational functions. The concepts included in these branches of ecology is re-considered in respect to the ecosystems and in this way, an <b>ecological</b> <b>guide</b> is developed that would help to understand the nature based design approaches better. These ecological branches can be scaled as the city and human ecology, landscape ecology, industrial ecology and ecosystem ecology. In this section of the thesis {{it can be seen that}} by using the city and human ecology, landscape ecology and industrial ecology as components and restoration ecology as a tool, an <b>ecological</b> <b>guide</b> can be developed as all the major keywords that define each of these ecological branches can be comprehended by the ecosystem ecology and its keywords. This implies the fact that whether it is obvious or not, every action that takes place in each of these ecological branches will end up affecting ecosystem ecology and the <b>ecological</b> <b>guide</b> helps us to better understand these interactions. In the second section, the integration degree between the nature based design approaches and the branches of ecology is studied through the developed <b>ecological</b> <b>guide,</b> the strength and the weakness of each approach is aimed to be displayed. <b>Ecological</b> <b>guide</b> is used as a criteria to reveal the weakness of a nature based design approach and this weakness is then used as a requirement to develop a new and expansive analyses period through the existing nature based design approaches. Green design can be seen as an approach to minimize the harmful effects of an industrial process to the environment and human health and is supported by the existing assessment methods, but despite the fact that it contibutes positive insights about energy efficiency and resource management it has no potential rather than the minimization of the existing impact. Ecological design on the other hand is an environmentally concious design approach that handles the nature and the built environment together as a whole but the way it treats the requirements only from the human perspective, it does not contribute a meaningful ecosystem based approach. These two approaches both show concern for the physical and material based necessities while biophilic design considers the psychological affects of the nature experience but lacks an attitude towards ecosystems. Biomimicry is regarded as a design approach which analyses and is inspired by the natural processes and rather than the other approaches it respects nature and regards it as a mentor. It shows a good opportunity with its ecosystem level biomimicry field but has not fully revealed yet. Regenerative design on the other hand is based on the system theory and has its roots in process based regeneration of ecosystems but lacks the potential solutions for {{the interaction}} between humans and the other living organisms. It is seen that every approach has some potential to fulfill and some waknesses to overcome. While biomimicry offers an inspiring field of discovery and can be considered encouraging, the most satisfactory approach among them can be regarded as the discipline of regenerative design with respect to an ecosystem based design approach. As an outcome of these analyses, the content for a new ecosystem based design approach is developed regarding the nature based design approaches and the branches of ecology that emphasizes the need to treat the ecosystem and the biodiversity it contains as a design criteria and that the humans are an integral part of the ecosystem. The last section of the thesis reveals an ecosystem based design model that encourages solutions for the lack of nature experience and biodiversity. The model is based on three sublevels. The first level is composed of valuable concepts that are extracted from the ecological branches and the nature based design approaches. The first level of the model defines and discusses the ecosystem necessities which are consisting of sense of place, self sufficiency, mutual relationships and continuity while the second level illustrates the criterias that fulfill the necessities such as experience, stability, cycle and organisation that fulfill the necessities. Third level argues the ecological variables that would generate inquiring and original thoughts in design and deepen the model as a creative process as they influence the criterias to fulfill the necessities and includes the concepst such as ecological value, ecological process, ecological conditions and ecological strategy. Ecological values examines whether the design is driven by biospheric values, ecological process searches how well the design provides opportunities for the native ecosystem cycles, ecological conditions care for the attitude towards the habitats of other living organisms and ecological strategy investigates the success degree of integrations between the built environment and the local ecosystem structure. The proposed model demonstrates the ways of implementations through the analyses of comtemporary design examples which can be regarded as visionary projects that respect the native ecosystems. Each sublevel of the model is discussed through the appropriate design examples to better explain the way to treat these keywords defined in the model and how they can become a tool to put forth a manifestation in the domains of ecosystem ecology and architecture. The concepts that are defined through project examples may not seem to have unique meanings on their own but the way they are associated in the model reveals a new perspective. This thesis therefore not only proposes a new ecosystem based design model, but also provides foresights on how architecture can be integrated to the local ecosystems in the future. Thus it is aimed to establish an ecological responsibility in the architectural studies. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|Hawaiian spinner {{dolphins}} (Stenella longirostris longirostris) rest {{in shallow}} bays off the Kona Coast of Hawai‘i Island. Tourism operations exploit this behavior, placing tourists {{into the water}} to swim, kayak, and paddleboard with the dolphins, often harassing them. These activities disrupt resting behavior and may lead to negative population level effects. Several strategies to protect the dolphins have been attempted in previous years. None however, have proven successful. Here, I illustrate {{the need for an}} outreach campaign to educate tourists visiting Hawai‘i. I have created a mobile application: The Nai‘a Guide. This application (app) serves as an <b>ecological</b> conscience <b>guide</b> to spinner dolphin tourism. It provides tourists with information, maps, photos, audio, and video explaining the dolphins’ ecology and the science of spinner dolphin research. The app offers direct connections to accredited tourism operations that adhere to a code of responsible practices recognized by the Dolphin SMART program. With funding provided by Dolphin SMART, I was able to work with an online company, Kleverbeast, to design and create the app and release The Nai‘a Guide on Apple’s iTunes App Store. To illustrate the potential of such a tool, I used an educational video accompanied by surveys to measure the change in perception of the consequences of human interaction with the dolphins. My findings indicate that multimedia tools on mobile devices have power for changing awareness and therefore changing action. I also explored the need for further development in mobile technology for conservation initiatives through a survey of apps that are currently available for download. The results shown here indicate that multimedia apps like The Nai‘a Guide are a viable but largely underused tool for increased conservation awareness. Future work should include the continued development of updated content, transforming The Nai‘a Guide for use on multiple mobile platforms, advertising, monitoring the app’s downloads, and assessing the app’s success, as well as the consideration of additional conservation initiatives that may benefit from mobile <b>ecological</b> conscience <b>guides...</b>|$|R

Enaruvbe and Atafo noted that locals’ perceptions of economic opportunity and increased demand for <b>ecological</b> services <b>guided</b> increased deforestation patterns. Researcher Mark Anikpo reported rural population pressures which combine unsustainable population growth with intensified rates of destitution and an absence of income alternatives as a primary cause of mangrove resource reliance by local communities. A 1998 study conducted by Ogbuigwe suggested that these rural communities derived 90 percent of their household energy from firewood (which includes mangrove wood). Local fishing practices have also served as an indirect threat to deforestation and loss of fertility amongst mangrove populations. Local fishers who use mangrove wood and bark to carve canoes, craft nets, and fashion tools also have historically used dynamite to yield a larger catch of fish. However, utilizing this chemical explosive tactic has led to riverbank vegetation infertility.|$|R

This chapter presents an overview of remaining key knowledge gaps, consequent future research directions and their significance for management and planning for wind energy generation. The impacts of wind farms on wildlife are generally site-, species- and season-specific and related management strategies and practices may differ considerably between countries. These differences acknowledge the need to consider potential wildlife impacts for each wind farm project. Still, the <b>ecological</b> mechanisms <b>guiding</b> species’ responses and potential vulnerability to wind farms can be expected to be fundamental in nature. A more cohesive understanding of the causes, patterns, mechanisms, and consequences of animal movement decisions will thereby facilitate successful mitigation of impacts. This requires planning approaches that implement the mitigation hierarchy effectively to reduce risks to species of concern. At larger geographical scales, population-level and cumulative impacts of multiple wind farms (and other anthropogenic activity) need to be addressed. This requires longitudinal and multiple-site studies to identify species-specific traits that influence risk of mortality, notably from collision with wind turbines, disturbance or barrier effects. In addition, appropriate pre- and post-construction monitoring techniques must be utilized.

This article illustrates {{the use of}} ethnographic research to enhance understanding of students 2 ̆ 7 cultural experiences and facilitate the development of culturally specific interventions. Ethnographic data were collected during formative and intervention phases of a school-based mental health promotion project. Data were coded using an interactive deductive–inductive process. Culture specificity {{was defined as the}} integration of etic (universal) and emic (culture-bound) perspectives. Four culture-specific themes were identified: adult-sanctioned behaviors and practices, adolescents 2 ̆ 7 perspectives about the present and aspirations for the future, and societal factors. These themes encompassed code categories reflecting cultural attitudes, beliefs, customs, expectations, norms, and values; and reflected the <b>ecological</b> framework that <b>guided</b> the research.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityResearchers have studied the primary determinants of physical activity {{in an effort to}} enhance health promotion initiatives nationwide. These physical activity determinants have been observed to differ among various segments of the population, suggesting a further examination of physical activity barriers among differing populations. Little research has been conducted to analyze differences in determinants between university students reporting varying levels of physical activity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association between gender and perception of physical activity barriers and overall physical activity level among university students. An <b>ecological</b> model <b>guided</b> a literature review where it was revealed that individual, interpersonal, and environmental barriers demonstrated to influence activity participation for college students. The study was a cross-sectional e-survey analysis of a stratified random sampling of 412 university students, where perceived barriers were measured using the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale and physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Logistic regression revealed that being male was significantly associated with being highly physically active (OR = 2. 56, p=. 0003). Additionally, perceptions of physical activity barriers were negatively associated to being highly physically active (OR = 0. 92, p= 0. 0001) for both genders. The findings of this study will contribute to positive social change by providing additional knowledge regarding determinants of activity among university students, and by augmenting policy development regarding general education physical activity/fitness and educational requirements as part of the university curriculum...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} titled ”It’s {{in their hands}} ” {{in order to show}} the {{responsibility}} various stakeholders have both in causing intimate partner violence (IPV) and its perpetuation as well as their importance for prevention efforts. IPV is a global issue affecting millions of women worldwide. The aim of this case study was to explore the causes of physical and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 key informants including partnered men and women, NGO representatives, researchers, government officials, religious leaders, policemen, and a hospital owner. Secondary data was collected from policy documents and NGO reports. An <b>ecological</b> model <b>guided</b> data collection and analysis, which sees violence as stemming from individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Individual level factors related to IPV were witnessing marital violence as a child and substance abuse. Relationship level factors were male decision-making power, marital conflict, jealousy, infidelity and barriers to leaving. Community level factors were unemployment and isolation of the woman and family. Societal level factors were rigid gender roles, notions of masculinity linked to dominance, a sense of ownership of women, violence being condoned, acceptance of physical chastisement of women, lack of knowledge of laws and IPV not being a political priority. The findings of this study point to the need of multi-sectoral approaches in prevention efforts. It’s in the hands of all the stakeholders to prevent intimate partner violence in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT 	Physical {{inactivity}} {{and substance}} use are major concerns in adolescents. Limited research examines the possible link between physical activity (PA) {{and substance use}}. These studies explored the relationship of PA to risk and protective factors and health risk and promotion behaviors in adolescents. An <b>Ecological</b> Model <b>guided</b> this research. Data from the Monitoring the Future were analyzed by multiple regression and SEM. Differences by gender, ethnicity, and PA level were examined. 	The model explained {{a small amount of}} the variance in PA (R 2 =. 11). The strongest predictors of PA in both 8 th and 10 th grades were religious identity (8 th Β=. 122, 10 th B=. 096, p<. 001) and academic performance (8 th Β =. 177, 10 th Β =. 156, p<. 001). The model explained more of the variance in tobacco use (R 2 =. 169 -. 228) and alcohol use (R 2 = 264 -. 357). Attitude toward alcohol (8 th B=-. 115, 10 th B=-. 225), perception of alcohol risk (8 th B=-. 170, 10 th B=-. 163), and academic performance (8 th B=-. 162, 10 th B=-. 149) were the strongest predictors of alcohol use while academic performance was the strongest predictor of tobacco use (8 th B=-. 159, 10 th B=-. 150). PA only statistically moderated the effects of school attachment on tobacco use and television hours on alcohol use (p<. 001), however differences were observed between PA groups. The model explained more of the variance in tobacco use (R 2 =. 239 -. 255) for the sedentary group than the high PA group (R 2 =. 187 -. 217). The model explained less of the variance in alcohol use in the sedentary group (R 2 =. 258 -. 313) than the high PA group (R 2 =. 343 -. 380). PA had a direct negative effect on tobacco use (10 th female B=-. 115, p<. 001) and direct positive effect on alcohol use (10 th male B=. 096, 10 th female B=. 133, p<. 001). Significant predictors of PA remained the same between 1992, 1999, and 2004. Boys consistently reported more PA than girls and minorities reported less PA than Caucasians. Individual and school variables {{play a significant role in}} PA, tobacco use, and alcohol use. The Ecologic Model explained a small to moderate amount of the variance in adolescent behavior. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the potential use of an <b>Ecological</b> Model to <b>guide</b> nursing practice and interventions aimed at modifying behavior in adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coordinating the {{relationship}} between economic development and ecological protection, a series of complex tests {{have been given to}} many governments，especialy in ecotone. taking Dalate County for example, the ecological characteristics and the situation economic development are evaluated by an improved ecological footprint model, which is based on emergy analysis theory and ecosystem service function model. The calculating results indicate that the ecological footprint of Dalate County is 3. 9 × 106 hm 2 in total annualy, the actual output ecological capacity is 2. 04 × 106 hm 2. There is a huge gap between ecological footprint and ecological capacity. The total ecosystem services value is 1. 01 × 1010 CNY·a. And among all types land, woodland contributes the greatest, which is 4. 19 × 109 CNY·a. Among all kinds service, regulation service take the largest proportion, which value is 5. 53 × 109 CNY·a. Those results can be used to <b>guide</b> <b>ecological</b> protection and economic development in ecotones, like Dalate County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A rapid {{increase}} in mountain biking partici-pation over {{the past thirty years}} has led to concerns about ecological impacts to recreation environments, especially trails. It is widely accepted that recreational use of natural areas inevitably results in some degree of change to resource conditions, and managers must consider the social acceptability and ecological significance of such changes in their decision making. The ecological impacts of mountain biking, however, and rela-tionships between impacts and trail features remain poorly understood. This study uses Common Ecological Regions (CERs) as a mapped <b>ecological</b> framework to <b>guide</b> comparative analysis of differences in maximum trail incision and trail width at varying slope levels for mountain bike trails in five CERs in the southwest U. S. A point-measurement trail assessment procedure was utilized to measure maximum incision and width for 163. 2 miles of mountain bike trails. Results show a significant effect of CER on trail width and maximum incision and a significant effec...|$|R
