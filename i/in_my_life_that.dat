[...] Curtin's leadership {{on the road to}} the final helped convince the players, fans, media, and front office of his ability to manage the club.

His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E

Winslet missed the premiere of Titanic to attend his funeral, and described the experience of losing him as [...] "unbelievably heartbreaking". In a 2008 interview, she said that she never got over his death. A year after Treadre's death, Winslet met Jim Threapleton on the set of Hideous Kinky, in which he was an assistant director.

500|$|The Shins {{were not}} truly a band when James Mercer {{composed}} the song, {{and the idea}} of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>that</b> sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line [...] "Gold teeth and a curse for this town" [...] refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.|$|E
500|$|... "Teeth" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Taja Riley, Pete Wyoming Bender, and Teddy Riley, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Teddy Riley. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't want no money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I think that for a long time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> I replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices.

[...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me."
