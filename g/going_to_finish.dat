25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E

He's going to leave. You know, in a couple of years' time when his contract is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout.

2500|$|One viewer {{along with}} Newcomb were more bothered by other things {{they had seen}} on the soap opera. They cited that a 14-year-old boy shot {{a man who was}} attacking his mother in 2008, and that [...] "one {{character}} was so desperate for a baby that she slept with her ex-brother-in-law and was nearly caught having sex in an elevator. Another woman, they said, led her children and ex-husband into believing she had a brain tumor just to get him back". They felt that these incidents within the series were more offensive than two men kissing, and that the show should not have gone through with the Luke and Noah storyline if they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> it.|$|E

The unreleased material is [...] "some really out-there stuff, which hopefully will {{see the light of day}} at some point". Among these is a song Gorillaz wanted to record with Engelbert Humperdinck. [...] "He was supposed to do it, but then he declined, which was a real shame", Albarn explained to New York magazine. [...] "It's a very dramatic song, very moving. Arabic strings. It's imagining Earth losing its gravitational pull and starting to fall". As it turned out, Humperdinck's manager had listened to the proposed selection and declined the offer for him without his knowing. Humperdinck later stated in an interview that his manager declining the collaboration offer was [...] "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz if he had known they asked. With or without Humperdinck, Albarn insists the tune will eventually be released. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> that off", he said. [...] "It just needs the vocal. We've made contact with Indian singer Asha Bhosle and I think it's definitely going to happen. I'll maybe duet with her; the song has these answering phrases".
