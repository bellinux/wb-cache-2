Design/methodology/approach – To measure these concepts, scales are developed for a questionnaire by drawing on measures established in the organizational behavior literature and adapting these to <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor's</b> context. <b>The</b> questionnaire is sent to a sample of <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> drawn from <b>the</b> database of <b>the</b> Institute of <b>Internal</b> <b>Auditors</b> Malaysia in which listed companies with an in-house internal audit function are extracted. There are 101 useable responses. Findings – The results reveal that both role ambiguity and role conflict are significantly negatively related to commitment to independence. The underlying dimensions found to have the greatest impact on commitment to independence are: first, ambiguity in both the exercise of authority by <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor</b> and time pressure faced by <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> auditor; and second, conflict between <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor's</b> personal values and both management's and their profession's expectations and requirements.

40|$|A {{critical}} role of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor</b> is {{to design and}} monitor their organization's system of internal controls (COSO, 2004). In addition, they {{may be expected to}} objectively assess <b>the</b> quality of <b>internal</b> controls as professional auditors (Gray, 2004). External auditors have expressed concern that an <b>internal</b> <b>auditor’s</b> strong identity with their organization will bias any internal control assessments he or she makes of that organization (Schneider, 1984). Even so, accounting regulators believe internal auditors’ internal control assessments can be objective, and also maintain that having external auditors rely on these assessments should help to lower audit fees without jeopardizing audit quality (AICPA, 1990 - AS 5). Through two separate experiments, relying on social identity theory, social norms and the organizational silence literature in psychology, I examine whether the “employee” identity <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor</b> assumes {{as a member of the}} organization encourages other employees to share more information about internal control weaknesses with <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor</b> than <b>the</b> external auditor. In addition, I explore conditions under which the external auditor may be willing to rely on <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor’s</b> <b>internal</b> control assessment even if <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor’s</b> organizational identity is strong. Overall, this research will help external auditors, managers and regulators understand conditions under which <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>auditor</b> can maintain their objectivity when performing an internal control assessment.

Using a 2 x 2 between-participants experiment, the current study manipulates the use of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> audit function as a management training ground (used as a training ground vs. not used as a training ground) and fraud magnitude (large fraud, defined as 30 percent of net income vs. small fraud, defined as one percent of net income).
