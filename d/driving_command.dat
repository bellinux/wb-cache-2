50|$|The <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> {{system used}} short {{sections}} of the running rails, 10 ft long, which were called 'spots', and carried signals coded at between 1 kHz and 20 kHz. Running speeds were coded so that 100 Hz represented 1 mph, so a 3.5 kHz spot indicated that the train should be travelling at 35 mph and a 2 kHz spot {{that it should be}} travelling at 20 mph. In addition, a 15 kHz spot indicated that the traction motors should be shut down, but the train allowed to coast, while a 20 kHz spot indicated that the train should stop, as the next signal was at danger. When a train passed a speed control spot on the approach to a station, the brakes were applied at different rates, depending on whether the train was travelling faster or slower than the specified speed. Once the speed was below 4 mph, the brakes were released slightly, to ensure a smooth stop, and the resting position would be within 5 ft of the desired stop point.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} {{automatic}} train operation developed for the Victoria line, and hence the 1967 Stock, used two types of coded signals, which were fed into the running rails, and pickup up by two independent sets of coils on the train. The first was the safety signalling system, which used a continuous signal encoded at 125 Hz. This was used to pass codes at 420, 270 or 180 pulses per minute (ppm) to the control circuits. Failure to receive any of these codes resulted in the emergency brake operating. 180 ppm allowed the train to operate at speeds up to 25 mph but did not allow power to be applied if it had previously been shut off. 270 ppm allowed the train to operate up to the same speed, but power could also be re-applied if it had previously been shut off. Finally, 420 ppm allowed the train to run at the speeds set by the <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> system, which was {{the second of the}} two coded message systems.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of a}} servoactuator and of a four-port proportional direction control valve has been developed. Mechanical and hydraulic elements have been simulated in the LMS Amesim environment. The complete model has been validated {{on the basis of}} the experimental time histories of the actuator velocity and of the flow-rate controlled by the proportional valve. The validation data have been acquired on a fluid power system used to test electro-hydraulic servovalves according to ISO 10770 - 1 standard. The measurement of the instantaneous flow-rate through the valve has been performed with an innovative high-dynamics flowmeter, recently developed for high-pressure liquid flows. Furthermore, the model predicted static characteristic of the proportional valve has been compared with a corresponding experimentally derived curve and an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships has been carried out for the valve static performance. Measured data on valve leakages have also been presented in order to complete the steadystate characterization of the tested valve. The developed model of the hydraulic system has been then applied to realize the Bode diagram of the proportional valve, which is expressed in terms of instantaneous flow-rate as a function of the sinusoidal <b>driving</b> <b>command,</b> as well as the Bode diagram of the subsystem made up of the proportional valve and of the linear actuator. The latter Bode graph is plotted in terms of piston velocity as a function of the sinusoidal <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> provided to the valve. The comparison between the two Bode diagrams has confirmed the accuracy of the ISO procedure, which is based on the assumption of negligible delay introduced by the dynamic response of the servoactuator and by the oil compressibility.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel continuous-time dynamic average consensus algorithm for networks whose interaction {{is described by}} a strongly connected and weight-balanced directed graph. The proposed distributed algorithm allows agents to track the average of their dynamic inputs with some steady-state error whose size can be controlled using a design parameter. This steady-state error vanishes for special classes of input signals. We analyze the asymptotic correctness of the algorithm under time-varying interaction topologies and characterize the requirements on the stepsize for discrete-time implementations. We show that our algorithm naturally preserves {{the privacy of the}} local input of each agent. Building on this analysis, we synthesize an extension of the algorithm that allows individual agents to control their own rate of convergence towards agreement and handle saturation bounds on the <b>driving</b> <b>command.</b> Finally, we show that the proposed extension additionally preserves the privacy of the transient response of the agreement states and the final agreement value from internal and external adversaries.

This system provides evidence of the feasibility of brain signals being a viable approach to controlling the chosen prosthetic. Results are then presented in the second framework. This latter one allowed for the training and classification of EEG signals for motor imagery tasks. When analysing the system, clear visual representations of the performance and accuracy are presented in the results using a confusion matrix, accuracy measurement and a feedback bar signifying signal strength. Experiments with various acquisition datasets were carried out and with a critical evaluation of the results given.

40|$|A signal {{processing}} technique {{has been developed}} to dramatically increase both the usable bandwidth and tracking accuracy of an actuator. Traditional feedback controller design makes little or no use of the information content of the <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> signal. Feedforward and look-ahead schemes use a small sliding window of trajectory data to improve tracking performance and to reduce the overshoot of an accelerated axis. If the entire command signal for each axis of a machine is generated off-line, and the dynamic response of each axis is well characterized, then a new command signal can be derived which will drive the axes to follow the correct motion path. This idea is related to reference feedforward control, but by considering the complete command signal a priori, performance of the overall machine tool is greatly enhanced. An inverse dynamics algorithm has been developed that modifies a motion path using an actuator's impulse response to produce a new command signal that counteracts actuator dynamics, yielding {{a significant reduction in}} steady-state tracking error. This technique critically depends on knowledge of the actuator dynamics and does not replace the feedback controller. Rather it improves the response of an actuator by compensating for high frequency dynamics that the servo feedback loop cannot correct due to saturation of the drive system.

This is especially important on high speed lines, in expansion in many countries, given that very high levels of consumption are involved. Energy saving strategies focused on traffic operation can be applied in the short term with low levels of investment, in particular ecodriving, timetable design and the on line regulation of trains. However approaches in the literature to minimize energy do not normally consider specific models for manual driving in high speed lines and the commercial punctuality constraints of this type of services, and do {{not take into account the}} uncertainty associated with manual driving. The aim of this paper is the on line regulation of high speed trains recalculating the energy efficient manual driving to be executed by the driver when significant delays arise. The manual driving is modeled by means of fuzzy parameters: the speed regulation and the response time of the driver when a new <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> has to be applied. The punctuality requirement of the railway operator is represented as a necessity fuzzy measure of punctual arrival at stations. The proposed method for the on line recalculation of efficient driving is a Genetic Algorithm with fuzzy parameters based on an accurate simulation of the train motion. This algorithm is applied on a real Spanish high speed line to assess the energy savings provided by the efficient regulation algorithm compared to the typical driving style that is applied when a train has to get back on schedule after a delay. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} reduction {{is one of}} the priorities of metro operators, due to financial cost and environmental impact. The new signalling system Communications- Based Train Control (CBTC) is being installed in new and upgraded metro lines to increase transportation capacity. But its continuous communication feature also permits to improve the energy performance of traffic operation, by updating the control command of the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system at any point of the route. The present research addresses two main topics. The first is the design of efficient CBTC speed profiles for undisturbed train trajectory between two stations. The second takes into account the interaction between two consecutive trains under abnormal traffic conditions and proposes a tracking algorithm to save energy. In {{the first part of the}} research an off-line methodology to design optimal speed profiles for CBTC-ATO controlled trains is proposed. The methodology is based on a new multi-objective optimisation algorithm named NSGA-II-F, which is used to design speed profiles in such a way that can cover all the possible efficient solutions in a pseudo-Pareto front. The pseudo–Pareto front is built by using dominated solutions to make available a complete set of feasible situations in a driving scenario. The uncertainty in the passenger load is modelled as a fuzzy parameter. Each of the resulting speed profiles is obtained as a set of parameters that can be sent to the ATO equipment to perform the driving during the operation. The proposed optimisation algorithm makes use of detailed simulation of the train motion. Therefore, a simulator of the train motion has been developed, including detailed model of the specific ATO equipment, the ATP constraints, the traction equipment, the train dynamics and the track. A subsequent analysis considers the effect in the design of considering the regenerative energy flow between the train and the surrounding railway system. The second part of the research is focused on the proposal and validation of a fuzzy tracking algorithm for controlling the motion of two consecutive trains during disturbed conditions. A disturbed condition is understood as a change in the nominal <b>driving</b> <b>command</b> of a leading train and its consequences in the subsequent trains. When a train runs close enough to the preceding one, a tracking algorithm is triggered to control the distance between both trains. The following train receives the LMA (limit of movement authority) via radio, which is updated periodically as the preceding train runs. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to take actions in such a way that the following train could track the leading train meeting the safety requirements and applying an energy saving driving technique (coasting command). The uncertainty in the variations of the speed of the preceding train is modelled as a fuzzy quantity. The proposed algorithm is based on the application of coasting commands when possible, substituting traction/braking cycles by traction/coasting cycles, and hence saving energy. Both algorithms were tested and validated by using a detailed simulation program. The NSGA-II-F algorithm provided additional energy savings when compared to fixedblock distance-to-go configurations, and giving a more even distribution of the solutions. The fuzzy tracking algorithm provides energy savings with a minor impact on running times while improving comfort, because of the reduction of the inefficient traction/braking cycles.
