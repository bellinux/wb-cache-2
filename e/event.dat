40|$|There is {{evidence}} that daily negative <b>events</b> at work enhance fatigue. In contrast, positive <b>events</b> may trigger processes that increase, but also processes that decrease, energetic resources. Accordingly, results regarding a main effect of positive <b>events</b> on fatigue have been mixed. However, a clearer pattern between positive <b>events</b> and fatigue can be expected under adverse circumstances (i. e., accumulation of negative <b>events,</b> high chronic stressors). Positive <b>events</b> may facilitate coping and accelerate recovery processes and, thus, reduce resource drain due to daily negative <b>events</b> and chronic stressors. Predicting fatigue in a diary study with 76 employees, we investigated interactions between daily positive <b>events</b> and (a) daily negative <b>events</b> and (b) chronic social stressors. Multilevel modeling revealed that negative but not positive <b>events</b> were associated with increased end-of-work fatigue. However, positive <b>events</b> interacted with negative <b>events</b> and with chronic social stressors. As expected, positive <b>events</b> were negatively associated with fatigue only on days with many negative <b>events,</b> but not so on days with few negative <b>events.</b> Analogously, positive <b>events</b> were negatively associated with fatigue only among employees with high, compared with low, chronic social stressors. We conclude that the beneficial short-term effects of positive <b>events</b> on energetic resources are largely confined to adverse circumstances...|$|R
