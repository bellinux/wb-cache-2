40|$|The {{preliminary}} design af a high altitude, remotely piloted, atmospheric sampling aircraft powered by microwave energy beamed from a ground based antenna has been completed. The aircraft utilizes a horizontal tail and a canard for longitudinal control {{and to enhance}} the structural rigidity of the twin fuselage configuration.

Therefore, a structural load alleviation system is proposed to limit actual loads to the designed structural limit. Since the transmitting antenna would have a diameter of several hundred feet, {{it would not be}} readily transportable; so, it is proposed that a single antenna be constructed at a site from which the aircraft is to be flown.

The prediction of an aerospace structure's response to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> is largely dependent on empirical databases created from collections of development and flight test data. While there is significant structural response data due to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> for metallic structures, there is much less data available for composite structures.

40|$|Introduction: Helicopter pilots {{complain}} of pain originating {{from the neck}} region. The causes are still basically unknown, but the ergonomic situation when flying a helicopter, with unfavorable load caused by static neck and body positions, whole-body vibration and heavy head-worn equipment, has been suggested as a risk factor. Aim: The aim of the work reported in this thesis was to quantify the effects of external loads on helicopter pilots necks, and to evaluate different methods for measuring neck load. Methods: Thirty-nine Swedish military helicopter pilots participated in the five studies. The effects of different neck and body positions, head-worn equipment and vertical whole-body vibration were evaluated concerning neck muscle activity, induced mechanical load and seat-to-head transmissibility. Surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from upper and lower dorsal neck muscles, the sternocleidomastoid, and the upper trapezius. The <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> on the lower cervical spine was calculated using a sagittal, static, biomechanical model, and vibration transmissibility was calculated as the ratio of recordings from helmet-mounted accelerometers and vertical vibration acceleration measured at the seat. The neck and body positions evaluated were: neutral, neck flexion 20 ° (for muscle activity, <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> and transmissibility), neck rotation 30 ° (EMG), and trunk inclination 20 ° (EMG). The head-worn equipment evaluated was: helmet alone, helmet and night vision goggles (NVG), and helmet, NVG and counterweight (all evaluated using EMG, <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> and transmissibility). Vibration was evaluated at different frequencies (2. 5 - 30 Hz) and magnitudes (0. 5, 1, and 2 m/s 2) using EMG and transmissibility. For the reliability testing of a neck fatigue protocol, the pilots performed isometric contractions in neck flexion and extension for 45 s, sustaining a force representing 75 % of maximum strength in a seated position. Subjective fatigue was rated using the Borg CR- 10 scale. The test was repeated twice the first day and then two additional times with one-week intervals. Variables analyzed were {{the slope of the}} median frequency change, the normalized slope, and the ratings after 15, 30 and 45 s; and also the initial median frequency (IMDF). The intra-class correlation (ICC) and the measurement error (S w), intra- and inter-day were calculated. Results: Dorsal neck muscle activity increased by 3 - 4 % of maximum voluntary electrical activation (MVE) as a cause of neck rotation, 2 - 3 % of neck flexion, and 1. 5 - 2. 5 % of trunk inclination. The use of NVG increased muscle activity in upper neck by 0. 5 - 1. 5 % and in lower neck by about 0. 5 %. Results with added counterweight were about the same as with NVG. Muscle activity increased by about 0. 5 - 1 % MVE as a function of vibration at frequencies around 4 - 5 Hz, with the higher levels when the neck was flexed. Muscle activity was also affected by vibration magnitude, where lower-neck-muscle and trapezius activity increased at the highest vibration level at frequencies around 4 - 5 Hz. The <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> was also affected by both neck flexion and NVG. The load at 20 ° flexion increased by about 8 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) compared to neutral and by about 3 % MVC when adding NVG compared to using helmet only. The load decreased somewhat when a counterweight was added. The transmissibility peak in a vertical direction was highest when the head was in neutral position and the fore-and-aft transmissibility peak was highest when the head was flexed. There were no effects of head-worn equipment concerning vertical transmissibility, but the fore-and-aft transmissibility peak level was lower with NVG. Different magnitudes of vibration gave only minor effects on transmissibility. The best reliability for the slope was found for the 45 s intra-day analysis, taking all measurements into account (ICC 0. 65 - 0. 83). Reliability after 30 s was poorer but still acceptable (ICC 0. 52 - 0. 71). For the subjective ratings, the highest reliability was found after 30 s inter-day (ICC 0. 86 - 0. 88). IMDF showed generally high reliability for the intra-day analyses (ICC 0. 63 - 0. 80). Conclusion: All three proposed risk factors caused measurable changes in muscle activity, <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> and seat-to-head transmissibility. Of the three, neck and body position caused the highest response. EMG and seat-to-head transmissibility responded somewhat different as function of vibration indicating that effects of vibration should be measured using more then one outcome measure. The protocol for measuring neck muscle fatigue can be considered reliable for use in further research. Since performing a contraction of 75 % of maximum was quite strenuous, it is recommended that the protocol period be shortened to 30 s...|$|E

At first the framework for design of offshore structures on the Norwegian continental shelf is presented {{for the purpose of}} indicating the annual exceedance probabilities of concern regarding design. The adequacy of the second order random model for the sea surface process is briefly indicated. It is suggested that freak waves should be defined as wave events from a population not captured by the second order model. Evidences of the existence of freak waves are discussed and possible originating mechanisms for their existence are commented upon. Finally, a probabilistic framework for accounting for freak waves in design is presented.

40|$|Experimental {{modelling}} of {{the interaction}} between a jet and an aircraft wing or fuselage in VTOL aircraft was undertaken using a cold jet exiting perpendicular to a flat plate in a uniform cross-flow. Effects of jet decay rate and jet-to-cross-flow velocity ratio, R, on the <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> distribution were investigated. Jet decay rate was increased by using cylindrical centerbodies submerged in the jet nozzle, which caused nonuniform initial jet velocity profiles. Quicker jet decay rate, corresponding to the presence of a centerbody, resulted in as much as 50 % reduction in the induced pressure loads on the plate. This has implications in interpretation of results from earlier VTOL model studies of jet induced loads, where the jets have often had relatively slow decay rates due to uniform initial velocity profile...|$|E
40|$|High {{tension cable}} {{guardrail}} is becoming increasing popular in median and roadside applications {{due to the}} promise of reduced deflections upon impact and reduced maintenance. As the performance of these systems is observed in service, {{there is a growing}} concern over the end anchorage foundation performance of current systems. Foundations for high tension systems must not only be capable of restraining the impact load of a vehicle but must also restrain the initial pretension on the cable system as well as temperature <b>induced</b> <b>loads.</b> While it may be acceptable for many roadside safety devices to require foundation repair after impact, foundation failure due to environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> would be a serious maintenance problem. As initial tension and temperature <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> can be greater than those loads applied during impact, this type of loading must be considered in foundation design. Foundation deflection can reduce cable tension, increasing deflection of the system during impact and letting the cables sag after impact. The soil conditions in which these foundations are placed vary significantly. This report considers the potential impact, tension, and temperature loads and develops a set of suggested foundation designs to accommodate a range of in situ soil conditions. These designs will vary significantly in different areas around the nation due to variations in both weather and in situ soil conditions. Deflection during full-scale crash tests may not accurately represent the foundation deflection that will be experienced in the field...|$|R

Compressive load relaxation was performed by deforming the lens by 10 % and measuring the force relaxation response for 100 s to obtain thickness, stiffness and relaxation of the <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> force and Maxwell parameters for human, monkey, porcine and leporine whole and decapsulated lenses. Thickness and percentage loading force relaxation increased linearly with lens age, whereas stiffness and <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> force increased exponentially. Human and monkey lenses aged at different rates. Loading force relaxation in a generalized Maxwell model was described by three time constants ranging from 1 to 1000 s. Compressive load relaxation is a very versatile method to study the viscoelastic properties of whole and decapsulated lenses and potentially also artificial accommodating lenses. The data presented in the study will help researchers choose the most suitable animal lenses based on the desired properties and age to be mimicked from the human lenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Topology {{control in}} ad-hoc {{networks}} {{is the problem}} of adjusting the transmission power at network nodes in order to achieve the optimal topology that maximizes network performance. Recently, using effective topology control to optimize energy usage in the network has come into focus in the research community[1, 2]. The common thesis arrived at by existing works is that the transmission range used by mobile nodes should be the minimum required to keep the network connected. We refer to such a topology as the minimally connected topology {{in the rest of the}} paper. We argue in this work that the minimally connected topology does not always provide the optimal performance in typical ad-hoc networks. We show that in contrast, for typical ad-hoc networks with a few hundred nodes distributed over a few square miles area, the optimal topology is a function of the traffic load. 1. BASIS FOR THE MYTH The reasons for the presumed optimality of the minimally connected topology can be explained as follows. When the transmission range is decreased, the average hop-count for the paths traversed by flows increases linearly. However, the transmission power per hop decreases super linearly (given that the path loss exponent typically ranges from 2 to 4). Hence, the overall energy consumption in the network for the same amount of data transferred is minimized in a minimally connected topology. Furthermore, when the transmission range in a network is decreased, the average hopcount of flows in the network increases, which in turn increases the total number of one-hop flows (mini-flows) in the network increases, thus increasing the aggregate <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> in the network (We distinguish the basic load offered by the sources of the flows from the <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> that is the basic load multiplied by the average number of hops traversed by flows.). However, a decrease in the transmission range also increases the spatial re-use in the network, thus increasing the network capacity. It can be shown that...|$|E

A chart based on dimensionless coefficients to facilitate the design of shallow foundation in environments typified by a 3 -layer stratigraphic model comprising sand-clay-sand has been presented.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the work done on a numerical method for the three-dimensional fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) problem. The aim of the development is the prediction of large amplitude wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i. e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level (exact body approach) and self interaction between the forward speed flow field and the radiated/diffracted waves.

It {{is clear from}} the scatter present in most experimental determinations of force coefficients that there are many individual factors which influence the mechanisms of flow <b>induced</b> <b>loading.</b> Among these are some, for instance Reynolds number, separation and periodic vortex shedding, which are inter-related and whose influences cannot be studied in isolation. Others, such as shear flow, irregular waves and free surface effects, can at least be eliminated in the laboratory, in order to approach an understanding of the more fundamental characteristics of the flow. A vertical cylinder in uniform waves experiences an incident flow field which can be described in terms of rotating velocity and acceleration vectors, always in the same vertical plane, containing also the cylinder axis, whose magnitudes are functions of time and of position {{along the length of the}} cylinder. Some of the essential features of this flow can be studied under two-dimensional oscillatory conditions, in which either the cylinder or the fluid is oscillated relative to the other along a straight line (planar oscillatory flow).
