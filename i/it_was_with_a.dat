He enjoyed a most productive season with both bat and gloves: in first-class cricket he hit 756 runs and made 48 dismissals (44 ct, 4 st) while in one-day cricket he scored 334 runs and claimed 21 dismissals (16 ct, 5 st). All these figures were either career bests or second to just one other season. His form dipped slightly in 1970, but he could be consoled with the award of his county cap.|$|E

Whitlam and the ALP, with little internal dissension, {{stood on a}} platform calling for domestic reform, an end to conscription, and the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam by 1 July 1970. Whitlam knew that, given the ALP's poor position after the 1966 election, victory was unlikely. Nevertheless, Whitlam scored an 18-seat swing, Labor's best performance since losing government in 1949. [...] Although the Coalition was returned for an eighth term in government, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slim majority of seven seats, down from 41 after the writs were dropped.

Turning the lights on sometimes brought relief, if only {{to keep him from}} falling asleep again. He had waking graphic flashbacks that caused him to freeze, reliving a life-threatening moment on the battlefield. His first wife Wanda Hendrix stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being moved to tears by newsreel footage of German war orphans, guilt-ridden that his war actions might have been the cause of their having no parents. As others had noticed since his return from Europe, Hendrix said his dreams were punctuated with the battles he had fought. She tried to coax him into seeking psychiatric help. During a publicity tour in 1952, his dreams caused him to beat the wall of his motel room until his fists bled.|$|E
500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not {{such a big deal}} to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E

2500|$|Charis, in {{the system}} of Valentinus, was an {{alternative}} name, with Ennoea and Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos (...) [...] The name expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness {{in which it is}} regarded not as a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Haer. xxxi. 6), dia to epikechoregekenai auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous. The use of the word Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by [...] ) to find in [...] the first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion arises that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to such an identification that names {{to be found in the}} prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data to pronounce. Charis has an important place {{in the system}} of Marcus (...) [...] The name Charis appears also in the system of the Barbelitae (...) , but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The word has possibly also a technical meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by Origen (...) , all of which end with the invocation he charis synesto moi, nai pater, synesto.|$|E
2500|$|For {{its first}} video player, {{which was based}} on the GNU Public Licensed (GPL) source code of XBMC Media Center, Voddler also {{developed}} its own encryption module, to protect the movies streamed via the player from unauthorized copying or downloading. [...] On 24 February 2010, the company closed down the service, having been hacked by anonymous programmers who had recreated these missing code parts that Voddler had added to its media player. [...] The missing code made it possible for other media player to attach to Voddler's own, so that the user could save the streamed films to their harddrive. [...] This use case violated the licensing deals that Voddler had signed with the content owners. [...] As motivation for their attack, the anonymous programmers said that Voddler, according to GPL, should have published the code for the encryption module back to the open source project. Voddler claimed they had met the requirements of GPL, which the anonymous group argued was wrong, insisting that Voddler had to distribute all of the Voddler source code needed to compile the Voddler player executable. When Voddler re-opened its service on 8 March 2010, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new media player, no longer based on XBMC. [...] Since encryption protection was essential for Voddler, in order to keep its content license agreements, and that giving the code module back to the open source project was tantamount to removing the encryption, Voddler chose to completely replace the player with a commercially available framework.|$|E
