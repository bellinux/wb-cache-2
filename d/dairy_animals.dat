25|$|From Southwest Asia {{domestic}} <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> {{spread to}} Europe (beginning around 7000 BC {{but did not}} reach Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC). The first farmers in central Europe and Britain milked their animals. Pastoral and pastoral nomadic economies, which rely predominantly or exclusively on domestic animals and their products rather than crop farming, were developed as European farmers moved into the Pontic-Caspian steppe in the fourth millennium BC, and subsequently spread {{across much of the}} Eurasian steppe. Sheep and goats were introduced to Africa from Southwest Asia, but African cattle may have been independently domesticated around 7000–6000 BC. Camels, domesticated in central Arabia in the fourth millennium BC, have also been used as <b>dairy</b> <b>animals</b> in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The earliest Egyptian records of burn treatments describe burn dressings using milk from mothers of male babies. In {{the rest of the world}} (i.e., East and Southeast Asia, the Americas and Australia) milk and dairy products were historically not a large part of the diet, either because they remained populated by hunter-gatherers who did not keep animals or the local agricultural economies did not include domesticated dairy species. Milk consumption became common in these regions comparatively recently, as a consequence of European colonialism and political domination over much of the world in the last 500 years.|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{are most}} likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the {{earliest}} animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk.

[...] Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as <b>dairy</b> <b>animals,</b> or as model organisms for science.|$|E

2500|$|Cheeses in Mexico have {{a history}} that begins with the Spanish conquest, as dairy {{products}} were unknown in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The Spanish brought <b>dairy</b> <b>animals,</b> such as cattle, sheep, and goats, as well as cheesemaking techniques. Over the colonial period, cheesemaking was modified to suit the mixed European and indigenous tastes of the inhabitants of New Spain, varying by region. This blending and variations {{have given rise to}} a number of varieties of Mexican cheeses. These are most popular in the country, although European cheeses are made, as well. Almost all cheese in Mexico is made with cows’ milk, with some made from goats’ milk. More recently, efforts have been made to promote sheep’s milk cheeses. Most cheeses are made with raw (unpasteurized) milk. [...] Cheeses are made in the home, on small farms or ranches, and by major dairy product firms. Between 20 and 40 different varieties of cheese are made in Mexico, depending on how one classifies them. Some, such as Oaxaca and panela, are made all over Mexico, but many are regional cheeses known only in certain sections on the country. Some of the least common are in danger of extinction.|$|E
