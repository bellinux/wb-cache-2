25|$|The SC 430 chassis {{featured}} a <b>double-wishbone</b> setup {{for both the}} front and rear wheels. The vehicle platform shared elements with the GS 430 sport sedan, including variable-assist power rack-and-pinion steering. Safety systems ranged from traction control to vehicle stability control. The convertible received a ULEV emissions certification rating.|$|E
25|$|The Roadsport {{is now the}} second-level {{offering}} from Caterham. It {{is available}} in both S3 and SV chassis sizes, and {{is more or less}} the former Classic with a more powerful engine and a few more extras as standard: heater; hood; spare wheel/carrier; carpets. The engine options are based around the Ford Sigma 1.6 (125bhp, 140bhp) and the Ford Duratec 2.0 (175bhp). Suspension is <b>double-wishbone</b> and anti-roll bar at the front; de dion axle located by an A-frame at the rear, where the old Classic specification had a live-axle set-up.|$|E
25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A <b>double-wishbone</b> setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The Domani {{utilizes}} 3 wheel {{independent suspension}} with <b>double-wishbones</b> at the rear and dual rocker arms at the front. These are connected to 185/60 - R14 tyres at the front and in the sidecar and 195/60 - R15 tyred at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The monocoque, {{according}} to Zenvo, {{is made of}} lightweight steel and aluminum. The suspension has been improved, which now includes a hydraulic lift system (HLS). It is also installed with front and rear <b>double-wishbones,</b> and 3-way power adjustable shock absorbers. The front and rear Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes are now larger, measuring 395 mm at the front and 380 mm at the rear, both including 6-piston calipers. The steering is rack-and-pinion with a 2.2 turn lock-to-lock.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Vigor also benefited from Honda deciding to employ <b>double-wishbones</b> {{at both the}} front and rear ends—a layout that spread to other Honda products in subsequent years. While more expensive than competitors' MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small 4-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the JDM 2.0-Si model [...] ), larger 4-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models. Base model Vigors rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels. As established with the first generation car, the luxury content was also extensive in comparison to luxury equipment available from competitors at the time. Some of the items on the top level 2.0Si included a power tinted glass moonroof, optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, optional coloured LCD digital instruments (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and engine temperature), tilt steering with speed sensitive power steering, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, electronic AM/FM stereo radio with cassette and 4 speakers (high power) with subwoofer and amplifier, intermittent front wipers (variable), 4-Wheel disc brakes (front: 2 piston calipers with ventilated front discs), and optional leather interior.|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} Lotus Six before it, the {{original}} Lotus Seven used an extremely light space-frame chassis with stressed aluminium body panels. Although the chassis has had numerous modifications to strengthen it and accommodate the various engine and suspension setups (and {{to try to}} find more cockpit space for the occupants), this basic formula has remained essentially the same throughout the Seven's life (with the exception of the Series 4, which used steel for the cockpit and engine bay and glassfibre for the bodywork). Early cars used a live rear axle, initially from various Fords, later from the Morris Ital. De Dion rear suspension was introduced in the mid-1980s and both geometries were on offer until 2002 when the live-axle option was phased out. The modern Superlight employs adjustable <b>double-wishbone</b> suspension with front anti-roll bar and a de-dion rear axle, located by an A-frame and Watt's linkage.|$|E
25|$|The Murciélago is an all-wheel drive, {{mid-engined}} supersports car. With an angular {{design and}} an exceptionally low slung body, {{the highest point}} of the roof is just under 4 feet above the ground. One of the vehicle's most distinguishing features are its scissor doors. which lends to the extreme image. First-generation Murciélagos, produced between 2001 and 2006, were powered by a Lamborghini V12 that traces its roots back to the company's beginnings in the 1960s. The rear differential is integrated with the engine itself, with a viscous coupling center differential providing drive to the front wheels. Power is delivered through a 6-speed manual transmission. The Murciélago suspension uses an independent <b>double-wishbone</b> design, and bodywork features carbon fiber, steel and aluminum parts. The rear spoiler and the active air intakes integrated into the car's shoulders are electromechanically controlled, deploying automatically only at high speeds {{in an effort to}} maximize both aerodynamic and cooling efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|This newfound {{emphasis}} on on-road refinement led Jeep {{to replace the}} XJ-era live-axle with leading-arms front suspension (found in the ZJ and WJ) with a new design: an independent <b>double-wishbone</b> setup like that which debuted in the 2002 Liberty. [...] The new Jeep changed its philosophy due to what it perceived as increasing demand in the SUV marketplace for on-road performance and decreasing demand for off-road capability. Although classed as a truck-based SUV, the WH/WK Grand Cherokee has more luxuries than a [...] "crossover" [...] especially refinement, capability and NVH.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} power steering rack with a 14.3:1 gear ratio is used. The front suspension utilizes a <b>double-wishbone</b> arrangement {{and there is a}} multi-link arrangement at the rear with coil-over dampers at all wheels.

[...] The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system. The initial price of the car is around $100,000.|$|E
2500|$|Italdesign Giugiaro {{began the}} first design {{drawings}} of the GS 300 in 1988. The design firm aimed to produce a deluxe saloon which did without the numerous exterior features and detailing found on existing Japanese premium sedans, {{in favor of a}} more simplified, European-style appearance. The vehicle's exterior styling blended elements of the then-current Lexus LS flagship and SC performance coupe in a rounded, aerodynamic wedge-like shape which featured a high rear decklid and longer and wider proportions than rival vehicles. The exterior produced a [...] The offered color schemes included single-tone bumper and body finishes, along with dual-tone schemes. Similarities with an Italdesign concept car which debuted in 1990, the Jaguar Kensington, led some observers to suggest that the GS 300 was derived from its design, but the firm has stated that the GS 300 was developed earlier. Equipped with an independent, <b>double-wishbone</b> suspension setup at both front and rear ends, Italdesign's saloon design first appeared in Toyota Aristo form in Japan in October 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The Caterham 7 {{range was}} based {{exclusively}} on this Series 3 chassis until 2000, when the SV (Series V, or Special Vehicle) chassis was released, aimed at accommodating {{the increasing number}} of prospective buyers who could not fit comfortably in the Series 3 cockpit. The SV chassis offers an extra [...] of width across the cockpit, at a cost of [...] of extra weight, and both chassis sizes are available today in Roadsport and Superlight variants. The SV chassis subsequently provided the basic dimensions for the Caterham CSR. The suspension was completely redesigned, bringing the front suspension inboard, using pushrods, and replacing the De-Dion rear axle with a lighter, fully independent, <b>double-wishbone</b> layout with new coil/damper units. Additional chassis modifications resulted in a 25% increase in torsional stiffness. The CSR was released in October 2004, with a Cosworth Duratec engine and is currently available from the factory in either [...] or [...] form.|$|E
