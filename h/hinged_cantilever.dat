40|$|Abstract: The Hyperextension test of clam {{cellular}} phones {{is one of}} the mechanical qualification test to qualify the hinge area of the main house and the flip. This test resembles a simple <b>hinged</b> <b>cantilever</b> bending type of problem, and looks easy to solve, but typically fails to converge in implicit Finite Element Analysis (FEA) codes (for example: ABAQUS/Standard). This is due to large number of components interacting together inside the flip. The initial failure is related to the size of maximum Degree of Freedom (DOF) wave front and is caused {{by the size of the}} contact area by several components. The second common problem is convergence during contact. When problems like these fail to solve in Implicit code, the Explicit code is a good tool for the analysist to consider. A novice analyst typically uses mass scaling to solve convergence problems. However mass scaling can distort the dynamic behavior of the model. This study emphasizes the use of damping to obtain a converged solution instead of mass scaling. However if damping coefficients are not selected correctly, the solution may take an excessive time to converge. This paper discusses the selection of the optimum damping factor to obtain static equilibrium in the shortest possible solution time. This technique also provides information about the total CPU time required in the solution step. This technique is demonstrated on a cell phone application...|$|E

In this study, one novel XY micropositioning stage is proposed, in which bi-axis circular notch flexure and <b>cantilever</b> <b>hinge</b> mechanism are optimal designed as bearing to provide smooth and guided motion. The theoretical stiffness of stage is provided and verified by FEM analysis. Finally, the micro-positioning stage is built and its resolution is experimentally validated {{to be less than}} 4 nm...|$|R
40|$|A {{reliable}} {{fabrication process}} for passive, monolithic microstructures is described. It is shown that by using pressure as a variable during {{physical vapour deposition}} (PVD), the stress in the deposited films can be controlled. A built-in stress gradient obtained by depositing the structural layer at different pressures results in a relatively predictable out-of-plane deflection of the structure after release. Sacrificial aluminum underneath molybdenum structures {{was found to be}} the most reliable combination of materials. Thermal stress fracturing at the <b>hinges</b> of the <b>cantilever</b> structures was reduced by altering the deposition process. status: publishe...|$|R

The antenna consists of rigid panels of graphite-epoxy facesheets covering aluminum honeycomb sandwich. The six main folding panels are <b>hinged</b> to a <b>cantilevered</b> support ring attached to {{the periphery of the}} center section. Six pairs of intermediate panels are located between these panels and are hinged {{to each other and to}} the main panels. The flight configuration, antenna weight, a mass properties, frequency, and contour tolerance are discussed. The advantages of the solid antenna surface cover an all-mesh contour are examined...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} articulated {{rotor blade}} has mechanical flap and lag hinges, a lag damper, and a pitch bearing. In connection {{with an interest}} in designs of greater mechanical simplicity and increased maintainability, hingeless and bearingless rotors have been developed. A hingeless blade lacks the <b>hinges</b> and is <b>cantilevered</b> at the hub. It does have a pitch bearing for pitch control. A bearingless design eliminates the hinges and the pitch bearing as well. In the present investigation of bearingless rotor blade characteristics, finite element analysis has been successfully applied to determine the solutions of the nonlinear trim equations and the linearized flutter equations of multiple-load-path blades. The employed formulation is based on Hamilton's principle. The spatial dependence of the equations of motion is discretized by dividing the flexbeams, the torque tube, and the outboard into a number of elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of realizing dry precast emulative moment-resisting frames is a relevant innovation, while {{the heritage of}} precast structures consists mostly in frames with <b>hinged</b> beams and <b>cantilever</b> columns restrained at their base. The transformation of hinges in restraints becomes necessary while facing the need to reduce deformations under severe horizontal loads, especially seismic. Reduced stresses and increased ductility can be achieved, avoiding the ???soft floor??? mechanism through the energy dissipation provided by the steel placed in horizontal members. Precast structures with adaptable restraints (PRESAR) are therefore presented in their essential features, among them the {{possibility of}} mix of a dry precast construction technology and the stiffness and redundancy provided by a traditional cast-in-situ frame. A design comparison between 3 precast frames with the same geometries but different static schemes shows how this structural flexibility can be exploited to optimize the structure...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Civil Engineering, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 78 - 82) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Enlishxi, 93 leavesFlange and web {{local buckling}} in beam plastic hinge regions of welded Steel Moment Frames (SMF) can prevent the beam-column connections to achieve adequate plastic rotations under earthquake induced forces. Reducing the web-flange slenderness ratios {{is the most}} effective way in preventing local member buckling as stipulated in the latest earthquake specifications. However, older steel beam-column connections that lack the adequate slenderness ratios stipulated for new SMFs are vulnerable to local plastic buckling. This study investigates postponing the formation of local buckles in beam flanges and webs at the plastic hinge region of modified SMF connections (welded haunch) by the use of externally bonded Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP). The research includes finite element (FE) modeling. The energy dissipation capacity of existing SMF connections is anticipated to increase with GFRP laminates bonded to flanges of beams in plastic <b>hinge</b> locations. <b>Cantilever</b> beams with and without GFRP were analyzed under quasi-static cyclic loading and the effects to the plastic local buckling of the GFRP laminates added to the steel beams were observed. Both geometric and material nonlinearities are considered. The mechanical properties of the GFRP material were obtained through standard ASTM tests and were utilized directly in the FE model. Steel beams with flange slenderness ratios of 8 to 12 and web slenderness ratios of 40 - 60 - 80 were analyzed. Results indicate that GFRP strips can effectively delay the formation of local plastic buckling in the plastic hinge region...|$|R
40|$|In Southern Europe the {{heritage}} and the everyday practice of precast structures consists mostly in dry or semidry assembled frames with <b>hinged</b> beams and <b>cantilever</b> columns restrained at their base. Such structures {{can provide a}} large energy dissipation, but they are intrinsically very flexible, especially if moving from industrial mono-storey buildings to commercial or residential multi-storey buildings. Their design becomes influenced by the need of reducing such flexibility, thus largely over-dimensioning the members and obtaining a complex seismic behaviour due {{to the influence of}} higher modes. Two solutions are envisaged to solve this problem by keeping the key feature of precast structures, that is the speed of erection: the introduction of dry or semi-dry assembled precast walls (particularly favourable in case of residential buildings) or the stiffening of the classical statically determined frame by means of introduction of moment resisting beam-column connections made with mechanical devices (mostly envisaged in the case of commercial buildings). In such enhanced frames, the realization of clamped joints can be performed in a second stage of the erection process, adapting the existing hinged connection realized at the first stage to clamped by activating the mechanical devices. Precast structures with adaptable restraints (PRESAR) are therefore presented in their essential features, among them the possibility of mix of a high quality dry precast construction technology with high speed of erection and the stiffness and redundancy provided by a traditional cast-in-situ frame. If properly designed, the horizontal members can fully be exploited by transferring the dead loads in a simply supported scheme before being adapted to clamped, with improvements in the behaviour and design of the whole building. A design comparison among 3 precast frames with similar geometries but different static schemes shows how this structural flexibility can be exploited to optimize the structure. A further comparison made on the real nonlinear dynamic behaviour of 4 different structures, ranging from flexible hinged frame to stiff coupled wallframe...|$|R
