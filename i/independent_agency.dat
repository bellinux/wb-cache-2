5000|$|The term [...] "government agency" [...] or [...] "administrative agency" [...] usually {{applies to}} one of the <b>independent</b> <b>agencies</b> of the United States government, which {{exercise}} some degree of independence from the President's control. Although the heads of <b>independent</b> <b>agencies</b> are often appointed by the government, they can usually be removed only for cause.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically <b>independent</b> <b>agency,</b> b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
