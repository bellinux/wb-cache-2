40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{approach}} to enhance the accuracy of structure from motion (SfM) in the two-view case. We first answer the question: " fewer data with higher accuracy, or more data with less accuracy? " For this, we establish a relation between SfM errors and {{a function of the}} number of matches and their epipolar errors. Using an accuracy estima-tor of individual matches, we then propose a method to select a subset of matches that has a good quality vs. quantity compromise. We also propose a variant of least squares matching to refine match locations based on a <b>focused</b> <b>grid</b> and a multi-scale exploration. Experiments show that both selection and refinement contribute independently to a better accuracy. Their combination reduces errors by a factor of 1. 1 to 2. 0 for rotation, and 1. 6 to 3. 8 for translation...|$|E
40|$|An ion {{accelerator}} system that successfully combines geometrical and electrostatic focusing principles is presented. This {{accelerator system}} uses thin, concave, multiple-hole, closely spaced graphite screen and <b>focusing</b> <b>grids</b> which are coupled to single slot accelerator and decelerator grids to provide high ion extraction efficiency and good focusing. Tests {{with the system}} showed a substantial improvement in ion beam current density and collimation as compared with a Pierce electrode configuration. Durability of the thin graphite screen and <b>focusing</b> <b>grids</b> has been proven, and tests are being performed to determine the minimum screen and <b>focusing</b> <b>grid</b> spacing and thickness required to extract the maximum reliable beam current density. Compared with present neutral beam injector accelerator systems, this one has more efficient ion extraction, easier grid alignment, easier fabrication, a less cumbersome design, {{and the capacity to}} be constructed in a modular fashion. Conceptual neutral beam injector designs using this modular approach have electrostatic beam deflection plates downstream of each module...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a simple way}} to generate a wide-area high-resolution <b>focus</b> <b>grid</b> by in-line holography and study the factors that impacts its quality. In our holographic recording setup, the reference beam was the direct transmission of the incoming collimated laser beam through a mask coating with thin metal film, and the sample beam was the transmission of the laser through small apertures fabricated on the mask. The interference of the two beams was then recorded by a holographic plate positioned behind the mask. Compared with other recording schemes, the in-line holography scheme has many distinct advantages and is more suitable for generating a wide-area <b>focus</b> <b>grid.</b> We explored the dependence of diffraction quality, including reconstructed focus spot intensity and spot size, on different parameters for recording, such as optical density of the metal film, size of the apertures, and focal lengths. A wide-area <b>focus</b> <b>grid</b> (170 x 138 spots with area 5. 1 mm x 4. 1 mm) was recorded using the in-line holography scheme for a demonstration...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a focal plane tuning technique for use in focus-grid-based wide-field-of-view microscopy (WFM). In WFM, the incidence of a collimated beam on a mask with a two-dimensional grid of aperture produced the Talbot images of the aperture grid. The Talbot pattern functioned as a <b>focus</b> <b>grid</b> and was used to illuminate the sample. By scanning the sample across the <b>focus</b> <b>grid</b> and collecting the transmission, we can generate a microscopy image of the sample. By tuning the wavelength of the laser, we can tune the focal plane of the WFM and acquire images of different depth into the sample. Images of a green algae microscope slide were acquired at different focal planes for demonstration...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel microscope technique that can achieve wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging and yet possess resolution that is comparable to conventional microscope. The principle of wide FOV microscope system breaks the link between resolution and FOV magnitude of traditional microscopes. Furthermore, by eliminating bulky optical elements from its design and utilizing holographic optical elements, the wide FOV microscope system is more cost-effective. In our system, a hologram was made to focus incoming collimated beam into a <b>focus</b> <b>grid.</b> The sample is put in the focal plane and the transmissions of the focuses are detected by an imaging sensor. By scanning the incident angle of the incoming beam, the <b>focus</b> <b>grid</b> will scan across the sample and the time-varying transmission can be detected. We can then reconstruct the transmission image of the sample. The resolution of microscopic image {{is limited by the}} size of the focus formed by the hologram. The scanning area of each focus spot is determined by the separation of the focus spots and can be made small for fast imaging speed. We have fabricated a prototype system with a 2. 4 -mm FOV and 1 -μm resolution. The prototype system was used to image onion skin cells for a demonstration. The preliminary experiments prove the feasibility of the wide FOV microscope technique, and the possibility of a wider FOV system with better resolution...|$|R

Light pulses with an exponential decay rate of approximately one decade per sixty microseconds, as well as other pulse shapes, were used to drive the tubes. Properties studied in the analog mode include nonlinearity at high output currents, transient behavior upon gating, gate holdoff, dynamic range limitations because of light-induced noise, and the effect of dynode gating on tubes without a <b>focus</b> <b>grid.</b> Some of these properties were also studied in the photon counting mode, along with single photoelectron pulse shape and afterpulsing.

50|$|The {{phosphors}} were pattered in an RGB-BGR-RGB pattern. The <b>focusing</b> <b>grid</b> {{was aligned}} so the beam would normally focus {{down onto the}} green strips {{in the middle of}} each pair of wires. To produce different colors, say blue, the beam would have to be pulled to the right for one pixel, and then to the left for the next. Since the adjacent stripes of phosphors shared one of the wires, this meant that a single voltage setting would produce the blue color on two adjacent pixels. Since a single frame of color television does not consist of a single color, the deflection system had to be continually varied as the beam moved across the screen.|$|R

The positron re-emission measurements are performed at a vacuum of 10 - 8 Torr.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} create and subsequently manage secure virtual organisations (VO) {{is one of}} the key challenges facing the Grid community. Existing approaches for establishing and managing VOs typically suffer from lack of fine grained security since they largely focus on public key infrastructures with statically defined access control lists, or they are based upon a centralised site for storage of VO specific security information. What is really needed is a federated model of security where sites are able to manage their own security information for their own institutional members, delegating where necessary to trusted local or remote entities, as well as defining and enforcing authorisation policies for their own resources. In this paper we present tools that support such capabilities and highlight how they have been applied to dynamically create and manage security focused VOs in the education domain. We believe that this federated VO security model for fine grained access to Grid services and resources should be the future model upon which security <b>focused</b> <b>Grids</b> are based. 1...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is moving}} into two ways. The Computational <b>Grid</b> <b>focuses</b> on reducing execution time of applications {{that require a}} great number of computer processing cycles. The Data Grid provides the way to solve large scale data management problems. Data intensive applications such as High Energy Physics and Bioinformatics require both Computational and Data Grid features. Job scheduling in Grid has been mostly discussed from the perspective of computational Grid. However, scheduling on Data Grid is just a recent <b>focus</b> of <b>Grid</b> computing activities. In Data Grid environment, effective scheduling mechanism considering both computational and data storage resources must be provided for large scale data intensive applications. In this paper, we describe new scheduling model that considers both amount of computational resources and data availability in Data Grid environment. We implemented a scheduler, called Chameleon, based on the proposed application scheduling model. Chameleon shows performance improvements in data intensive applications that require both large number of processors and data replication mechanisms. The results achieved from Chameleon are presented. 1...|$|R
