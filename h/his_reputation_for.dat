5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> originality.|$|E
5|$|A decade later, the {{brothers}} invested in FortuneFish, a new Nottingham-based mobile game studio started by Tim Stamper's son. FortuneFish released a rhythm-based platform game in 2017 whose {{art and music}} recalled Rare's signature Donkey Kong Country-era style. The company {{is one of several}} new ventures planned by the Stampers. Tim Stamper broke with <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> secrecy around the same time by posting publicly on Twitter about Rare's canceled Project Dream.|$|E
5|$|England never seriously {{threatened}} {{to reach the}} victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the world record for a fourth-innings run chase. Allan Lamb added to <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> mastering fast bowling with a defiant 113, but it was sizeable contributions from the tail and extras that took England to a respectable total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.|$|E
50|$|Bessarion made {{no attempt}} to defend himself, {{claiming}} he was not interested in being elected; <b>his</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> reform and austerity also would have been unpopular with many of the Renaissance cardinals. Nevertheless, the renowned humanist scholar remained a strong candidate in the following 1464 conclave as well.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the elder}} Symeon's advice, {{he left for}} the nearby Monastery of St. Mammas in Constantinople, which was {{described}} as run down, both physically and spiritually. During his time at St. Mammas he continued to follow Symeon the Studite's guidance. Within three years after moving to St. Mammas, Symeon was tonsured as a monk, ordained as a priest, and elected as the abbot of the monastery. He spent the next twenty-five years as abbot of St. Mammas, attracting many monks and clergy with <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> learning and sanctity.|$|E
5|$|Nicolls {{was born}} in Coleraine, Ireland, in a family with a {{military}} tradition, and raised there until entering school in Greenwich. In 1795, {{at the age of}} 15, he received his first commission in the Royal Marines, and began service with shipborne detachments of marines. During the Napoleonic Wars and associated conflicts in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and North Sea, he served as a commander of ships' detachments, and gained <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> ferocity and courage.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> centuries to come.|$|E

5000|$|His {{contemporary}} Frank Harris later summed Marks up {{as a man}} of [...] "few scruples {{and many}} interests"; nowhere was this more clear than the way in which he exploited <b>his</b> paper's <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> own commercial schemes.|$|R
5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 – September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} built <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> {{paintings}} and drawings of desert subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert, Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most important work, Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige died on 22 December 1060 and {{was buried}} at Peterborough, {{in what is}} now Peterborough Cathedral. After his death, he was honoured as a saint by the monks at Peterborough, {{although}} the cult {{does not seem to have}} spread far. His bones, along with those of his predecessor Ælfric Puttoc, were found in 1643. <b>His</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> sanctity and poverty was based on his actions, as he often traveled on foot, and spent much time preaching and giving alms. The Northumbrian Priests' Law which is usually attributed to Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, might have been authored instead by Cynesige, or possibly Cynesige's predecessor Ælfric Puttoc. He gave gifts to Peterborough in his will, but the gifts were taken by Queen Edith instead.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a {{milestone}} in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, {{many of which have}} Gothic elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the Roman emperor Nero, but they became estranged after its failure. For the actor, playing Jekyll and Hyde helped establish <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> dramatic roles; he had been known primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1815 {{and set up}} in {{business}} for himself, working until 1818 at his father's Blackfriars premises.

5|$|Phan {{was never}} {{known for his}} {{scholarly}} abilities; it was <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> principled integrity {{that led to his}} quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh Bình Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Huế court eventually removed Phan from this post.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{was born}} into the Byzantine nobility and given a {{traditional}} education. At age fourteen he met Symeon the Studite, a renowned monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople, who convinced him to give his own life to prayer and asceticism under the elder Symeon's guidance. By {{the time he was}} thirty, Symeon the New Theologian became the abbot of the Monastery of St. Mammas, a position he held for twenty-five years. He attracted many monks and clergy with <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> sanctity, though his teachings brought him into conflict with church authorities, who would eventually send him into exile. His most well known disciple was Nicetas Stethatos who wrote the Life of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|The Browns began play in 1946, and Rymkus {{soon became}} an anchor of the team's {{offensive}} and defensive lines. He solidified <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> toughness by playing more than 50 minutes per game that year despite a knee injury for which he needed surgery immediately after the season. On defense, Rymkus helped stop opponents' rushing attacks and disrupt the opposing quarterback. On offense, he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and opened up running room for fullback Marion Motley. Graham led the AAFC in total passing yards over its four years of existence, while Motley {{led the league in}} rushing.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> {{national}} <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> one plate color etching {{made him}} a instantaneously recognized figure in Tucson’s emerging artist community.

50|$|In 1721 <b>his</b> high <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> ability, learning, purity, and {{a kindly}} {{disposition}} secured his election to succeed Clement XI as Pope Innocent XIII.

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, {{with the}} support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was {{appointed}} an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> recklessness.|$|E
50|$|Elrington Ball {{describes}} {{him as a}} man {{of great}} wisdom and learning; although he was in disfavour for parts of his career he was always restored to a position of influence, as his advice was found to be indispensable.

5|$|Increased support also materialised {{when the}} Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp, the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought {{financial}} aid from Nasjonal Samling, {{who in turn}} gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, {{in part because of}} competition from the Conservative Party for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of Nasjonal Samling's existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the October elections, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, getting rid of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1931–32, Fingleton capitalised on {{illnesses}} to teammates to gain {{a regular}} position for New South Wales and then make his debut for Australia. He secured {{a position in the}} state team after Archie Jackson developed terminal tuberculosis and made 93 and 117 in his first two innings for the season, his highest scores to that point. He was then called into the Test squad and made his debut in the Fifth and final Test of the season against South Africa after Bill Ponsford fell ill. On a pitch rendered hostile by rain, Fingleton made 40 in an innings victory, surpassing the entire aggregate scored by the South Africans in their first innings. The following season, Fingleton enhanced <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> defiance in difficult conditions by scoring an unbeaten century against the Bodyline attack in a tour match despite suffering multiple bruises, and compiling 83 in the low-scoring Second Test, Australian's only Test win of the series. However, he made a pair in the next Test and the controversy over England's bowling peaked with the leaking of Woodfull's admonishment of Warner over England's tactics. At the time, Fingleton was widely believed to be responsible for the leak, although he always denied it and blamed Bradman. Over time, Fingleton's view has become more widely accepted.|$|E
