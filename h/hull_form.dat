40|$|In {{contrast}} of generating <b>hull</b> <b>forms</b> {{more or less}} from scratch, the present method uses existing <b>hull</b> <b>forms.</b> This approach allows to improve manually optimised <b>hull</b> <b>forms</b> as they are available on ship yards. To reduce the search domain of possible changes to a starting hull, a set of transformation functions is used. These functions allow a systematic variation of hull characteristics. Generated <b>hull</b> <b>forms</b> are evaluated by CFD tools like the wave-resistance code KELVIN. Spline approximations in the optimization search space allow {{to reduce the number}} of actual CFD evaluations, accelerating the optimization process. The modular procedure allows exchanging individually optimization algorithm, different CFD solver, or target function. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Drawing-bulging forming is a forming method both {{deep drawing}} forming and bulge forming, {{it has been}} studied in a {{centrifuge}} cover for instance. The forming processes of the centrifuge cover have been analyzed, and the convex <b>hull</b> <b>forming</b> of the forming processes is a typical drawing-bulging <b>forming.</b> The convex <b>hull</b> <b>forming</b> has been analyzed by the theoretical calculations and finite element numerical simulation. The results shows that the convex <b>hull</b> <b>forming</b> should be earlier than the box-shaped forming, in this case, material flow is more conducive to control. In {{order to avoid the}} rupture in the forming process of the convex hull, the convex <b>hull</b> <b>forming</b> can be divided into two steps to complete, it can reduce inward deformation resistance of the external metal, and increase the composition of the deep drawing in the drawing-bulging forming, and ease the thinning of the convex hull of the corresponding location. Finally, the reasonable process plan of the workpiece was determined...|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy <b>hull</b> <b>form.</b> Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the <b>hull</b> <b>form,</b> particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E

40|$|Although {{catamaran}} configuration {{has been}} around for a longtime, it is only in the recent past that such <b>hull</b> <b>forms</b> have seen unprecedented growth in the high-speed ferry industry. One of the design challenges faced by naval architects is accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of such vessels primarily in the areas of resistance, propulsion and seakeeping. Even though considerable amount of research has been carried out in this area, there remains a degree of uncertainty in the prediction of calm water resistance of catamaran <b>hull</b> <b>forms.</b> This paper attempts to present the research work carried out so far and what needs to be undertaken in future for a reasonably accurate prediction of catamaran resistance characteristics. The authors have examined the deep water wave resistance characteristics of a series of transom stern, semi-displacement slender catamaran <b>hull</b> <b>forms</b> of round bilge as well as single chine <b>hull</b> <b>forms,</b> which are of utmost importance to the high-speed ferry industry. The accuracy of the established regression equation has been seen to deviate appreciably by various sources of uncertainties. Verification of the equation with experimental database is also lacking to a certain extent. Further research is therefore needed to refine the accuracy as well as to complete the selection of crucial parameters employed. However, the results obtained have shown considerable promise, and a regression equation for predicting wave resistance of catamarans in calm water can be seen as achievable...|$|R
40|$|In present work, a {{simplified}} methodology {{able to provide}} a sufficiently accurate assessment of wave drift forces is presented, {{with the aim of}} providing a procedure which may be applied in the preliminary stages of the design, when the technical data of the ship (such as the <b>hull</b> <b>forms)</b> are not yet available, and only main hull parameters are present.
