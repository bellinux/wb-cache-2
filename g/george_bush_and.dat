25|$|Michael J. Badnarik (born August 1, 1954) is an American {{software}} engineer, political figure, {{and former}} {{radio talk show}} host. He was the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2004 elections, and placed fourth in the race, behind independent candidate Ralph Nader and the two major party candidates, <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> John Kerry. Two years later he ran as a Libertarian Party candidate in the 2006 congressional elections for Texas's 10th congressional district seat near Austin. In a three candidate field, Badnarik came in third, receiving 7,603 votes for 4.3% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, {{let me tell you}} something about <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and it bothered me that so many people seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E

The first chapter characterizes neoconservatism and liberalism and deals in more detail with the principles of these theoretical movements (the next chapters analyzes whether these principles were implemented in <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush's</b> <b>and</b> Barack Obama's foreign policy towards selected countries of the Middle East region).

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1993, Long wrote a {{fortnightly}} {{political satire}} column for National Review titled Letters from Al.

2500|$|In 2007, Davidson {{entered a}} second {{performance}} {{with a similar}} topic, entitled Bad Knight II, which got {{the attention of the}} then Federal Minister for Education, Julie Bishop, who accused the teachers of having [...] "private political agendas" [...] and said that Davidson [...] "interestingly" [...] did the performance {{around the time of the}} Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where U.S. President <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> other foreign leaders would be visiting. The performance was defended by the NSW Minister for Education and Training, John Della Bosca, who accused Bishop of using her supposed concern over the school's performance to criticise the public education system: [...] "I think it's another demonstration of how far out of touch Mrs Bishop and her colleagues in the Howard government are...the concern they have is just another (opportunity) to run down the achievements of young people in public education." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, {{during a}} speech by May to a London, Ontario United Church of Canada, she said that [...] "In the eyes of history, John Howard, <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> <b>and</b> Stephen Harper will be judged more {{culpable}} than Neville Chamberlain." [...] "We have {{a moral obligation to}} our Lord and Father to ensure we don't destroy the creation that was given to us. Through the power of our Lord and Jesus Christ, we can meet this moral obligation," [...] said May. She condemned Prime Minister Stephen Harper's stance on climate change, comparing it to [...] "a grievance worse than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of the Nazis." [...] The statement drew criticism from the Canadian Jewish Congress and opposition parties. While Opposition leader Stéphane Dion refused to respond to Harper's request for him to distance himself from May and these remarks during Question Period, Dion did state to reporters outside Commons that May should withdraw the remarks, and that the Nazi regime is beyond any comparison. May said she was having [...] "a lousy week" [...] because of the federal government's weak action plan on the environment, was standing by her comments.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{criticized the}} film for not {{mentioning}} {{the history of}} repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state {{of human rights in}} Saddam Hussein's Iraq, nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens writes, [...] "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic." [...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ...
