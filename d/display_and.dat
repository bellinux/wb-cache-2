5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they <b>display</b> <b>and</b> attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with <b>display</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore transfer.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> {{exhibitions}} in university libraries. It was conducted by questionnaire survey on six theses: Frequency and purpose, Staffing, Funding, Space and safeguards, Subjects, materials and sources, and Marketing. The results reveal that most libraries held <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions <b>and</b> thought <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions as marketing and educational ser-vices to patrons. But supporting resources such as staffing, funding, space, security, and facilities were informal and scant. To improve the <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions, this paper suggests that libraries should pay more resources <b>and</b> concerns on <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions to achieve the marketing and educational goal. Besides, librarians play important roles in <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions. To plan a professional <b>and</b> successful <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions, librarians need more support on training, <b>display</b> knowledge <b>and</b> credits...|$|R

5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science.

5|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today's terms) for Sirens and for Samson and Delilah, also {{exhibited}} by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry, {{and as soon as}} it was complete Sirens began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public <b>display,</b> <b>and</b> placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 Sirens was returned to public <b>display</b> <b>and</b> is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.|$|E
