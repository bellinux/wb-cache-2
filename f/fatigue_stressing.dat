40|$|The {{arrangement}} of the hangers in tied arch bridges {{is one of the}} key issues in optimizing the design of this typology of bridges. Bending moments in the arch and the tie and axial forces in the hangers are usually the parameters on which attention is focused. The hangers are particularly vulnerable to fatigue phenomena but the variation of axial forces in hangers is not deeply studied despite the fact that it is an important parameter in relation to the fatigue behaviour of the hangers. In this context, this paper mainly deals with the reduction of <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing</b> in hangers of road arch bridges. The analysis is carried out by varying the vehicular load position along the deck; the assumed parameters are the maximum variation and the average variation of the hanger force. Various hanger arrangements are considered: vertical, fan and network arrangement with inclined hangers having multiple intersections. One of the main results is that, on the one hand, vertical and fan arrangements are better than network ones if the fatigue in the hangers is considered as the only parameter, and, on the other hand, network arrangements are globally the best if the bending moments in the arch and the tie and the absolute values of the axial forces in hangers are also considered. Therefore, the work also focuses on decreasing the <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing</b> of vertical, fan and network arrangements without increasing the bending moments in the arch and the tie. The results suggest that a slight modification of the radial arrangement near the arch springing points, namely using steeper hangers, leads to a smaller force variation in the hangers without increasing the bending moments in the arch and the tie...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} high cycle fretting fatigue crack nucleation prediction. A plastic steel/steel cylinder/plane contact was investigated keeping constant the normal force and the maximum <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> ratio but varying the <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> ratio (RF= 0. 6 to 1). The evolution of the crack length as function of the applied fretting tangential force amplitude at 10 ^ 6 cycles allows us to formalize the crack nucleation condition. It shows that the threshold tangential force marking the crack nucleation (i. e. bp_th= 0 Î¼m) is not affected by the <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> ratio. However an increase of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> amplitude sharply increases the crack extension. To model the experiments, a 2 D plastic plain strain FEM modeling is performed. As expected the computed stress field description is mesh dependent. However we demonstrate that a representative stress description is obtained at the 3 rd node (i. e. 2 nd node below the surface). By coupling this mesh condition and non-local critical distance approach, reliable prediction of the crack nucleation risk can be achieved either considering a Crossland multi-axial fatigue analysis or using a basic uni-axial Haighs description...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in an attempt}} to determine the behavior of high purity aluminum when subjected to <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing</b> in rotary bending at various elevated temperatures, and also to study the effects on fatigue life when the material was given intermittent periods of rest. Two types of rest periods were given; 1) room temperature resting from fatigue cycling at elevated temperature, and 2) resting at higher temperature after stressing at ambient temperature. Because of the limited time available and the desire to apply statistical methods of analysis, testing was restricted to only a single stress level for each phase of the experiment. Up to the highest temperature tested (600 [degrees]F), results for continuous stress cycling indicate a gradual reduction in fatigue life with temperature. Rest periods at room temperature contributed only negligible changes in fatigue life, but all tests with rest periods at elevated temperature disclosed a sizable increase. The increase in fatigue life was a maximum when resting was carried out at temperatures in the neighborhood of the recrystallization temperature. In addition, it is curious to note, that in the continuous cycling tests, scatter of results was a sharp minimum at recrystallization temperature...|$|E

Results {{from the two}} methods agreed well. The CTOA measurements and observations of the fracture surfaces showed that the initial stable tearing {{behavior of}} low and high <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests is significantly different. The cracks in the low <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests underwent a transition from flat-to-slant crack growth, during which the CTOA values were high and significant crack tunneling occurred. After crack growth equal to about the thickness, CTOA reached a constant value of 6 deg and after crack growth equal to about twice the thickness, crack tunneling stabilized. The initial high CTOA values, in the low fatigue crack tests, coincided with large three-dimensional crack front shape changes due to {{a variation in the}} through-thickness crack tip constraint. The cracks in the high <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress</b> tests reach the same constant CTOA value after crack growth equal to about the thickness, but produced only a slightly higher CTOA value during initial crack growth.

Seventeen junior soccer players took part in this study. The individual Hooper's indices takenbefore each training session were correlated with RPE- 10 min during a constant intensity and duration effort (10 min) using Pearson product moment correlation. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to assess the internal consistency of the RPE- 10 min. All individual correlations between RPE- 10 min and quality of sleep and quantity of <b>fatigue,</b> <b>stress,</b> and DOMS were non-significant (p N 0. 05). No significant correlations wereresulted between RPE- 10 min and Hooper's Index in all athletes. The ICC of RPE- 10 min was 0. 77 thus demonstrating internal consistency. The results of the present study demonstrated the objectivity and utility of RPE as a psychological tool for monitoring training during traditional soccer training. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that <b>fatigue,</b> <b>stress,</b> DOMS and sleep are not major contributors of perceived exertionduring traditional soccer training without excessive training loads.

40|$|International audienceFretting fatigue is {{characterized}} by combined high stress gradients induced by contact loading and more homogeneous stress gradients induced by bulk <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing.</b> The stress gradients computed at the "hot-spot" located on the surface at the trailing contact border are very high, usually above 10 GPa/mm. For such uncommon stressing conditions, prediction of cracking risk becomes very complex and non-local fatigue approaches must be adopted. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate how non-local strategies, such as "critical distance", developed for medium stress gradient conditions such as "notch" configurations, were transposed to predict fretting cracking risk. Elastic crack nucleation conditions of a 35 Ni Cr Mo 16 low alloyed steel at 10 E 6 cycles have been identified for various cylinder pad radius, contact pressure and fatigue stress conditions. The experimental crack nucleation conditions were then compared to predictions from analytical simulations coupling uni-axial and Crossland's multiaxial fatigue descriptions. The local "hot-spot" analysis systematically overestimated cracking risk and induced more than 30 % error with respect to the experimental values. The non-local "critical distance method" based on a constant length scale value still displayed more than 10 % dispersion suggesting that a non-constant "critical distance" approach must be considered. By expressing the critical distance evolution as a function of the hydrostatic stress gradient operating next to the stress hot-spot, dispersion was reduced below 5 %. Established for the Crossland's stress invariant formulation, this tendency is confirmed by comparing McDiarmid and MWCM critical plane fatigue approaches...|$|E

In addition, impact of severe fatigue on {{quality of life and}} correlates of fatigue severity were examined. METHODS: AYAs with cancer (n = 83) completed questionnaires including the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS-fatigue), Quality of Life (QoL) -Cancer Survivor, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (reflecting psychological distress), and the Cancer Worry Scale (reflecting fear of cancer recurrence or progression). RESULTS: The vast majority of participants had been treated with chemotherapy (87 %) and had no active treatment at the time of participation (73. 5 %). Prevalence of severe fatigue (CIS-fatigue score >/= 35) in AYAs with cancer (48 %, n = 40 / 83) was significantly higher in comparison with matched population-based controls (20 %, n = 49 / 249; p <. 001). Severely fatigued AYAs with cancer reported lower QoL compared to non-severely fatigued AYAs with cancer (p <. 05). Female gender, being unemployed, higher disease stage (III-IV) at diagnosis, receiving active treatment at the time of study participation, being treated with palliative intent, having had radiotherapy, higher fear of recurrence or progression, and higher psychological distress were significantly correlated with fatigue severity (p <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Severe fatigue based on a validated cut-off score was highly prevalent in this group of AYAs with cancer.

40|$|AbstractFretting fatigue is a {{critical}} loading that appears on many structures such as the blade/disk contact of aircraft engines. It is characterized by small displacements between two bodies, one of which has an applied bulk stress. This phenomenon has been studied {{for a long time}} and induces damages which critically reduce the fatigue resistance. Fretting stressing are multi-axial and above all characterized by very severe stress gradient conditions. Besides, significant contact plastic deformations can be activated for LCF conditions which again complicate the predictions. To address this aspect a combined experimental â modeling analysis has been developed on a well known a Ti- 6 V- 4 Al alloy. Using an original double actuator fretting fatigue apparatus, the fretting fatigue cracking endurance of a cylinder/plane contact from 10 E 4 to 10 E 7 cycles was determined keeping constant the partial slip fretting loading (i. e. Q/P= 0. 32) and varying the <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing</b> (700 MPa<Ïmax< 50 MPa, R= 0. 01). This research shows that the fretting fatigue crack nucleation endurance (bCN= 70 Î¼m) can be predicted using a basic Crossland's stress invariant multi-axial fatigue description if the cyclic elasto-plastic (ep) response of the material is conveniently integrated in the FEM simulation, the stress gradient effect is taken into account by considering a stress averaging strategy defined on a âV= 37 Î¼m cubic size previously calibrated from plain fretting experiments and finally if the ratio of tensile and shear fatigue limit is not assumed constant but expressed as a function of the loading cycles (Ï- 1 (N) /Ï- 1 (N)). Using this complete analysis the crack nucleation endurance from 10 E 4 - 10 E 7 cycle is predicted with an error smaller than 10 %. A parametric study shows that if the Ï- 1 /Ï- 1 ratio is assumed constant, defined at the fatigue limit conditions, the endurance predictions in LCF and most of the HCF domains are dangerously non conservative. Alternatively the application of plain elastic stress description leads to over conservative predictions when significant plastic accommodations are activated (N< 2 104 cycles) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} on the measurement of residual stress in metals and the effect of shot peening has been followed by a critical analysis of the layer removal method developed by Heyn, and Sachs and Espey, and later refined by Foppl. Some improvements on Foppl's method were made possible by the use of a computer for curve fitting. An analysis of the distribution of the radial residual stress in the plastic zone after shot peening has shown it to be sufficiently small to enable the stress system to be treated as a biaxial one without loss of accuracy. The optimum heat treatment conditions after peening, for maximum fatigue strength, were established, applied to shot peened cylindrical bars, and the distributions of hardness and residual stress in them determined. The core and surface hardnesses were then reproduced uniformly throughout torsional fatigue specimens and the effect of the different hardness levels on the fatigue strength evaluated. A third level of hardness was likewise investigated and the effect of shot peening on the fatigue strength of steels tempered to these three hardness levels was established. The effect of cyclical <b>fatigue</b> <b>stressing</b> upon the stress distribution due to shot peening, for levels of applied stress below and above the elastic limit, has shown that whereas the lower stresses had no effect, once the elastic limit of the matrix at the surface was exceeded, a considerable falling off of beneficial residual stress in the surface occurred, but it still maintained its original value 0. 003 in below the surface. It has been shown that the point of maximum principal tensile stress in a shot peened and externally loaded torsion bar is about 0. C ' 5 in below the surface, and that as a result, there is no deleterious effect due to the presence of shot peening indentations which are stress raisers. Removal of such marks by polishing, therefore, in no way influenced fatigue performance. A study of the separate effects of residual stress and hardness increase due to cold work during shot peening has shown that the increase in fatigue strength is mainly and sometimes completely due to beneficial residual stress, although under certain conditions {{a small part of the}} benefit may be due to an increase in hardness...|$|E
