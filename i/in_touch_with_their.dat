25|$|A two-year Massey University {{survey of}} 30,000 people, {{published}} in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results {{were consistent with}} those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to stay <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.|$|E

500|$|To {{prevent the}} serious renewal of warfare in the spring, it was {{considered}} essential to replace Marlborough with a general {{more in touch with}} the Queen's ministers and less <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> allies. To do this, Harley (newly created Earl of Oxford) and St John first needed to bring charges of corruption against the Duke, completing the anti-Whig, anti-war picture that Jonathan Swift was already presenting to a credulous public through his pamphleteering, notably in his Conduct of the Allies (1711). The means to achieve Marlborough's fall had already been put in train when the Ministry had set up a Parliamentary [...] "Commission for the taking, examining and stating the public accounts of the Kingdom", to report on alleged irregularities during the war.|$|E

500|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} as a mass organization, formed around a core of prewar officers. Home Army soldiers fell into three groups.

The third, largest group were [...] "part-time members": [...] sympathizers who led [...] "double lives" [...] under their real names in their real homes, received no payment for their services, stayed <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> undercover unit commanders but were seldom mustered for operations, as the Home Army planned to use them only during a planned nationwide rising.|$|E
500|$|This {{depiction}} {{not only}} links the Athsheans to their environment, but gives primacy {{to the forest}} {{over the rest of}} the natural ecosystem. The Athsheans' clans are named after trees, and their highly decentralized social structure is constructed in a way that resembles their ecosystem. To the Athsheans, being a mentally healthy person is equivalent to being <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> roots, which are closely linked to their ecosystem. In contrast, the Terrans' behavior, such as rape and murder, is attributed to their leaving [...] "their roots behind them". In the Athshean language the word for [...] "forest" [...] is also the word for [...] "world", showing the dependence of the Athshean culture upon the forest. In contrast, the Terrans ignorance of the ecology of the planet has already denuded one island in the archipelago, and is damaging the rest of the planet. Davidson sees the forest as a waste of space, and wishes to turn it into farmland.|$|E

[...] Alternative Addiction wrote that upon hearing the first chord, fans would [...] "immediately recognize" [...] McMahon's growth as a songwriter. IGN writer Jesse Lord noted that while second albums often fall into a sophomore slump, North leaves fan with [...] "purely good music to enjoy." [...] He mentioned that McMahon's piano [...] "blends in with the band so much better" [...] compared to Leaving Through the Window, coming across as [...] "feel natural, [...] not contrived."
