5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

On the second day, Langer and Matthew Hayden {{accumulated}} 110 {{for the first}} wicket, and runs <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> flowing as the Australians made 402 in a day - Brad Haddin top-scoring with 94, Jason Gillespie making an unbeaten 53 including two sixes, while Nadeem Malik got the best bowling figures three wickets for 78. Ali, meanwhile, was punished, to end with 124 conceded runs in 20 overs.|$|E

25|$|Kent, as expected, beat Glamorgan, {{but were}} worried on occasion. Having been shaken early on as Glamorgan dug out four early wickets, Kent were lifted by a 267-run {{partnership}} between Darren Stevens (who made 208) and Andrew Hall (133) which helped them {{along the way}} to a final first-innings score of 587, with Min Patel taking 55 balls for a 64 from number nine. Six Glamorgan players were then out in single figures, Amjad Khan taking three for 68, but number three David Hemp stood tall with an unbeaten 171. Glamorgan were 188 for 9 at one point on day two, but survived to stumps to 236 for 9, and <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> going - their number 11, Huw Waters, made 34 from 192 balls, and he added 118 with Hemp, for the second-highest stand of the match.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Anii" [...] {{was chosen}} in May 1979 by the Anii people as the {{official}} name for the language {{because it is a}} word that is common to all the Anii dialects.

25|$|Mongolians {{do not use}} {{surnames}} in the {{way that}} most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics – then called ovog, now called etsgiin ner – are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in genitive case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial – Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj guai – Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.|$|E
25|$|They started positively, riding {{their luck}} and good favour with the umpires – {{a number of}} lbw appeals were turned down {{both before and after}} tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic pace-man's short-ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, {{suggesting}} that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, there was nowhere to hide for England, and not even an unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day, England powered on, Brunt staking her claim for Player of the Match with a vital, {{powerful}} 52 - her first Test fifty - as she eked out 83 runs with Guha for the tenth wicket, Guha making 31 not out. Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a duck, and wickets <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership {{for the seventh}} wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand {{at the close of}} day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper Julia Price with successive deliveries, and all that was left was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to Jane Smit and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 not out, while slow left arm bowler Clare Connor ended with the bowling analysis of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111.|$|E

500|$|The {{offensive}} line was frequently shuffled due to injuries, with left guard Matt Slauson playing some games at center and right guard Kyle Long moving to tackle. The former alternated between guard and center during the season, playing weeks seven to nine and sixteen at center. At left tackle, second-year player Charles Leno, Jr. started 13 games after taking over for an injured Jermon Bushrod; Gase stated, [...] "He {{had a little}} bit of a rough start, but he <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> working and then when he got the opportunity at left tackle, he took full advantage of it." ...|$|E

She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience.
