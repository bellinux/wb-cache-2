5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E

The conventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (coal, oil and gas) are unfortunately the biggest polluters of the environment. The aforementioned <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which are responsible for global warming and ozone layer depletion.

The biggest advantage of using renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> is the fact that these <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> will never run out and they also do not pollute the environment as their more conventional counterparts. With more research being conducted into better ways of storing the power trapped from the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and the relative difficulty of obtaining the ever-depleting conventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> the future for renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> definitely looks better {{than at any time in}} the pastM.

5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are {{more closely related to}} those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both.
