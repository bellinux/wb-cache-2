5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, {{the diesel}} engine was {{enlarged}} to 1.8L, whilst the entry level 1.1L and 1.3L models were updated with the redesigned HCS {{version of the}} Kent/Valencia family introduced for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed electronic fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4L engine.|$|E
25|$|The IS 250, IS 350 and IS F {{feature a}} D-4 (IS250) or D-4S (IS350 and IS F) direct <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> with direct fuel {{injectors}} (D-4 and D-4S) and port fuel injectors (D-4S only). Certain Asian markets feature the IS 300 (GSE22) without direct injection.|$|E
25|$|Four petrol engines with multi point <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> were available, {{as well as}} one {{indirect}} injection diesel and three common rail turbocharged diesel engines with intercooler (JTD and MultiJet).

25|$|Yugo 45 {{derivative}} {{models have}} included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a carburetor {{until well into the}} 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were introduced beginning with the GVX-EFI (an electronic fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system),</b> which featured a 1300 cc engine.|$|E
25|$|Petrol-fuelled Range Rovers were {{fitted with}} {{carburettors}} until 1986, {{when they were}} replaced by Lucas electronic fuel injection, improving both performance and fuel economy. The Lucas <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> continued to evolve {{over the next several}} years, culminating in the 1990 to 1995 Lucas 14CUX. Some export markets retained carburettors, with the original Zenith/Stromberg manufactured units being replaced by Skinners Union (SU)-manufactured items.|$|E
25|$|The X180 cars {{inherited}} most {{of their}} mechanical components from the earlier HC Esprit and Turbo Esprit, although the name for the forced induction model was now Esprit Turbo. 1988 model year North American Esprit Turbos kept the Citroën transaxle and Bosch fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> used in the previous model year. Other X180s received a new Renault UN-1 transaxle, which necessitated a move to outboard rear brakes.|$|E

25|$|From 1973 the LC10W engines also {{received}} Suzuki's SRIS (Suzuki Recycle <b>Injection</b> <b>System),</b> {{a method for}} lowering visible exhaust smoke by collecting and burning residual oil/gas lying {{in the bottom of}} the crank chambers. This was first seen on the Suzuki GT750, GT550, and GT380 motorcycles. In an effort to reduce CO, HC, and NOx emissions, the EPIC (Exhaust Port Ignition Cleaner) system was also installed.|$|E
25|$|The opening laps saw cars {{slide off}} the circuit, {{but he would}} never get the choice to join the chaos, as his fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> failed on the very first lap. In fact the entire Japanese {{contingent}} suffered a dreadful race, especially when both Katayama and rookie Taki Inoue then aquaplaned into the pit wall {{at the end of}} lap three in separate incidents. Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.|$|E
25|$|At {{the price}} of {{increased}} complication for a high pressure diesel type <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> fuel consumption in the same range as small pre-chamber automotive and industrial diesels has been demonstrated with Curtiss-Wright's stratified charge multi-fuel engines, while preserving Wankel rotary advantages Unlike a piston and overhead valve engine, there are no valves which can float at higher rpm causing loss of performance. The Wankel is a more effective design at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no cylinder head.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the 200, which was equipped with a Stromberg or Pierburg carburetor but was not available to the United States, fuel injection was standard, and the engines incorporated features that maximised performance. The most notable such feature was the addition of an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system which, in conjunction with a semi-electronic fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> could make the engine run more efficiently. This improved fuel consumption while simultaneously meeting stricter emission regulations. Mercedes-Benz's four-wheel drive system, the 4Matic was first introduced on the W124 in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{core cooling}} (ECCS) is performed by a redundant high-pressure safety <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> {{with a total of}} three strands (one in the NANO). The two steam generators are provided with water by two main feeding pumps. If they fail, feeding is taken over by one of the security systems: a double-stranded auxiliary feedwater system or one of the two emergency feedwater systems, one of which part of the bunkerised NANO. Finally, in case of problems with the cooling, two containment spray systems are entrusted with the removal of excessive heat and pressure by condensation of the resulting steam.|$|E
25|$|The <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years {{as part of the}} Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2586MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1Hz, with an RF frequency of 500Hz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 {{emissions}} standards-compliant {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3–4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are bigger power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel <b>Injection</b> <b>System</b> that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam <b>injection</b> <b>system.</b> In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|E
50|$|Open-loop fuel <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{had already}} {{improved}} cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution and engine operation {{over a wide}} temperature range, but did not offer further scope to sufficient control fuel/air mixtures, {{in order to further}} reduce exhaust emissions. Later closed-loop fuel <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> improved the air-fuel mixture control with an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. Although not part of the injection control, a catalytic converter further reduces exhaust emissions.|$|R
