40|$|SUMMARY – Spain {{has become}} the EU leader, in terms of <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> with a {{production}} of approximately two million tons. This {{is due to the}} Spanish agronomic potential and to the adaptation of the dehydrating industries to the requirements of the EU Common Organisation of <b>Dried</b> <b>Fodder</b> Markets. The Spanish climatic conditions favour a dehydration system, which combines the artificial drying techniques together with the exploitation of the solar radiation which partially makes up for the high cost of irrigation. There are around 170, 000 ha in Spain dedicated to fodder transformation, principally located {{in the area of the}} Ebro Valley (80 % of the total surface). However, production in Castilla-La Mancha and cultivation in the north-east of Spain have recently also acquired importance, with lucern...|$|E
40|$|The {{derogation}} {{from the}} EU Organic Regulatory Board to allow organic pig and poultry producers to include up to 5 % non-organic feed within their rations {{was due to}} finish {{at the end of}} December 2014. This has now been extended to 31 December 2017 when it will become compulsory under EU Regulations (EC) no 889 / 2008 to provide all organic livestock with feed derived from organic origin. A further requirement of the regulation is that at least 20 % of the feed should originate from the farm unit or if this is not possible from the same region. The organic regulations also dictate that roughage, fresh or <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> or silage be added to the daily ration for poultry. In addition, poultry must be given access to pasture to complement their dietary requirements and express natural behaviours.

40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the cereals intervention price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, starch, potatoes, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder,</b> seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, starch potatoes, grain legumes, rice, seeds, <b>dried</b> <b>fodder.</b> As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into payment entitlements in order to facilitate their transfer. Each entitlement will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive.

40|$|To save poor rusted timothy hay, and let better fodder go {{to waste}} in the corn fields, {{has always been the}} rule in the west. Here are a few facts which are worth considering. If a corn crop is cut when the ears are well dented, (nearly ripe) the fodder will contain {{digestible}} nutrients per ton as follows: Albuminoids 66 pounds; Carbohydrates 868 pounds, and fat 20 pounds. To cut it earlier, would cause it to be less nutritious. On a preceding page of this bulletin we stated, that digestible albuminoids and fats were worth 3. 343 cents per pound, and that carbohydrates were worth 0. 6 cents per pound in Iowa. Therefore, a little figuring will show, that a ton of good corn fodder is worth $ 8. 08 or $ 16. 16 per acre, as average corn fields in Iowa yield two tons of field <b>dried</b> <b>fodder</b> per acre. In former years, the average yield of hay from timothy meadows has not exceeded one and one half tons per acre. The digestible nutrients in one ton of good timothy hay are as follows: Albuminoids 73. 4 pounds; carbohydrates 825 pounds, and fat 20. 6 pounds; therefore a ton of timothy hay is worth $ 8. 08 per ton, or $ 12. 12 per acre. We find that there is no difference between the values of a ton of good timothy hay and a ton of corn fodder; but on account of the greater yield of the latter, an acre of corn fodder is worth $ 4. 04 more than the hay from an acre of timothy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and <b>dried</b> <b>fodder</b> sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|E

For small and medium size local breed farms, the coefficient for <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> is positive and significant at 5 % level and labor is positive and significant at 5 % level {{in the case of}} small size cross breed. For small and medium size local breed farms, the coefficient for miscellaneous are positive and significant at 10 % level. There is difference between the present and optimum levels of inputs. The optimum levels of inputs with respect to concentrate are 30. 21 quintal and 24. 82 quintals for medium and small size cross breed farms, respectively. For <b>dry</b> <b>fodder,</b> the optimum is 32. 70 quintals and 12. 84 quintal for medium size cross and local breed farms, respectively. where as, 8. 88 quintals for small size local breed farms. Green fodder, the optimum level is 10. 88 quintals for medium size local breed farms. The optimum level for labor is 403. 12 man day for small size cross breed farms. For miscellaneous cost the optimum levels are 228. 54 Birr and 336. 47 Birr for medium and small size local bred farms, respectively. The C:B results indicated that cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 02) than local breed farms (1. 0 : 2. 18). Both medium and small categories of cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 45 and 1. 0 : 2. 74, respectively). In local breed medium size farms were profitable (1. 0 : 2. 19). The ratio of break-even milk output from the actual milk production for cross breed and local breed cows owning farms needed 13 % of the actual milk {{production and}} 18 % additional milk production over the actual milk production to cover fixed cost, respectively. Cross breed small and medium size farms needed 8 % and 11 % milk output and local breed small and medium size farms requires additional 31 % and 14 % over the actual milk production. In conclusion, dairy cow's owner should be advised to use the optimum levels inputs and replace their indigenous cow with cross breed cow.

25|$|Prosopis cineraria is most {{important}} top feed species providing nutritious and highly palatable green as well as <b>dry</b> <b>fodder,</b> which is readily eaten by camels, cattle, sheep and goats, constituting a major feed requirement of desert livestock. Locally it is called Loong. Pods are locally called sangar or sangri. The dried pods locally called Kho-Kha are eaten. Dried pods also form rich animal feed, which is liked by all livestock. Green pods also form rich animal feed, which is liked by drying the young boiled pods. They are also used as famine food and known even to prehistoric man. Even the bark, having an astringent bitter taste, was reportedly eaten during the severe famine of 1899 and 1939. Pod yield is nearly 1.4 quintals of pods/ha with a variation of 10.7% in dry locations.|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus (P) is {{the most}} {{limiting}} soil nutrient in the sandy soils of Niger and farmers rarely use chemical fertilizers in producing pearl millet and cowpea. A 3 -yr {{study was conducted in}} farmer's fields at two locations in South Western Niger to investigate yield response of six cowpea cultivars to applied P-fertilizer (0, 8, 16 kg ha(- 1)) when intercropped with millet. Significant yield differences were found between cultivars for their seed and <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> yield at all rates of applied P. Cultivars responded differently to the application of P. Millet grain was more than doubled with the addition of 8 to 16 kg P ha(- 1). Cowpea cultivars did not have significant differential effect on millet yields. Cowpea cultivars differed significantly in the accumulation of P in fodder with the highest yielding cultivars taking up more P than the low yielding ones. The results have important implications for breeding and selection of cowpea cultivars that are adapted to a range of fertility levels...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{patterns}} of food consumption, linked to economic growth, and coupled with demographic changes are resulting in {{increased demand for}} livestock products in developing countries. However, {{one of the key}} constraints of the dairy development in resource poor areas of India is inadequate supply of fodder. Insufficiency of fodder inflicts very low level of animal productivity and a meager amount of marketable surplus of milk. Due to inflating food demand for burgeoning human population expansion of area under cultivated fodder is virtually impossible. Thus, livestock are heavily dependent upon crop residues as the main source of fodder in much of India. Mitigating scarcity of <b>dry</b> <b>fodder</b> and managing availability of green fodder round the year is a serious challenge for the livestock keepers as majority are marginal and small holders unable to produce and store livestock feed and forage and face acute shortage during certain periods. The paper deals with the aspects of fodder production and marketing in one of the poorest sates in India, Bihar. ...|$|R
