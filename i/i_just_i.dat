2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter. Although many fans have made their own interpretations of the song, a common theory has been that the song is about someone {{receiving}} a letter and finding his or her brother had died overseas in war, cited from the lyrics in the Live at the Garden version [...] "I don't know whether my brother will be coming home in a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. <b>I</b> <b>just,</b> <b>I</b> don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him when I go to bed, and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E

In Dr. Johnston's Life--which my father is always reading--I like to read about Sir Joshua Reynolds best: I think he is the best gentleman of all in the book. My! wouldn't I like to paint a picture like Lord Heathfield in the National Gallery! Wouldn't <b>I</b> <b>just!</b> <b>I</b> think I would sooner have done that, than have fought at Gibraltar. And those Three Graces--oh, aren't they graceful! And that Cardinal Beaufort at Dulwich!--it frightens me so, I daren't look at it. Wasn't Reynolds a clipper, that's all! and wasn't Rubens a brick! He was an ambassador, and Knight of the Bath; so was Vandyck. And Titian, and Raphael, and Velasquez?--I'll just trouble you to show me better gentlemen than them, Uncle Charles." ...|$|E

50|$|Dushku: The {{idea for}} the Faith {{spin-off}} just kind of came up in discussion because everyone really, I think, was feeling like this show's going to end and {{there are all these}} fans who love it so much and who love these characters and so, if possible, how could we extend that? I just personally felt like... It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I wouldn't have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following the show, I think that those would have been really big boots to fill. I {{think it would have been}} compared to Buffy. And just in terms of me, I've played that character on and off for five years now and I've changed a lot and while the character of Faith changed when I came back because I've changed, I felt like maybe it was time to... I mean, I love Faith. She's my girl and she's been really good to me, but I kind of just wanted to try something else. Purely that, because it had nothing to do with me not trusting Joss and his team of writers, who I just think are amazing. Tim Minear and Drew Goddard, and Marti Noxon and all these people, they're so talented and it had nothing to do with me doubting that they could make this show amazing, but <b>I</b> <b>just...</b> <b>I</b> don't know, sometimes you have to go with your gut, and my gut was telling me that I maybe needed to try something else that was just different.|$|E
