5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level virtualization {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host. It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own <b>hostname</b> and IP address. It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E

25|$|Hostnames and IP {{addresses}} are {{not required}} to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in virtual hosting, in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single <b>hostname</b> may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate fault tolerance and load distribution to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.|$|E

Within Example, the devices are addressed by their <b>hostnames.</b> The domain names of the devices would be saturn.example and jupiter.example, respectively. If 'example' is registered as a second-level domain name in the Internet, e.g. example.net, the hosts may be addressed by the fully qualified domain names saturn.example.net and jupiter.example.net.|$|R
25|$|Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge {{from the}} early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the {{freeware}} NetFoss Telnet FOSSIL driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to dial an IP address or <b>hostname</b> via Telnet, rather than dialing a real POTS phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with DOSEMU (DOS emulator).|$|E
25|$|The {{header section}} {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The identification field {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried <b>hostname.</b> Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The question section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E

That service will automatically resolve the private IP addresses of link-local Macintosh computers running MacOS and mobile devices running iOS if [...]local is appended to their <b>hostnames.</b> In addition, Bonjour devices will use those [...]local <b>hostnames</b> when advertising services to DNS Service Discovery clients.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to resolving <b>hostnames</b> in the ICANN root, OpenNIC also resolves <b>hostnames</b> in OpenNIC-operated namespaces, {{as well as}} within namespaces with which peering agreements have been established. Some OpenNIC recursive servers (Tier 2 servers) {{are known for their}} high speeds and low latency, relative to other more widely used DNS recursors, as well as their anonymizing or no-logging policies. Tier 2 servers are operated by community volunteers across a multitude of geographic locations.|$|R
5000|$|While most rDNS entries {{only have}} one PTR record, DNS does not {{restrict}} the number. Multiple PTR records are used, for example, when a web server supports many virtual hosts i.e. multiple <b>hostnames</b> then resolve to a single address, and multiple <b>hostnames</b> will be returned for a PTR lookup for that shared address. However, DNS lookups typically occur over UDP, and since UDP has a limited message size, in extreme cases, multiple PTRs could cause a DNS response to exceed those UDP limits.|$|R

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to use a DDNS [...] "push" [...] request to automatically send an amateur call sign in plain text (ASCII) every 10 minutes. This requires that a computers <b>hostname</b> be set to the call sign of the amateur operator and that the DHCP servers lease time be set to {{less than or equal}} to 10 minutes. With this method implemented the computer will send a DNS [...] "push" [...] request that includes the local computers <b>hostname</b> every time the DHCP lease is renewed. This method is supported by all modern operating systems including but not limited to Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, and Linux.|$|E
2500|$|RDATA is data of type-specific relevance, {{such as the}} IP {{address for}} address records, or the {{priority}} and <b>hostname</b> for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but [...] "unknown" [...] record types must not (RFC 3597).|$|E

50|$|Any {{domain name}} {{can also be}} a <b>hostname,</b> as long as the {{restrictions}} mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both en.wikipedia.org and wikipedia.org are hostnames because they both have IP addresses assigned to them. The domain name pmtpa.wikimedia.org is not a <b>hostname</b> since it does not have an IP address (as of now), but rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org is a <b>hostname.</b> A <b>hostname</b> may be a domain name, if it is properly organized into the domain name system. A domain name may be a <b>hostname</b> if it has been assigned to an Internet host and associated with the host's IP address.|$|E

50|$|Hostnames are human-readable nicknames that {{correspond}} to the address of a device connected to a network. They are used by various naming systems, e.g., Network Information Service (NIS), Domain Name System (DNS), Server Message Block (SMB) {{and the meaning of}} <b>hostname</b> varies according to the naming system used. A <b>hostname</b> meaningful to a Microsoft NetBIOS workgroup may be an invalid Internet <b>hostname.</b>|$|E
50|$|On the Internet, a <b>hostname</b> is {{a domain}} name {{assigned}} to a host computer. This is usually {{a combination of the}} host's local name with its parent domain's name. For example, en.wikipedia.org consists of a local <b>hostname</b> (en) and the domain name wikipedia.org. This kind of <b>hostname</b> is translated into an IP address via the local hosts file, or the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. It is possible for a single host computer to have several hostnames; but generally the operating system of the host prefers to have one <b>hostname</b> that the host uses for itself.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} geolocating Internet routers, using a {{methodology}} for extracting and decoding geography-related strings from fully qualified domain names (<b>hostnames).</b> We first compiled an extensive dictionary associating geographic strings (e. g., airport codes) with geophysical locations. We then searched a large set of router <b>hostnames</b> for these strings, assuming each autonomous naming domain uses geographic hints consistently within that domain. We used topology and performance data continually collected by our global measurement infrastructure to discern whether a given hint appears to co-locate different <b>hostnames</b> {{in which it is}} found. Finally, we generalized geolocation hints into domainspecific rule sets. We generated a total of 1, 711 rules covering 1, 398 different domains and validated them using domain-specific ground truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike previous efforts which relied on labor-intensive domain-specific manual analysis, we automate our process for inferring the domain specific heuristics, substantially advancing the state-of-the-art of methods for geolocating Internet resources...|$|R
