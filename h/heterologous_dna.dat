50|$|The {{combined}} {{resistance to}} novobiocin and oxacillin is hypothesized to have originated from a simultaneous introduction of genes controlling {{the resistance to}} the two. These genes were {{believed to have been}} acquired originally through <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> from a methicillin-resistant strain of one of the novobiocin-resistant species belonging to the S. sciuri or the S. saprophyticus groups. The larger genome size of the SHN compared to that of S. hominis hominis {{may be the result of}} the acquiring of <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA.</b> This new, divergent strain was first described in 1998, and was first implicated in causing bacteremia in 2002. Another hypothesis is the insertion of the mec A gene and its flanking sequence into the chromosome of SHN might have affected the expression of a closely linked gene, which converted the host to become novobiocin-resistant.|$|E

5000|$|NdeI {{is useful}} in {{generating}} <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> construct because it contains the start codon ATG. It therefore can be in used in some expression vectors, {{such as those in}} the pET series of vectors, for the ligation of the start of a gene when making an expression construct. Note however that NdeI generates only a two-base overhang and therefore has a lower melting temperature than other restriction enzymes that generate a four-base overhang. [...] It has a lower ligation efficiency, since ligation is affected by the ability of the ends to anneal and a two-base overhang has a significantly lower melting temperature compared to a 4-base overhang. Ligation of NdeI-generated ends is therefore best performed with higher ligase concentration with a longer ligation time, whether at room temperature, 14-16°C, or at 4°C.|$|E

This study demonstrated the efficacy of a transplantation approach that ultimately allows for an enriched population of HSPCs expressing a single copy of a CCR5 miRNA. Since positive selection of modified cells is likely to be insufficient below the threshold they found of at least 70% of the HIV target cells resulting in gene modification from efficient maintenance of CD34+ T cell and a low viral titer, the findings show evidence that clinical protocols of HIV gene therapy require a selective enrichment of genetically targeted cells.|$|E

40|$|The Brn- 3 a {{transcription}} factor has two distinct activation domains located, respectively, at the N-terminus and the C-terminus (coincident with the DNA binding POU domain) which {{differ in their}} effects on different target promoters. To analyze whether these regions could function when linked to a <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> binding domain, they were each linked to the GAL 4 DNA binding domain. Here we show that the N-terminal domain constitutes a discrete activation domain which can function when linked to a <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> binding domain. Under these conditions this domain can activate at different distances upstream of the transcriptional start site but does not do so when bound downstream of the start site. In contrast, the POU activation domain cannot activate transcription when delivered to DNA via a <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> binding domain, but can function when linked to such a domain if bound to DNA via its own appropriate binding site. The reasons for this {{difference between these two}} domains are discussed in terms of the ability of the POU domain to bind to single stranded DNA and serve as a site for protein-protein interactions...|$|E

These results indicate that as in transformation of Bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine in phage T 6 DNA considerably decreases the interaction of such DNA with competent cells of the Challis strain.

40|$|We {{describe}} a genetic {{system in which}} transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant DNA into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetM) 6001 (omega 6001). The element containing the recombinant DNA was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. When Escherichia coli plasmid pDP 36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5. 9 kilobases of <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. Genetic analysis showed that in {{a fraction of the}} erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> caused inactivation of the tetM gene of omega 6001. By analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. It was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of S. pneumoniae, S. sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus faecalis. The omega 6001 -pDP 36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci.

Similar estimates of the amount of homology between the genomes of the two EHV- 1 subtypes were obtained by determining the maximum fraction of labeled viral DNA that could be made resistant to S 1 nuclease by hybridization with a large molar excess of the unlabeled, <b>heterologous</b> viral <b>DNA.</b> Analysis of the thermal stability of the subtype 1 -subtype 2 heteroduplex DNA indicated approximately 30 % base pair mismatching within the hybrid DNA molecules. Cross-hybridization of 32 P-labeled virion DNA to nitrocellulose blots of restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of each EHV- 1 subtype DNA indicated that the observed homology between the two viruses was nonuniformly distributed with the viral genome.

40|$|With the use {{of highly}} {{competent}} Haemophilus influenzae cells, {{it was possible to}} demonstrate the uptake of <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNAs.</b> However, these DNAs, as expected, were only 1 % or less as effective when competing for uptake with Haemophilus DNA. Escherichia coli DNA was removed from solution by competent cells to the extent expected if all the E. coli DNA particles contained at least one uptake recognition signal. The data were consistent with a model in which there was one uptake signal per 20 X 10 (6) to 30 X 10 (6) daltons of E. coli DNA. Since H. influenzae DNA has many more recognition signals, approximately one per 2 X 10 (6) daltons (Danner et al., Gene 77 : 311 - 318, 1980; K. Vogt and S. H.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{efficiency}} of transformation of pneumococcus and {{a strain of}} viridans streptococcus (strain D) to streptomycin resistance {{is influenced by the}} species in which the mutation to resistance occurred, {{as well as by the}} species in which the mutated gene has been replicated. Pneumococcus and streptococcus strain D transform in higher frequency with DNA that has been replicated in bacteria of the same species than with <b>DNA</b> from the <b>heterologous</b> species. However, the difference between the frequencies of interspecific and intraspecific transformation is much greater with pneumococcus as receptor than with streptococcus.

Pneumococcus is transformed in lower frequency by wholly <b>heterologous</b> (streptococcal) <b>DNA</b> than by DNA from streptococci that have replicated the pneumococcai Smr gene. Streptococcus behaves similarly in that wholly homologous (streptococcal) DNA transforms it more efficiently than when the transforming fragment contains a pneumococcal moiety.

40|$|Mammalian cell {{extracts}} {{have been}} shown to carry out damage-specific DNA repair synthesis induced by a variety of lesions, including those created by UV and cisplatin. Here, we show that a single psoralen interstrand cross-link induces DNA synthesis in both the damaged plasmid and a second homologous unmodified plasmid coincubated in the extract. The presence of the second plasmid strongly stimulates repair synthesis in the cross-linked plasmid. <b>Heterologous</b> <b>DNAs</b> also stimulate repair synthesis to variable extents. Psoralen monoadducts and double-strand breaks do not induce repair synthesis in the unmodified plasmid, indicating that such incorporation is specific to interstrand cross-links. This induced repair synthesis is consistent with previous evidence indicating a recombinational mode of repair for interstrand cross-links. DNA synthesis is compromised in extracts from mutants (deficient in ERCC 1, XPF, XRCC 2, and XRCC 3) which are all sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents but is normal in extracts from mutants (XP-A, XP-C, and XP-G) which are much less sensitive. Extracts from Fanconi anemia cells exhibit an intermediate to wild-type level of activity dependent upon the complementation group. The DNA synthesis deficit in ERCC 1 - and XPF-deficient extracts is restored by addition of purified ERCC 1 -XPF heterodimer. This system provides a biochemical assay for investigating mechanisms of interstrand cross-link repair and should also facilitate the identification and functional characterization of cellular proteins involved in repair of these lesions...|$|R
40|$|With {{simultaneous}} immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we {{have determined}} {{the organization of}} native and <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences relative to the cores of meiotic prophase chromosomes. The normal chromatin organization is demonstrated with probes of mouse sequences: a cosmid probe that identifies unique sequences and a 720 kb yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) probe that recognizes a specific region of the chromatin domain. The <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> consists of a 1. 8 Mb insertion of 40 tandem head-to-tail phage λ LIZ vectors and of 11. 4 Mb of bacterial/mouse DNA repeats. The lengthy λ insert is unusual {{in that it is}} not contained in the chromatin domain of chromosome 4 and in that it fails to form direct attachments to the chromosome core. The ends are attached indirectly, probably by means of the flanking mouse sequences. At late stages of meiotic prophase, while the terminal attachments remain the same, the λ DNA becomes highly compacted. Apparently, higher order condensation and core attachment are independent processes. The condensed inserts relax precociously at metaphase I. In the mouse heterozygous for the insert, the two sister inserts are usually merged, as are all four inserts in the homozygous mouse. Evidently chromatin loops with identical sequences can become associated during meiotic prophase. Mouse sequences within a <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNA</b> insert (repeats of bacterial plasmid pBR 322 with a mouse β-globin insert) were observed to restore some degree of core attachment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{sequence}} conservation in the chloroplast genome of higher plants has been investigated. Supercoiled chloroplast DNA, prepared from pea seedlings, was labeled in vitro {{and used as}} a probe in reassociation experiments with {{a high concentration of}} total DNAs extracted from several angiosperms, gymnosperms, and lower vascular plants. In each case the probe reassociation was accelerated, demonstrating that some chloroplast sequences have been highly conserved throughout the evolution of vascular plants. Only among the flowering plants were distinct levels of cross-reaction with the pea chloroplast probe evident; broad bean and barley exhibited the highest and lowest levels, respectively. With the hydroxylapatite assay these levels decreased with a decrease in probe fragment length (from 1, 860 to 735 bases), indicating that many conserved sequences in the chloroplast genome are separated by divergent sequences on a rather fine scale. Despite differences observed in levels of homology with the hydroxylapatite assay, S 1 nuclease analysis of heteroduplexes showed that outside of the pea family the extent of sequence relatedness between the probe and various <b>heterologous</b> <b>DNAs</b> is approximately the same: 30 %. In our interpretation, the fundamental changes in the chloroplast genome during angiosperm evolution involved the rearrangement of this 30 % with respect to the more rapidly changing sequences of the genome.

P., Shibata, T., DasGupta, C. & Radding, C. M. (1979) Nature (London) 281, 191 - 195]. In {{the presence}} of ATP and homologous circular single-stranded DNA, recA protein also unwinds circular duplex DNA that is nicked at a <b>heterologous</b> site.

Like synapsis itself, and unlike strand exchange which follows synapsis, unwinding is sensitive to inhibition by ADP. Because recA protein unwinds duplex DNA when neither the single-stranded DNA nor the duplex DNA has a free end in the region of homology, unwinding can be initiated or mediated by a synaptic structure that differs from that of a simple D loop. The paired circular single strand in the synaptic structure behaves like one strand of an under-wound helix because E. coli topoisomerase I can interwind it with its complement...|$|R
