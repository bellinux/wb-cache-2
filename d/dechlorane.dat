50|$|Some occupations expose {{workers to}} higher levels of {{halogenated}} flame retardants and their degradation products. A small study of U.S. foam recyclers and carpet installers, who handle padding often made from recycled polyurethane foam, showed elevated levels of flame retardants in their tissues. Workers in electronics recycling plants around the world also have elevated body levels of flame retardants relative to the general population. Environmental controls can substantially reduce this exposure, whereas workers in areas with little oversight can take in very high levels of flame retardants. Electronics recyclers in Guiyu, China, have some of the highest human body levels of PBDEs in the world. A study conducted in Finland determined the occupational exposure of workers to brominated flame retardants and chlorinated flame retardants (TBBPA, PBDEs, DBDPE, HBCD, Hexabromobenzene and <b>Dechlorane</b> plus). In 4 recycling sites of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), the study concluded that control measures implemented on site significantly reduced the exposure. Workers making products that contain flame retardants (such as vehicles, electronics, and baby products) may be similarly exposed. U.S. firefighters can have elevated levels of PBDEs and high levels of brominated furans, toxic degradation products of brominated flame retardants.|$|E

PBDEs, Dec- 602, Dec- 603 and DP were detected {{in all the}} species, whereas HBB, PBEB, DBDPE and Dec- 604 were not detected in any sample. σPBDE and σDechlorane levels ranged from 1. 40 to 90. 7, and from 0. 77 to 260. ng/g. lw, respectively. BDE- 209 was the most abundant BDE congener in almost all the species, whereas Dec- 602 was the predominant among <b>dechloranes.</b> In general, levels of PBDEs and <b>dechloranes</b> were similar and even higher for <b>dechloranes,</b> probably indicating {{the increasing use of}} <b>dechloranes</b> as a result of legal restrictions on PBDEs. In both cases, the most contaminated specie was the white stork. Using stable isotope characterization, differences among species and possible biomagnification processes were also evaluated. PBDE levels increased as the trophic position increased, showing biomagnification capacity. The same behavior was observed for Dec- 602 and Dec- 603; however, DP levels were not linearly correlated with trophic level.

40|$|In recent years, <b>Dechloranes</b> {{have been}} widely {{detected}} in the environment around the world. However, understanding and knowledge of <b>Dechloranes</b> in remote regions, such as the Arctic, remain lacking. Therefore, the concentrations of 5 <b>Dechloranes</b> in surface seawater, sediment, soil, moss, and dung collected from Ny-Alesund in the Arctic were measured with the concentrations 93 pg/L, 342, 325, 1. 4, and 258 pg/g, respectively, which were much lower than those in Asian and European regions. The mean ratios of anti-Dechlorane Plus (DP) to total DP (f(anti)) in seawater, sediment, soil, moss, dung, and atmospheric samples were 0. 36, 0. 21, 0. 18, 0. 27, 0. 66, and 0. 43, respectively.

In general, these emerging BFRs have much lower concentrations than polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and <b>dechloranes.</b> Inventories of the five BFRs named above, given on a logarithm basis, were found to decrease linearly with the increasing latitude of the sampling locations, but with weaker statistics than those previously reported for the <b>dechloranes.</b> Logarithm of surface fluxes, on the other hand, {{was found to be}} a better parameter in correlating with the longitude.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are toxic chemicals that adversely affect {{human health and}} the environment around the world. The Stockholm Convention defined four criteria of POPs for persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range transport and toxicity. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) are the most used flame retardants (FRs) that are POPs regulated under the Stockholm Convention. Their production has been banned in Europe and North America. Hence new brominated FRs (BFRs) are used as substitutes; as well as chlorinated FRs, such as <b>dechloranes.</b> Over the years, presence of POPs has been detected in remote areas like Arctic and Antarctic. Although there are very few human impacts because of the geographic isolation and extreme climate, researches have demonstrated that POPs have reached this isolated continent and ocean area unfortunately. The present study investigates the occurrence of PBDEs, emerging BFRs and <b>dechloranes</b> in a total of 31 samples of 2 species of seals (Mirounga leonina and Arctocephalus gazella) collected in Livingston Island and Penguin Island (Antarctica). The samples correspond to different tissues: muscle, nervous system, fat and fur. The main aims of this study are: 1) to detect the presence of emerging FRs in these samples which can prove the transport capacity of long range with risks to the environment and living beings; 2) to assess the degree of exposure of these seals in this area with the levels of FRs found and compare them with other studies published in areas of the Antarctic. PBDEs, <b>dechloranes</b> and HBCDs were detected in some samples with the same order of magnitude (low ng/g lipid weight (lw)). In terms of examined PBDEs, BDE- 28 and BDE- 47 were the predominant pollutants in fat and fins samples with lower concentrations comparing with previous studies. As for <b>dechloranes,</b> Dec 602 showed the presence in fins, fat and nervous system samples while anti-DP was only detected in fat samples.

40|$|Emerging {{chemical}} contaminants [e. g. toxic metals speciation, {{flame retardants}} (FRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), among others], {{that have not}} been historically recognized as pollutants nor their toxicological hazards, are increasingly more present in the marine environment. Furthermore, the effects of environmental conditions (e. g. temperature and pH) on bioaccumulation and elimination mechanisms of these emerging contaminants in marine biota have been poorly studied until now. In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess, for the first time, the effect of warmer seawater temperatures (Δ = + 4 °C) and lower pH levels (Δ = − 0. 4 pH units), acting alone or combined, on the bioaccumulation and elimination of emerging FRs (<b>dechloranes</b> 602, 603 and 604, and TBBPA), inorganic arsenic (iAs), and PFCs (PFOA and PFOS) in two estuarine bivalve species (Mytilus galloprovincialis and Ruditapes philippinarum). Overall, results showed that warming alone or combined with acidification promoted the bioaccumulation of some compounds (i. e. <b>dechloranes</b> 602, 604, TBBPA), but also facilitated the elimination of others (i. e. iAs, TBBPA). Similarly, lower pH also resulted in higher levels of <b>dechloranes,</b> as well as enhanced iAs, PFOA and PFOS elimination. Data also suggests that, when both abiotic stressors are combined, bivalves' capacity to accumulate contaminants may be time-dependent, considering significantly drastic increase observed with Dec 602 and TBBPA, during the last 10 days of exposure, when compared to reference conditions. Such changes in contaminants' bioaccumulation/elimination patterns also suggest a potential increase of human health risks of some compounds, if the climate continues changing as forecasted. Therefore, this first study pointed out the urgent need for further research on the effects of abiotic conditions on emerging contaminants kinetics, to adequately estimate the potential toxicological hazards associated to these compounds and develop recommendations/regulations for their presence in seafood, considering the prevailing environmental conditions expected in tomorrow's ocean...|$|R

30|$|This study {{aims for}} {{reporting}} on the determination of selected organic contaminants in moss samples from Germany taken {{within the framework of}} the 2015 European moss survey. In the European moss survey programme, since 1990, every 5  years, moss have been sampled at up to about 7300 sites in up to 36 countries, among them Germany. Within the European moss survey programme, sampling, chemical determination of heavy metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005), as well as POP and POP-like substances (since 2010) in moss specimens, quality control and statistical evaluation were conducted according to a harmonized methodology [25]. In Germany, (persistent) organic pollutants in moss samples were to be determined for the first time within this programme in 2015. Therefore, this study aims for the determination of a wide range of organic pollutants to get insight of their extent of accumulation and distribution in moss from Germany. As some of these contaminants were also monitored in tree leaf samples within the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), accumulation in moss should be compared to that in tree leaves.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This review {{presents}} the currently used or promising flame retardant {{systems for the}} aliphatic polyamides. The largest applications are in electrical parts, with smaller usage in automotive and textiles. A polycyclic chlorohydrocarbon, <b>DECHLORANE</b> PLUS, is employed in low smoke formulations. Decabromodiphenyl ether has major use in polyamide 6. Alternative brominated additives include decabromodiphenylethane, polybrominated phenylindane, polymeric dibromophenylene oxide, polybrominated polystyrene and oligomeric glycidyl ethers of tetrabromobisphenol A, and polypentabromobenzyl acrylate. In non-reinforced polyamide 6, melamine cyanurate is effective. With glass reinforcements, some melamine pyro- or polyphosphates are useful. Polyamide 6 can be flame retarded with high loadings of magnesium hydroxide. Stabilized and coated red phosphorus is used in Europe and the Far East. A recent development {{is the use of}} aluminum dialkylphosphinate. In textile fiber, there has been some development of a built-in phosphinate.

40|$|Selected {{organochlorine}} pesticides (OCs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were analyzed in surficial fjord sediments collected {{down the length}} of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard in the Norwegian high Arctic.

Concentrations of legacy OCs, including both HCH isomers and chlordane showed a decreasing trend from the outer, seaward end of the fjord to the inner, glacier end of the fjord. Conversely, sediment concentrations of α- and β-endosulfan (0. 1 – 12. 5 pg g− 1 dw) increased from the outer fjord to the inner fjord. This contrasting pattern may be attributed to the influence of historical vs. contemporary sources of these chemicals to the fjord area, whereby the North Atlantic/West Spitzbergen oceanic current dominates the transport and input of the legacy OCs, whereas atmospheric deposition and meltwater runoff from the glaciers influence the inner fjord sediments for endosulfan. Interestingly, BDE- 209 and <b>Dechlorane</b> Plus did not reveal any clear spatial trend. It is plausible that both glacial runoff and oceanic current end members are playing a role in introducing these chemicals to the fjord sediments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{health effects}} of {{exposure}} to pollutants from electronic waste (e-waste) pose an important issue. In this study, we explored the association between oxidative stress and blood levels of e-waste-related pollutants. Blood samples were collected from individuals living in the proximity of an e-waste recycling site located in northern China, and pollutants, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), were measured in comparison to a reference population. The geometric mean concentrations of PCBs, <b>dechlorane</b> plus, and 2, 2 ′, 4, 4 ′, 5, 5 ′-hexabromobiphenyl in plasma from the exposure group were 60. 4, 9. 0, and 0. 55 ng g− 1 lipid, respectively, which were 2. 2, 3. 2, and 2. 2 {{times higher than the}} corresponding measurement in the reference group. Correspondingly, ROS levels in white blood cells, including in neutrophil granulocytes, from the exposure group were significantly higher than in those from the reference group, suggesting potential ROS related health effects for residents at the e-waste site.

40|$|<b>Dechlorane</b> Plus (DP) is a {{proposed}} {{alternative to the}} legacy flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209), {{a major component of}} Deca-BDE formulations. In contrast to BDE- 209, toxicity data for DP are scarce and often focused on mice. Validated dietary in vivo exposure of the marine bivalve (Mytilus galloprovincialis) to both flame retardants did not induce effects at the physiological level (algal clearance rate), but induced DNA damage, as determined by the comet assay, at all concentrations tested. Micronuclei formation was induced by both DP and BDE- 209 at the highest exposure concentrations (100 and 200 mu g/L, respectively, at 18 % above controls). DP caused effects similar to those by BDE- 209 but at lower exposure concentrations (5. 6, 56, and 100 mu g/L for DP and 56, 100, and 200 mu g/L for BDE- 209). Moreover, bioaccumulation of DP was shown to be concentration dependent, in contrast to BDE- 209. The results described suggest that DP poses a greater genotoxic potential than BDE- 20...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the emerging chlorinated ﬂame retardant <b>Dechlorane</b> Plus (DP) and three of its possible degradation products was investigated in white stork eggs from two colonies in Spain.

One possible degradation product, anti-[DP- 1 Cl], was found in approximately 10 % of the samples. No signiﬁcant stereoisomer enrichments were detected in any colony based on the average anti-DP fractional abundances found which agrees with previous studies in herring gulls.

Pike conger (Muraenesox talabonoides) had the highest concentrations of halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) among the six marine biota species. DDTs were the predominant HOPs, followed by PCBs and PBDEs, with minor contributions of DBDPE and DP. Twenty-one percent of samples had ratios of (DDE + DDD) /Sigma DDTs lower than 0. 5, implying the presence of fresh DDT inputs in {{the environment of the}} Xuande Atoll. The biomagnification factor values for DDTs, PCBs, PBDEs and DP were higher than 1, suggesting biomagnification of these contaminants in the marine food chains. Consumption of seafood from the Xuande Atoll might not subject local residents in the coastal areas of South China to health risks as far as HOPs are concerned. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{method for}} the simultaneous quantification of dechloranes, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) {{has been developed}} for gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry operating in electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) mode. The major advance has been achieved by combining selected ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes in well-defined time windows, to determine dechloranes, PBDEs and NBFRs at picogram per gram level in one single analysis in complex matrix biological samples. From the chromatographic point of view, efforts were devoted to study several injection modes using multimode inlet (MMI) {{in order to obtain}} low instrumental detection limits, necessary for trace compounds such as <b>Dechlorane</b> Plus (DP) isomers. Method performance was also evaluated: calibration curves were linear from 20 fg μL− 1 to 100 pg μL− 1 for the studied compounds, with method detection limits at levels of 50 fg g− 1 for DPs. Repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, were better than 5 % even in solvent vent mode for the injection of standards. The application {{to a wide range of}} complex samples (including food, human and animal serum samples) indicated a sensitive and reliable way to quantify at the picogram per gram level 4 halogenated norbornenes (HNs), <b>Dechlorane</b> Plus (anti-DP and syn-DP) and 2 of their homologues (Dechlorane- 602 and Dechlorane- 603), 11 PBDE congeners (no. 28, 47, 49, 66, 85, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209) and 5 novel BFRs, i. e. decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), hexabromobenzene (HBB), 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrabromo-ethylhexyl-benzoate (TBB) and tetrabromophthalate (TBPH).

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the {{development}} and validation of analytical methods for the de-tection and quantification of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in biological matrices, namely food and feed samples. POPs are a group of chemical compounds listed after the Stockholm Convention in 2001, with demonstrated toxicity and dangerousness for envi-ronment, animals and humans. In this work of thesis, special attention was reserved to some selected POPs: polychlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), usually referred to as “dioxins”, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as there is a}} big concern about these contaminants in Taranto, a city in the Southern Italy very close to Bari, my home town. Taranto, indeed, is characterized by a large industrial area with a steel mill, several incin-erators and a refinery in few kilometre radius (Di Leo et al., 2014). This work has been done in collaboration with the University of Liège (Belgium) where a consolidated exper-tise in the field of POP measurements was available, especially in terms of dioxin anal-yses. In Chapter 1 the main steps, from sample preparation to data elaboration, of a validated confirmatory method for dioxin and PCB detection in food and feed using gas chromatog-raphy coupled to tandem mass spectrometry Triple Quad instrument (GC-MS/MS Triple Quad) have been described. This method was developed at the University of Liège in the framework of the last updates of the EU Regulation that in 2014 allowed confirmatory quantitative analysis of dioxins with Triple Quad. This method was the starting point of this work of thesis, because it was used for all dioxin and PCB quantifications. In Chapter 2 and chapter 3 alternative clean-up approaches for dioxin analysis in fatty food matrices have been developed using different automated systems. These works have been done in the framework of solvent and time saving for high throughput analytical methods in dioxin analysis. In chapter 2, an already existing automated system, DEXTechTM from LCTech GmbH (LCTech GmbH, Bahnweg 41, 84405 Dorfen, Germany) was used for sample clean-up, but a completely new clean-up approach was developed with this. GC-MS/MS Triple Quad instrument, as well as Magnetic Sector High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) instrument were employed for final quantification, to demonstrate the suitability of our newly developed clean-up approaches whatever the instrumental detection. In Chapter 3 PowerPrepTM automated system from Fluid Management System (FMS Inc., 580 Pleasant Street, Watertown, MA 02472, USA) was used and our routine sample clean-up approach was modified in order to enhance the efficiency and to reduce cost and solvent consumption of the analysis. In Chapter 4 the main method for dioxin analysis was adapted for the integration of Dechloranes in the list of the analytes targeted in the regular control for dioxins in food and feed. Dechloranes are a family of 6 organo-chlorinated compounds with structure similar to Mirex, also called <b>Dechlorane,</b> a POP listed in the Stockholm convention. Dechloranes have been found in human blood of people from Europe (Brasseur et al., 2014) and in this work an analytical method for <b>Dechlorane</b> detection was developed and validated to investigate food as a possible route of exposure for humans in Europe, where no production plant has been identified so far. The analytical method was used to analyse 88 food and feed real sample and to give an idea of <b>Dechlorane</b> daily dietary intake...|$|E

Both syn-DP and anti-DP were detected in all samples. Another compound, Cl- 11 -DP, was detected in 45 % and 84 % of milk and serum samples, respectively. DP levels in blood and milk from residents living in the local environment > 20 yrs (R- 20 group) {{were significantly higher than}} those living in Taizhou < 3 yrs (R- 3 group) (p < 0. 05). The milk/serum partition coefficient from the same women was approximately 0. 43 and 0. 47 for syn-DP and anti-DP, respectively. A similar value in milk compared with anti-DP/Sigma DPs (f(anti)) in serum suggested that stereoselective DP bio-accumulation did not occur during the DP transport from blood to milk. This result indicate that DP can bio-accumulate in blood and milk with the low milk/serum partition coefficient and similar blood and milk stereoselective bio-accumulation profiles.

BDE's congener profile suggested the input of penta–bromodiphenylether (DE- 71) commercial formulation in the study area. Soil–air partitioning of PBDEs were investigated by employing octanol-air partition coefficients (KOA) and black carbon-air partition coefficients (KBC−A).

40|$|To address {{my first}} objective, I opportunistically {{collected}} road-killed bobcats (n= 44) throughout Illinois during 2013 - 2014, and analyzed their liver tissue {{for the presence}} of PCBs, PBDEs, and various other alternative halogenated flame retardants. Concentrations of ∑PCBs ranged from 76. 4 ng/g lw to 3782 ng/g lw (median 562. 97 ng/g lw). Male bobcats had significantly higher concentrations of PCBs than females (p = 0. 04). Concentrations of ∑PBDEs (including all detectable PBDE congeners) ranged from 8. 3 to 1920 ng/g lipid weight (median: 50. 3 ng/g lw). Among the alternative flame retardants screened, Dechloranes (including anti- and syn-Dechlorane Plus and Dechlorane- 602, 603, and 604), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were also detected frequently, with median concentrations of 28. 7, 5. 2, and 11. 8 ng/g lw, respectively. <b>Dechlorane</b> analogue compositions in bobcats were different from that reported in other studies, suggesting species- or analogue-dependent bioaccumulation, biomagnification, or metabolism of <b>Dechlorane</b> chemicals in different food webs. My findings, along with previously reported food web models, suggest Dechloranes may possess substantial bioaccumulation and biomagnification potencies in terrestrial mammalian food webs. Thus, attention should be given to these highly bioavailable flame retardants in future environmental biomonitoring and risk assessments in a post-PBDE era. 	To address my second objective I collected raccoons (n= 32) from various sites across Illinois and Missouri during 2013 - 2015. Liver tissues were analyzed {{for the presence of}} PBDEs and Dechloranes. ∑PBDE concentrations ranged from 19. 1 ng/g lw to 2124 ng/g lw (median = 98. 0 ng/g lw) and did not differ between gender or age of raccoon. Although nonsignificant (p= 0. 06), adult raccoons appeared to have greater PBDE concentration loads compared to juveniles. These nonsignificant differences are likely due to large variation in contaminant concentrations, possibly reflecting differences in individual raccoon diet and behavior. 	This is the first study reporting bioaccumulation of halogenated flame retardants in a wild felid in North America, and also the first report of PBDE accumulation in North American raccoons. The wide detection of Dechloranes, HBCD and TBCT in bobcats suggests a broad exposure of these alternative flame retardants in terrestrial apex predators in terrestrial ecosystems. The comparatively high levels of PBDEs in raccoons also suggest that biota in terrestrial habitats are still widely exposed to and susceptible to the bioaccumulation of these flame retardants...|$|E
