5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the <b>forward</b> <b>bulkhead</b> which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|However, most First Class {{rooms were}} left intact, {{save for the}} Salon Riviera and Salon Fontainebleau. The former was {{transformed}} into the Club International (dubbed Club-I by Norway aficionados), where every element of the original décor was removed. The square columns were made round with vertical aluminium fluting, the walls were repainted in a cream with baby-blue in the ceiling and wall niches, and all the original artwork and furniture was removed. In the corner niches oversized, crystal encrusted Neptune statues were placed, and similar crystal garlanded busts sat on brackets on the <b>forward</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> Lounge seating, sofas and rattan chairs were placed amongst potted ferns, giving the room an overall Miami art-deco feel. Only the railings and bronze, star-shaped light fixtures were original to the room. The latter space was gutted and remade into Checkers Cabaret; a small show lounge with abstract chrome palm trees around the columns, red lacquered wall panels, and a black-and-white checker board dance floor, again evoking a 1920s jazz club. The First Class Library remained untouched, and still used for the same purpose, while the Salon Debussy {{was turned into a}} shop, though its bronze décor and distinctive ceiling remained intact. To either side of these rooms ran the original First Class promenade decks, which were now turned into main circulation halls along the ship's principal public deck; the starboard dubbed Fifth Avenue and the port as Champs-Élysées, complete with columnar advertising posts similar to those found in Paris.|$|E
500|$|Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was {{protected}} with compound armor manufactured by the Dillinger Hütte works in Germany. The ship's armored belt was 305mm thick amidships, where it protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces, and reduced to [...] elsewhere.

5000|$|Most notably, she was torpedoed in the {{starboard}} bow by a German submarine, while in convoy in the Mediterranean during the First World War. Her passengers {{and most of}} the crew were transferred to a warship, but senior officers and some crew remained on board. To prevent one of her <b>forward</b> <b>bulkheads</b> from collapsing, she sailed backwards for over 60 miles at a speed of 3.5 knots, eventually arriving in Oran, where temporary repairs were made. Permanent repairs were then made in Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|The C1-B {{cargo ships}} were {{constructed}} with flush full scantling type decks having a raked stem and cruiser stern. Two complete steel decks, the main and second decks, were fitted {{and a third}} deck was fitted below the second deck extending from the stem to the <b>forward</b> machinery space <b>bulkhead.</b> The double bottom extended from the <b>forward</b> collision <b>bulkhead</b> to the after collision bulkhead. Two 28-foot lifeboats, with a capacity of 60 persons each, were stowed under mechanical davits on the bridge deck.|$|R
50|$|The Proud {{class was}} {{assigned}} to refurbished motor torpedo boat vessels originally manufactured by the British Power Boat Company during the Second World War. The Winola had been upgraded with gas turbine engines by the Marine Turbo Craft company, who had owned the craft before it was bought by Southern Television. In adapting the Southerner, <b>forward</b> <b>bulkheads</b> were removed to accommodate a 350 kg video recorder and other equipment, all {{of which could be}} installed and removed by crane for relatively easy turnaround. Two 4.5 inch image orthicon cameras were installed at the sides of the front deck while a third was mounted on top of the cabin for an all-round view. The cabin also housed the production control room.|$|R

500|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{displacement}} down and the speed the same as in the earlier armored cruisers, armor in the Tsukuba class was about the same in thickness, although in an improved layout. The waterline armor belt of Krupp cemented armor was [...] thick between the 12-inch gun turrets although it was only [...] thick fore and aft of the turrets. Above it was a strake of [...] armor that extended between the barbettes and protected the 6-inch casemates. The aft ends of the main armor belt were connected to the main gun barbettes by [...] transverse bulkheads. The lack of a <b>forward</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and the thinness of the aft bulkhead were serious weaknesses in the ships' protection.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1916, a fire was {{discovered}} in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts {{could be made to}} fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the explosion at the cost of their own lives. Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation {{and all of the other}} magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred in the vicinity of the torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the <b>forward</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.|$|R
2500|$|The second torpedo struck {{about three-quarters}} of the way along the ship, just outside the rear limit of the side armour plating. The torpedo punched through {{the side of the}} ship before {{exploding}} in the aft machine room. The explosion tore upward through two messes and a relaxation area called [...] "the Soda Fountain" [...] before finally ripping a 20-metre-long hole in the main deck. Later reports put the number of deaths in the area around the explosion at 275 men. After the explosion, the ship rapidly filled with smoke. The explosion also damaged [...] General Belgranos electrical power system, preventing her from putting out a radio distress call. Though the <b>forward</b> <b>bulkheads</b> held, water was rushing in through the hole created by the second torpedo and could not be pumped out because of the electrical power failure. In addition, although the ship should have been [...] "at action stations", she was sailing with the water-tight doors open.|$|R
500|$|On 4 October 1989, B-1B (s/n 85-0070) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, {{was forced to}} make an {{emergency}} landing at Edwards Air Force Base after suffering an in-flight failure of the No. 2 hydraulic system, which required use of the No 3 system to deploy the landing gear. After the nose gear failed to deploy, the crew attempted to lower the nose gear via the alternate emergency gear-extension method. [...] After several hours of attempting different means to lower the nose gear, {{the decision was made}} to perform a nose-gear-up landing on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards. The lower portion of the <b>forward</b> <b>bulkhead</b> used to mount the radar antenna was the only part of the aircraft to suffer damage, and after repairs, the jet was returned to Dyess in January 1990 by the same crew which performed the emergency landing.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{on other}} British battlecruisers, {{the bulk of}} the armour of the Courageous-class ships was made from high-tensile steel, a type of steel used {{structurally}} in other ships. Their waterline belt consisted of [...] covered by a [...] skin.

The belt had a height of , of which [...] was below the designed waterline. From the forward barbette a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear. After the loss of three battlecruisers to magazine explosions during the Battle of Jutland, [...] of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.|$|E
500|$|The Devastation-class ships had a {{complete}} wrought iron waterline armour belt that was 12 inches thick amidships and tapered to [...] outside the armoured citadel towards {{the ends of}} the ship.

The armoured citadel protected the bases of the gun turrets, the funnel uptakes and the crew's quarters. The sides of the citadel were 12 inches thick around the bases of the turrets and 10 inches thick elsewhere. The turrets were protected by two [...] plates, separated by a layer of teak with the turret face having the thicker armour. The magazine were protected by a 6-inch <b>forward</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and a [...] one aft. The conning tower ranged in thickness from 9 to 6 inches in thickness.
