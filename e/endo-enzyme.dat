40|$|P-N-Acetylglucosaminidase {{has been}} {{purified}} {{from the walls}} of Bacillus subtilis 168 and compared with the other known autolysin, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase (amidase). The /?-N-acetylglucosaminidase was a dimer in LiCl buffers with a sub-unit molecular weight of 90000 and a pH optimum of about 5. 0. It was very sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and was chically activated by 0. 1 to 0. 2 M-LiCl. It was insoluble in concentrations of LiCl lower than 0. 05 to 0. 1 M. It was less strongly bound to walls than was the amidase, which was a monomer of molecular weight 30000 to 40000 in LiCl buffers. The Q-N-acetylglucosaminidase is an <b>endo-enzyme</b> and showed no exo-activity. Lysozyme-like enzyme (muramidase) activity was undetectable in the wall extracts examined...|$|E
30|$|<b>Endo-enzyme</b> {{activities}} {{were determined by}} measuring the decrease in viscosity of a substrate solution, either 2 % (w/v) pectin for endo-PMG or 3.2 % (w/v) polygalacturonic acid (sodium salt) for endo-PG. Reduction in viscosity was determined according to a method of Mill and Tuttobello (1961), utilizing a graduated glass pipette as viscometer, which was modified as described in Heerd et al. (2014). The applied sample concentration was adjusted to 1 U/mL of exo-PG activity and the incubation time was reduced to 5  min at 40 °C. One unit of endo-pectinase activity (either PG or PMG) was defined according to Patil and Dayanand (2006) as the quantity of enzyme, which caused a 50 % reduction in viscosity of the reaction mixture per minute, under the applied assay conditions. Endo-pectinolytic {{activities were}} expressed as unit per milliliter crude extract (U/mL).|$|E
40|$|XGH (xylogalacturonan hydrolase; GH 28) is {{an enzyme}} that {{is capable of}} {{degrading}} XGA (xylogalacturonan), which is a polymer of ¿-D-galacturonic acid, highly substituted with ß-D-xylose. XGA is present in cell walls of various plants and exudates, such as gum tragacanth. XGA oligosaccharides were derived from an XGH digestion of gum tragacanth, then fractionated, and analysed for their sugar composition and structure by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS and nanospray MS. Several oligosaccharides from XGA were identified with different galacturonic acid/xylose ratios including five oligosaccharide isomers. Although XGH can act as an <b>endo-enzyme,</b> product-progression profiling showed that the disaccharide GalAXyl was predominantly produced from XGA by XGH, which indicated also an exolytic action. The latter was further supported by degradation studies of purified oligosaccharide GalA 4 Xyl 3. It was shown that XGH acted from the non-reducing end towards the reducing end of this oligosaccharide, and showed the processive character of XGH. The results from this study further show that although XGH prefers to act between two xylosidated GalA units, it tolerates unsubstituted GalA units in its - 1 and + 1 subsites...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} research was started through {{the observation that}} the rate of gelatin decomposition by Bacillus subtilis, meas-ured by formol titration, continued to increase for at least 5 days after the cells had reached their maximal number. This behavior which differs fundamentally from that of sugar fermentations was finally {{explained by the fact that}} decomposition of gelatin is brought about by an extracellular enzyme while sugar fermenta-tions are due to <b>endo-enzymes.</b> The rate of any fermentation is proportional to the number of enzyme molecules. In fermentations brought about by <b>endo-enzymes,</b> such as lactic, alcoholic and colon fermentations, the enzyme concentration is proportional to the number of cells, for it seems reasonable to assume that the average enzyme content per cell is fairly constant. Thus, when the maximal number of cells has been reached, the enzyme concentration can increase no more, and the maximal rate of fermentation is reached at this point. One of the authors (Rahn, 1910) has worded this some-what differently: "The point of inflection (of the curve of products plotted against time) indicates the moment when the maximum number of bacteria is present. " Accumulation of products may retard the rate even before the maximal number of cells has been reached, as e. g., in the lactic fermentation, figure 1. This rule does not apply to extracellular enzymes. They are comparable to secreted metabolic products of the cell. They are produced either as long as the cell lives, or until old age retards all metabolism, or until the enzyme concentration of the mediu...|$|R
40|$|Four enzymes were {{separated}} from an extracellular preparation of Bacillus polymyxa by carboxymethylcellulose column chromatography. The pH optima were 8. 3 to 8. 5, 8. 7 to 8. 9, 9. 2 to 9. 4, and 9. 5 to 9. 6. All of the enzymes required calcium ion for maximum activity, whereas strontium ion was only partially effective in stimulating activity. Cobalt {{was the only}} other cation tested which was effective in two of the enzymes. The lyases seem to attack a calcium salt-bridged substrate. Km and Vm data of the four enzymes on various oligomers are presented as well as paper chromatographic evidence of preferred sites of attack.

40|$|The pectic enzymes in Pectolyase were {{separated}} by ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Three pectin lyases, two polygalacturonases, and a pectinmethylesterase were resolved. The enzymes were further purified on Mono Q and/or Mono S columns to remove traces of cellulase. The enzymes had molecular weights ranging from 25, 000 to 36, 000 daltons. They were optimally active between pH 4. 0 and 6. 2 and were not greatly affected by ions. The pectin lyases and polygalacturonases were <b>endo-enzymes.</b> They solubilized uronic acids from washed cell wall fragments, but the lyases were much {{more effective than the}} polygalacturonases. The mixture of enzymes constituting Pectolyase increased ethylene production 15 - to 25 -fold when introduced into tomato and orange fruits. The enzymes purified from Pectolyase all increased ethylene production in the fruits but the lyases were generally more effective than the hydrolases...|$|R
30|$|Exo-PMG {{activity}} {{obtained by}} cultivation of A. sojae ATCC 20235 was higher compared to A. sojae CBS 100928. In comparison to results of previous work (Heerd et al. 2012), PMG {{activity in the}} extract of A. sojae ATCC 20235 slightly decreased by 10 %, while the PMG activity in the extract of A. sojae CBS 100928 increased by 25 % after optimizing SSF conditions. These changes are irreducible {{in contrast to the}} change of exo-PG activity, which is confirming that primarily the exo-pectinase activity degrading polygalacturonic acid was increased by this optimization. Furthermore, the obtained extracts of both strains were diluted to 1 U/mL of exo-PG activity to compare the ratio of exo-PG activity and endo-pectinolytic activities. The values given in Table  7 show an almost balanced ratio of exo- to endo-PG activity for both strains with a slightly higher endo-PG activity. The ratio of exo-PG activity to endo-PMG activity is also balanced in the extract of A. sojae CBS 100928. The endo-PMG activity in the extract of A. sojae ATCC 20235 is slightly lower than the exo-PG activity. The SSF process optimization for enhanced exo-PG production increased also the <b>endo-enzyme</b> activities of both strains in comparison to previous results (Heerd et al. 2012). Comparing endo-PG with endo-PMG activities, higher activity of polygalacturonic acid degrading enzymes was produced in the extracts of both strains.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{digestion}} {{of dietary}} starch in humans is initiated by salivary a-amylase, an <b>endo-enzyme</b> that hydrolyzes starch into maltose, maltotriose and larger oligosaccharides. Salivary amylase accounts for 40 to 50 % of protein in human saliva and rapidly alters the physical properties of starch. Importantly, {{the quantity and}} enzymatic activity of salivary amylase show significant individual variation. However, linking variation in salivary amylase levels with the oral perception of starch has proven difficult. Furthermore, the relationship between copy number variations (CNVs) in the AMY 1 gene, which influence salivary amylase levels, and starch viscosity perception has not been explored. Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that saliva containing high levels of amylase has sufficient activity to rapidly hydrolyze a viscous starch solution in vitro. Furthermore, we show with time-intensity ratings, which track the digestion of starch during oral manipulation, that individuals with high amylase levels report faster and more significant decreases in perceived starch viscosity than people with low salivary amylase levels. Finally, we demonstrate that AMY 1 CNVs predict an individual’s amount and activity of salivary amylase and thereby, ultimately determine their perceived rate of oral starch viscosity thinning. Conclusions: By linking genetic variation and its consequent salivary enzymatic differences to the perceptual sequellae of these variations, we show that AMY 1 copy number relates to salivary amylase concentration and enzymatic activity level...|$|E
40|$|Cell walls {{prepared}} {{from the}} endosperm tissue of hydrated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds undergo autohydrolysis. Release of carbohydrates is most rapid (0. 4 - 0. 6 [mu]g per endosperm) within the 1 st h of incubation in buffer, but substantial autolysis is sustained {{for at least}} 10 h. Autolysis is temperature sensitive, and the optimum rate occurs at pH 5. The rate of autolysis increases markedly in the period just prior to radicle emergence. The cell-wall polysaccharide composition in micropylar and lateral endosperm regions differs significantly; the micropylar walls are rich in arabinose and glucose with substantially lower amounts of mannose. Although walls prepared from both micropylar and lateral regions undergo autolysis, micropylar walls release carbohydrates {{at a higher rate}} than lateral walls. Autolysis products elute as large polymers when subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting that <b>endo-enzyme</b> activity is responsible for release of fragments containing arabinose, galactose, mannose, and uronic acids. Arabinose, galactose, mannose, and glucose are also released as monomers. As a function of time, the ratio of polymers to monomers decreases, indicating that exo-enzyme activity is also present. Thermoinhibition or treatment with abscisic acid suppresses germination and reduces the rates of autolysis of walls isolated from the endosperm by about 25 %. Treatments that alleviate thermoinhibition (kinetin and gibberellic acid) increase the rates of autolysis by 20 to 30 % when compared to thermoinhibited controls...|$|E
40|$|Human chitotriosidase (HCHT) is {{involved}} in immune response to chitin-containing pathogens in humans. The enzyme is able to degrade chitooligosaccharides as well as crystalline chitin. The catalytic domain of HCHT {{is connected to the}} carbohydrate binding module (CBM) through a flexible hinge region. In humans, two active isoforms of HCHT are found-the full length enzyme and its truncated version lacking CBM and the hinge region. The active site architecture of HCHT is reminiscent to that of the reducing-end exo-acting processive chitinase ChiA from bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmChiA). However, the presence of flexible hinge region and occurrence of two active isoforms are reminiscent to that of non-processive endo-chitinase from S. marcescens, SmChiC. Although the studies on soluble chitin derivatives suggest the endo-character of HCHT, the mode of action of the enzyme on crystalline chitin is not known. Here, we made a thorough characterization of HCHT in terms of the mode of action, processivity, binding, and rate constants for the catalysis and dissociation using α-chitin as substrate. HCHT efficiently released the end-label from reducing-end labelled chitin and had also high probability (95 %) of endo-mode initiation of processive run. These results qualify HCHT as an endo-processive enzyme. Processivity and the rate constant of dissociation of HCHT were found to be in-between those, characteristic to processive exo-enzymes, like SmChiA and randomly acting non-processive <b>endo-enzymes,</b> like SmChiC. Apart from increasing the affinity for chitin, CBM had no major effect on kinetic properties of HCHT...|$|R
40|$|Alpha-amylases are {{widespread}} <b>endo-enzymes</b> {{involved in}} the hydrolysis of internal alpha-(1, 4) glycosidic linkages of starch polymers. Molecular modeling of amylose-amylase interactions is a step toward enzymatic mechanism understanding and rational design of new enzymes. From the crystallographic complex of barley alpha-amylase AMY 2 -acarbose, the static aspects of amylose-amylase docking have been characterized with a model of maltododecaose (DP 12) (G. André, A. Buléon, R. Haser, and V. Tran, Biopolymers 1999, Vol. 50, pp. 751 - 762; G. André and V. Tran, Special Publication no. 246 1999, The Royal Society of Chemistry, H. J. Gilbert, G. J. Davies, B. Henrissat, and B. Svensson, Eds., Cambridge, pp. 165 - 174). These studies, consistent with the experimental subsite mapping (K. Bak-Jensen, G. André, V. Tran, and B. Svensson, Journal of Biological Chemistry, to be published), propose a propagation scheme for an amylose chain in the active cleft of AMY 2. The topographical overview of alpha-amylases identified loop 7 as a conserved segment flanking the active site. Since some crystallographic experiments suspected its high flexibility, its putative motion was explored through a robotic scheme, an alternate route to dynamics simulations that consume CPU time. The present article describes {{the characteristics of the}} flexibility of loop 7 : location and motion in AMY 2. A back-and-forth motion with a large amplitude of more than 0. 6 nm was evaluated. This movement could be triggered by two hinge residues. It results in the loop flipping over the active site to enhance the docking of the native helical substrate through specific interactions, it positions the catalytic residues, it distorts the substrate towards its transition state geometry, and finally monitors the release of the products after hydrolysis. The residues {{involved in the}} process are now rational mutation points in the hands of molecular biologists...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{work on the}} {{structure}} of the cell walls of red kidney bean hypocotyls and mesocarp from unripe and ripe mango fruits showed significant differences. Cell-wall fractions from each were obtained using solvent extraction (water, alkali and acid) and enzymic (endopolygalacturonase) degradation procedures. The monosaccharide composition of each fraction was determined after TFA-hydrolysis by TLC-analysis. Greatest variation in monosaccharide compositions was observed in the water-soluble fractions which accounted for 18 %, 48 % and 11 % of the cell walls of the bean, unripe and ripe mango, respectively. Water-soluble carbohydrates present in the mango pulp were examined by TLC, gel-filtration and ion-exchange methods. Only sucrose, fructose, glucose and high-MW polysaccharides were detected. The ripe mango contained 8 times more soluble polysaccharide than the unripe. In the ripe fruit the approximate MW of the polysaccharide fraction, which was rich in uronic acid was 40, 000. In the unripe fruitpolysaccharides with MW's ranging from 40, 000 to > 300, 000 were detected. These polymers contained much smaller proportions of uronic acid than those from the ripe mesocarp. A crude 3 M LiCl enzyme extract from the cell walls of the ripe mango was able to solubilize 14 % of prepared cell walls from the unripe fruit. The mechanism of this process was investigated. <b>Endo-enzymes</b> involved could not be identified. The involvement of b-galactosidase in cell-wall degradation was examined. Using p-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside as substrate, 3 wall-bound forms of the enzyme were found in the ripe fruit and 2 in the unripe. Four soluble forms which were different from the wall-bound forms were observed in the ripe fruit. Three of these were present in the unripe fruit. The action of the enzyme forms on mango pectin and cell walls was examined. There was no evidence that any were directly implicated in cell-wall degradation.

Using purified pig gastric mucus glycoprotein (PGM) as the substrate, oligosaccharides liberated from PGM were pyridylaminated, and the reducing terminal sugars of oligosaccharides larger than Gal beta 1 - 3 GalNAc were analysed by h. p. 1. c. The crude enzyme of endo-GalNAc-ase-S was prepared as an 80 % (w/v) ammonium sulphate precipitate from the concentrated culture medium. The enzyme was partially purified by gel chromatofocusing and subsequent DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography. <b>Endo-enzyme</b> activity eluted around pI 4. 8 on a gel chromatofocusing column and eluted with 0. 19 - 0. 25 M-NaCl on a DEAE-Toyopearl column. In the enzyme fraction obtained, no exo-glycosidases or proteases could be detected. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 105 kDa by gel filtration, and the optimum pH was 5. 5. Endo-GalNAc-ase-S hydrolysed the O-glycosidic linkage between GalNAc and Ser (Thr) in 3 H-labelled and unlabelled asialofetuin, liberating both the disaccharide (Gal beta 1 - 3 GalNAc) and the tetrasaccharide [Gal beta 1 - 3 (Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc beta 1 - 6) GalNAc].

40|$|Abstract Background The {{interaction}} of plants with endophytic symbiotic fungi in the genus Trichoderma alters the plant proteome and transcriptome {{and results in}} enhanced plant growth and resistance to diseases. In a previous study, we identified the numerous chitinolytic enzyme families and individual enzymes in maize which are implicated in plant disease resistance and other plant responses. Results We examined the differential expression of the entire suite of chitinolytic enzymes in maize plants in the presence and absence of T. harzianum. Expression of these enzymes revealed a band of chitinolytic enzyme activity that had greater mass than any known chitinase. This study reports the characterization of this large protein. It {{was found to be}} a heretofore undiscovered heterodimer between an exo- and an <b>endo-enzyme,</b> and the endo portion differed between plants colonized with T. harzianum and those grown in its absence and between shoots and roots. The heterodimeric enzymes from shoots in the presence and absence of T. harzianum were purified and characterized. The dimeric enzyme from Trichoderma -inoculated plants had higher specific activity and greater ability to inhibit fungal growth than those from control plants. The activity of specific chitinolytic enzymes was higher in plants grown from Trichoderma treated seeds than in control plants. Conclusions This is the first report of a dimer between endo- and exochitinase. The endochitinase component of the dimer changed post Trichoderma inoculation. The dimer originating from Trichoderma inoculated plants had a higher antifungal activity than the comparable enzyme from control plants. </p...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies from}} this {{laboratory}} have identified rat epididymal luminal fluid acid beta-D-galactosidase activity which also optimally hydrolyses a glycoprotein substrate at neutral pH [Skudlarek, Tulsiani and Orgebin-Crist (1992) Biochem. J. 286, 907 - 914]. We have now separated the luminal fluid beta-D-galactosidase into two molecular forms by ion-exchange chromatography on {{a column of}} DE- 52. The separated enzyme activities were purified to an apparent homogeneity by molecular-sieve chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized p-nitrophenyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The purified forms, when resolved by SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions, showed apparent molecular masses of 84 and 97 kDa. Kinetic studies, including a pH-dependent substrate preference and pH-dependent association/dissociation, disclosed no differences between these two forms. The two forms had identical N-terminal amino acid sequences. However, the 97 kDa form contained much more total carbohydrate and sialic acid than the 84 kDa form. The carbohydrate moieties in the two forms were assessed by comparing their size on SDS/PAGE before and after treatment with <b>endo-enzymes.</b> The removal of N-linked glycans by treatment with N-glycanase or endoglycosidase F generated de-N-glycosylated polypeptides of an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, and indicated that the two forms contained varying amounts of asparagine (N) -linked high mannose/hybrid-type and biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides. This result {{and the fact that}} the two molecular forms had identical N-terminal amino acid sequences indicated that the two forms probably have identical or very similar polypeptides. The potential role of the enzyme in modification of sperm plasma membrane (PM) glycoproteins was examined by resolving caput sperm PM proteins (before and after treatment in vitro of the membranes with the purified beta-D-galactosidase) on SDS/PAGE, followed by staining with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a lectin which preferentially binds to Gal beta 1, 3 GalNAc-linkages found in O-linked glycoproteins. The evidence presented in this report has indicated that a PNA-positive glycoprotein of an apparent molecular mass of 135 - 150 kDa present on the caput (but not cauda) sperm PM is degalactosylated by the digestion in vitro of the membranes with purified luminal fluid beta-D-galactosidase.
