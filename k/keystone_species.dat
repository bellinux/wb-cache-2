5|$|A <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> is {{a species}} that is {{connected}} to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. <b>Keystone</b> <b>species</b> have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> model can be applied.|$|E

Within the savannas of the {{southern}} Kalahari, land use practices can change habitat structure profoundly, so that rangelands either became densely wooden through bush thickening or are cleared completely using arboricides or manual tree felling and bush clearance, or are at some stage in between. Demands for the wood of camelthorn trees (Acacia reioloba), (the largest tree species growing on semi-arid and arid Kalahari sands) for firewood has also impacted habitat structure. Large trees are important in the Kalahari ecosystem because they provide shade, nesting and foraging sites for birds and mammals, as well as microhabitats that facilitate {{the existence of a}} suite of subcanopy plants.

The black oystercatcher is a species of high conservation concern throughout its range (U.S., Canadian, Alaskan, and Northern & Southern Pacific Shorebird Conservation Plans), a <b>keystone</b> indicator <b>species</b> along the north Pacific shoreline, a management indicator species in the Chugach National Forest, and a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service focal species for priority conservation action.|$|R
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are <b>keystone</b> <b>species,</b> which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a <b>keystone</b> <b>species,</b> controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E

30|$|Whitebark pine is a <b>keystone</b> subalpine <b>species,</b> {{which is}} rapidly declining {{due to the}} {{introduced}} disease, {{white pine blister rust}} (Cronartium ribicola A. Dietr.) (McDonald and Hoff 2001), combined with mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) epidemics exacerbated by climate change and associated drought. Fire suppression and subsequent increase in successional replacement of whitebark pine are believed to have contributed to this decline (Keane et al. 1994). Due to this decline, whitebark pine is currently listed as an endangered species in Canada (GOC 2015) and as a candidate for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act in the United States (USFWS 2015).|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a <b>keystone</b> <b>species.</b> Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a <b>keystone</b> <b>species,</b> as it is assumed, through {{controlling}} the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|This spotted cat {{most closely}} resembles the leopard physically, {{although}} it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer {{to those of the}} tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator {{at the top of the}} food chain (an apex predator). It is a <b>keystone</b> <b>species,</b> playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered <b>keystone</b> <b>species.</b> Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E

Carbon {{and nitrogen}} cycling are inextricably linked, {{so what are}} the consequences of increased reactive nitrogen deposition for the sustainability and functioning of peatlands, and does the form of the nitrogen deposition make a difference? We have addressed these questions for an ombrotrophic peatland, Whim bog in SE Scotland, using a globally unique field simulation of reactive N deposition as dry deposited ammonia and wet deposited reduced N, ammonium and oxidised N, nitrate, added as ammonium chloride or sodium nitrate. The effects of 10 yr of reactive N additions, 56 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, depended on the N form. Ammonia-N deposition caused the <b>keystone</b> Sphagnum <b>species,</b> together with the main shrub Calluna and the pleurocarpous mosses to disappear, exposing up to 30 % of the peat surface. This led to a significant increase in soil water nitrate and nitrous oxide emissions. By contrast wet deposited N, despite significantly reducing the cover of Sphagnum and Pleurozium moss, did not have a detrimental effect on Calluna cover nor did it significantly change soil water N concentrations or nitrous oxide emissions. Importantly 10 yr of wet deposited N did not bare the peat surface nor significantly disrupt the vegetation, enabling the N to be retained within the carbon rich peatland ecosystems. However, given the significant role of Sphagnum in maintaining conditions that retard decomposition this study suggests that all nitrogen forms will eventually compromise carbon sequestration by peatlands through loss of some <b>keystone</b> Sphagnum <b>species...</b>|$|R

There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the prairie dog also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, striped skunk and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the prairie dog does this. In conclusion, the prairie dog is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining <b>keystone</b> <b>species</b> of the ecoregion.|$|E
