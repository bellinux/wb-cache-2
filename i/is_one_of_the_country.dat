To support the policy making process DG Agriculture and Rural Development has launched a large study, “Support for Farmers’ Cooperatives (SFC) ”, that will provide insights on successful cooperatives and producer organisations {{as well as on}} effective support measures for these organisations. These insights can be used by farmers themselves, in setting up and strengthening their collective organisation, and by the European Commission in its effort to encourage the creation of agricultural producer organisations in the EU. Within the framework of the SFC project this country report on the evolution of agricultural cooperatives in Sweden has been written. Data collection for this report has been done in the summer of 2011. In addition to this report, the project has delivered 26 other country reports, 8 sector reports, 33 case studies, 6 EU synthesis reports, a report on cluster analysis, a study on the development of agricultural cooperatives in other OECD countries, and a final report.

Our country Rwanda needs to develop the rural electrification sectors in order to provide illumination to the population living in those rural  areas for rapid development in different sectors like schools; health centers; business centers; administrative officers. As MSE we have this opportunity to show our contribution by making a feasibility study of Gisuma Micro-hydropower plant in Gisagara District. A micro hydropower is used in the rural electrification and does not necessary supply electricity to the national grid. Micro hydro powers plants are utilized in isolated and off-grid like Gisuma areas. In Rwanda the existing electricity network necessity high transmission lines and low load factor and this has an implication of high cost of extending to grid extension. The future Gisuma micro hydropower plant will be managed by the local population people of Gisuma sector and we hope to have a rapid change and development of daily life  from Gisuma people. To get all required information one of method to be used is the interview of peoples which are living in that region and site visits by measurement of important data such as head, discharge, topographic data of the river are presented. Then, the results obtained were analyzed using RETScreen software to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the plant to identify electromechanical equipments such as turbine, alternator, etc [...] , to be used in that micro-hydropower...|$|E
