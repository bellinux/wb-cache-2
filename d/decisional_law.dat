2500|$|In {{addition}} to jury sentencing through {{the guidance of}} aggravating factors, a constitutional capital sentencing scheme must provide for appellate review of the death sentence, typically by the state's supreme court.

40|$|This article {{draws upon}} the civic republican {{tradition}} to offer new conceptual {{resources for the}} normative assessment of mental capacity law. The republican conception of liberty as non-domination is used to identify ways in which such laws generate arbitrary power that can underpin relationships of servility and insecurity. It also shows how non-domination provides a basis for critiquing legal tests of decision-making that rely upon ‘diagnostic’ rather than ‘functional’ criteria. In response, two main civic republican strategies are recommended for securing freedom {{in the context of}} the legal regulation of psychological disability: self-authorisation techniques and participatory shaping of power. The result is a series of proposals for the reform of <b>decisional</b> capacity <b>law,</b> including a transition towards purely functional assessment of decisional capacity, surer legal footing for advanced care planning, and greater control over the design and administration of decision-making capacity laws by those with psychological disabilities...|$|R

On that date Governor Frank Morrison approved Legislative Bill No. 49 of the 73 rd Session of the Nebraska Legislature enacting the Uniform Commercial Code. In one sweep of the pen, Nebraska had law (or would, in September 1965, have law) in areas where none has existed previously—either in statutory or <b>decisional</b> form, <b>law</b> which it had taken even the most important commercial states and the British common law jurisdictions hundreds of years to develop. The panorama of the Code is the coverage of a commercial transaction involving any kind of personal property from beginning to end. It is divided into ten articles.

40|$|The {{landmark}} Supreme Court {{decision in}} In re Gault established, among other things, a juvenile 2 ̆ 7 s right to counsel in delinquency prosecutions. However, the decision left unanswered certain questions {{relating to the}} nature and scope of that right. In this article, the author examines whether or not Gault initiated a special due process right to counsel for juveniles apart from that body of sixth amendment law previously developed in criminal cases. Alternatively, he wonders whether Gault was meant to initiate a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the juvenile justice system. The author critically analyzes the resulting trends of <b>decisional</b> and statutory <b>law</b> in various jurisdictions. The particular focus {{on the right to}} counsel at pre-trial identification procedures provides a most useful paradigm for examining incorporation in the juvenile context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} work is to {{conclude}} a short confirmation for business ethics. A redundant argument for business ethics, should, in our opinion start from the philosophical field. A major problem with business ethics is the foreclosing of philosophy, society and politics from its debate area. Before understanding the common sense for business ethics, {{we have to know}} how to act in a moral way. It is important to understand the identity of the human being, its signification and goals. Therefore the first part of this research enclose to philosophy, pointing out three aspects concerted to morality. We consider that only after a proper analyze of the human being, we can argue for business ethics and its implication in different area. Otherwise “business” becomes a problem for “ethics” and “ethics” become a problem for “business”. morality, business ethics, <b>decisional</b> process, moral <b>law,</b> personal ethics, microethics, macroethics...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} regularly outs {{information concerning}} people 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality, gender identity, and HIV status. Notwithstanding {{the implications of}} such outings, the Supreme Court has yet to resolve whether the Constitution contains a right to informational privacy - a right to limit the government 2 ̆ 7 s ability to collect and disseminate personal information. This Article probes informational privacy theory and jurisprudence {{to better understand the}} judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to fully embrace a constitutional right to informational privacy. The Article argues that while existing scholarly theories of informational privacy encourage us to broadly imagine the right and its possibilities, often focusing on informational privacy 2 ̆ 7 s ability to promote individual dignity and autonomy, there is a disconnect when courts attempt to translate those theories into workable doctrine. The extant theories are products of Fourth Amendment and <b>decisional</b> privacy <b>law,</b> and bear a more attenuated relationship to informational privacy problems, hindering recognition of the right. This Article reorients and hones the focus of the purported informational privacy right toward what the Due Process Clause suggests as the right 2 ̆ 7 s two principal and more concrete values: preventing intimate information from serving as the basis for potential discrimination and creating space for the formation of political thought. By so doing, not only is a more precise theory of informational privacy constructed, but instrumentally (and perhaps most importantly), courts will be more apt to recognize a constitutional informational privacy right thereby better insulating individuals from discrimination or marginalization...|$|R

50|$|Civil law, {{civilian}} law, or Roman {{law is a}} {{legal system}} originating in Europe, intellectualized {{within the framework of}} late Roman law, and whose most prevalent feature is that its core principles are codified into a referable system which serves as the primary source of law. This can be contrasted with common law systems whose intellectual framework comes from judge-made <b>decisional</b> <b>law</b> which gives precedential authority to prior court decisions on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions (doctrine of judicial precedent, or stare decisis).|$|E

40|$|The {{ideas of}} H. Kelsen have {{acquired}} a considerable popularity, their influence {{can also be}} seen in Polish jurisprudence of the post-war era. The article touches on some selected problems, which upon an analysis, can reveal the interrelation of concepts of the Polish authors with the theory of law of H. Kelsen. In my opinion the <b>decisional</b> model of <b>law</b> application is a transcription of the Kelsenian ascribing within a politically lawful provisions and the third stage of the model is a close reflection of ascribing within theoretically lawful provisions. The Kelsenian concept of conjugate norms is universally applied in the works of Polish lawyers. Other propositions of the author are essential for the problem of validity of law. The Kelsenian construction of a ground-norm as the eventual principle of a system is of a permanent value in the analysis of a relative validity of law. The divisions of legal principles into complete and incomplete ones is not approved in the Polish legal literature. The possibility of assimilation of some elements of the Kelsenian theory of law is effected by multilaterality of the theory of law based on the methodological and philosophical principles of Marxism. The examples quoted in the article can confirm the value of some Kelsenian theoretical solutions for the multilateral research in jurisprudence.

50|$|While the Layton {{years on}} the Supreme Court were often {{difficult}} and controversial for the bar, the period was one of outstanding growth for Delaware corporate law.

5000|$|The {{other major}} {{implication}} of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of state law {{when there is no}} federal issue (and thus no federal supremacy issue) in a case.

5000|$|Horses {{may still}} be {{expected}} to use the roadways, as well bicycles and automobiles. The former are a regular appearance in both urban areas and in the country, and are commonly exercised by commuters and Amish. Many roads are unchanged since the 1800s while controlled-access highways have been invented specifically for the automobile. Ships now have marine radar that allows one to view tens of miles beyond the eye. [...] "At common law a motorist is required to regulate his speed {{so that he can}} stop within the range of his vision. In numerous jurisdictions, this rule has been incorporated in statutes which typically require that no person shall drive any motor vehicle in and upon any public road or highway at a greater speed than will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead."

50|$|Expanding {{the scope}} of the {{intermediate}} enhanced scrutiny standard of judicial review previously announce in Unocal and Moran v. Household International, Inc., the Revlon opinion gave rise to years of academic debate and <b>decisional</b> <b>law</b> with respect to the events that should be deemed to trigger its application. Even today, questions continue to persist as {{to the extent to which}} the doctrine has been absorbed into the traditional duty of care, particularly in connection with so-called ownership transactions such as mergers, and its interplay with the Unocal test traditionally applicable to defensive board action to fend off a hostile acquisition bid, and more recently to deal protection devices contained in merger agreements. See Omnicare v. NCS Healthcare, Inc. 818 A.2d 914 (Del. 2003); compare, e.g., In re Netsmart Technologies, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, 924 A.2d 171 (Del. Ch. 2007). Despite the expanse of precedent that Revlon has engendered in the more than 20 years since its issuance, the Revlon doctrine remains alive, well and surprisingly vague in terms of its scope and its application. Far more certain, however, is the likelihood that as a result of the principles enunciated by the Revlon decision, practitioners can be assured that cash mergers and change of control transactions will engender far closer judicial scrutiny than the broad judicial deference that had been previously regarded as typical and appropriate, as will a board's approval of provisions in merger agreements that unduly restrict the board's ability to entertain more lucrative offers that appear between signing of the merger agreement and its presentation for approval of shareholders. Even actions by independent boards in such circumstances that fail to evidence a reasonable effort and intent to secure the highest and best price reasonably available are likely to invoke searching judicial scrutiny. However, recent Delaware litigation deferred to an independent's board decisions to not engage in negotiations with a competing bidder to try to obtain improved terms after a merger agreement had been signed.|$|E
5000|$|It is true {{that the}} trial court found that the {{configuration}} of Day-Brite's fixture identified Day-Brite to the trade because the arrangement of the ribbing had, like a trademark, acquired a [...] "secondary meaning" [...] by which that particular design was associated with Day-Brite. But if the design is not entitled to a design patent or other federal statutory protection, then it can be copied at will.As we have said in Sears, while the federal patent laws prevent a State from prohibiting the copying and selling of unpatented articles, they do not {{stand in the way of}} state law, statutory or decisional, which requires those who make and sell copies to take precautions to identify their products as their own.

And, of course, a State cannot hold a copier accountable in damages for failure to label or otherwise to identify his goods unless his failure is in violation of valid state statutory or <b>decisional</b> <b>law</b> requiring the copier to label or take other precautions to prevent confusion of customers as to the source of the goods.|$|E
