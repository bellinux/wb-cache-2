40|$|This study investigates {{differences}} in <b>financial</b> <b>funding</b> between immigrant and non-immigrant businesses and delineates factors influencing <b>financial</b> <b>funding</b> of immigrant businesses. Data {{for the study}} were collected in Israel between 2000 and 2005. By combining convenient and snowball samples, 214 native Israelis and 153 FSU immigrant entrepreneurs answered a questionnaire. We classified financial sources for immigrant businesses according to their affiliation to the ethnic community, and according to their relation to official financial institutions. Our study revealed that the scope of funding of immigrant businesses is significantly smaller than that of non-immigrant businesses. Immigrant entrepreneurs {{are more likely to}} finance their businesses from informal sources but they use fewer loans from family and friends than non-immigrant entrepreneurs. We found that immigrant entrepreneurs who deal with co-ethnic clients do not use more ethnic sources of capital for financing their businesses: the share of co-ethnic clients does not influence the ratio of ethnic financial sources for both setting up and expanding immigrant businesses. Our study revealed that governmental support in the terms of designated loans is the most salient factor influencing <b>financial</b> <b>funding</b> of immigrant businesses.

Spent fuel normally {{is disposed}} without reprocessing, though there are instances of spent fuel sent to Russia for reprocessing. For the spent fuel that is not reprocessed, it is kept at the nuclear reactor site for five years in pools and then sent to dry storage. Additionally, in 2005 the residents of Bataapati, {{in the south of}} the country, approved construction plans for low and intermediate-level waste storage facility.
