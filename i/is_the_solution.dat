25|$|Artúr mac Áedáin was {{the eldest}} son of Áedán mac Gabráin. He never became king of Dál Riata; his brother Eochaid Buide ruled after their father's death. However, Artúr became war leader when Áedán gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though Áedán was officially still king. Thus it was Artúr who led the Scoti of Dál Riata in a war against the Picts, {{separate}} from the later war with Northumbria. Under this hypothesis, Artúr was predominantly active in the region between the Roman walls, the Kingdom of the Gododdin. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> proposed by David F. Carroll (in his book Arturius: A Quest for Camelot, 1996) and by Michael Wood.|$|E
25|$|Other {{branches}} of physics also received attention {{during the period}} of the Scientific revolution. William Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth I, published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Robert Boyle (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the Royal Society of England (1660) and the Academy of Sciences in France (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as John Wallis, William Brouncker, Thomas Sydenham, John Mayow, and Christopher Wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, James Bernoulli showed that the cycloid <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, Johann Bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to the brachistochrone problem.|$|E
25|$|For the Renaissance {{architect}} {{designing the}} west {{front of a}} large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since Alberti's additions to Santa Maria Novella in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-Grâce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter's Basilica. At St Peter's, Carlo Maderno had solved this problem by constructing a narthex and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter's were not built above the parapet.|$|E

500|$|This is {{not universally}} agreed upon. [...] Anton Bierl argues that Sappho's offer to pray to Hera is contrasted with a {{masculine}} ideology {{in which the}} pursuit of wealth <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to the family's problems, {{and therefore suggests a}} male relative of Sappho as the addressee of the poem. [...] Lardinois sees the argument that Sappho's mother could have gone to pray to Hera for her son's safe return herself, and therefore it does not make sense for her to send Sappho to do so on her behalf, as the strongest against the thesis that the addressee is Sappho's mother, arguing on this basis for a male addressee. [...] In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word [...] to describe their speech: meaning [...] "chattering" [...] or [...] "babbling", the word has negative connotations which would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man. [...] Anja Bettenworth has argued that the addressee is of a lower social status than Sappho, again based on the use of , but Kurke argues that the addressee is likely {{to be in a position}} of authority over Sappho, as Sappho expects them to send her to pray to Hera.|$|E
500|$|The third {{reference}} to the Styx is in Christopher Morley's The Trojan Horse. A return to the romantic comedy of Chaucer <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> that Boitani sees {{to the problem of}} how the love story can survive Shakespeare's handling of it. Morley gives us such a treatment in a book that revels in its anachronism. Young Lieutenant (soon to be Captain) Troilus lives his life in 1185 BC where he has carefully timetabled everything from praying, to fighting, to examining his own mistakes. He falls for Cressida after seeing her, as ever, in the Temple of Athena where she wears black, as if mourning the defection of her father, the economist Dr Calchas. The flow of the plot follows the traditional story, but the ending is changed once again. Troilus' discovery of Cressida's change of heart happens just before Troy falls. (Morley uses Boccaccio's version of the story of a brooch, or in this case a pin, attached to a piece of Diomedes' armour as the evidence that convinces the Trojan.) Troilus kills Diomedes as he exits the Trojan Horse, stabbing him in the throat where the captured piece of armour should have been. Then Achilles kills Troilus. The book ends with an epilogue. The Trojan and Greek officers exercise together by the River Styx, all enmities forgotten. A new arrival (Cressida) sees Troilus and Diomedes and wonders why they seem familiar to her. What Boitani calls [...] "a rather dull, if pleasant, ataraxic eternity" [...] replaces Chaucer's Christian version of the afterlife.|$|E
