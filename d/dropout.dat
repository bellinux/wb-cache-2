40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} <b>dropouts</b> from type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D) care in communal primary health care. Design: An observational study. Setting: In a Finnish city, {{patients with}} T 2 D {{who had not}} contacted the public primary health care system during the past 12 months were identified with a computer based search and contacted by a trained diabetes nurse. Subjects: <b>Dropouts</b> from T 2 D treatment. Main outcome measures: Demographic factors, laboratory parameters, examinations, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Of the patients with T 2 D, 10 % (n= 356) were <b>dropouts</b> and 60 % of them were men. Median HbA(1 c) was 6. 5 (QR for 25 % and 75 %: 6. 0, 7. 7) %, (45 [42, 61] mmol/mol).

50|$|High school <b>dropouts</b> {{are less}} likely to be active labor force {{participants}} and are more likely to be unemployed than their more educated counterparts. The current unemployment rate for high school <b>dropouts</b> is about 56 percent greater than that for high school completers. Lifetime earnings for this group are estimated to be $260,000 less than those for high school graduates.

High school <b>dropouts</b> make up 68 percent of the nation’s prison population. Nearly 37% of <b>dropouts</b> live in poor/near poor families.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum <b>dropout</b> age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum <b>dropout</b> age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum <b>dropout</b> age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Dropouts</b> in IVF-programmes affect {{cumulative}} pregnancy rates (CPRs), but it {{is unknown}} what the impact of loss to follow-up is. METHODS: Data were obtained from 588 couples starting IVF treatment ('as treated group'). Cycle-based and real-time-based CPRs were calculated using three assumptions for dropouts: <b>dropouts</b> having no probability of pregnancy, <b>dropouts</b> having the same probability of pregnancy as those continuing treatment and <b>dropouts</b> stopping because of medical reasons having no chance of pregnancy and those stopping because of other reasons having the same probability of pregnancy as those continuing treatment. CPRs obtained in the 'as treated group' were compared with CPRs calculated using the data set including the follow-up data of the <b>dropouts</b> ('completed group'). RESULTS: In 1. 7 % of couples, no follow-up could be obtained. The cycle-based CPR after three IVF-cycles ranged from 63 % to 71 % in the 'as treated group' and was 65 % in the 'completed group'. The real-time-based CPR after 9 months ranged from 54 % to 59 % in the 'as treated group' and was 55 % in the 'completed group'. The PR in <b>dropouts</b> was 14 % (95 % confidence interval 8. 22 %). CONCLUSIONS: In IVF programmes, outcome data of <b>dropouts</b> remain unknown, and CPRs should be calculated by assuming <b>dropouts</b> to have a PR between no probability and the same probability as those who continue treatment.

We proposed that <b>dropouts</b> with a vocational qualification should be more likely to enter a stable employment (Hypothesis 2 a) and achieve on average a higher occupational status than <b>dropouts</b> without a vocational qualification (Hypothesis 2 b). Again, the overall probability of entering a stable job is higher for <b>dropouts</b> with pre-tertiary vocational training.
