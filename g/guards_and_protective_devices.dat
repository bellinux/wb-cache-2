40|$|One of {{the primary}} emphases in {{planning}} and designing distribution networks is the reliability evaluation considering {{the economic impact of}} minimizing the interruptions for the end users in the networks. An effective way to minimize the customer interruptions is to use <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (fuses <b>and</b> CBs) and sectionalizing switches. In power distribution reliability analysis, the optimal placement of switches <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> can reduce the annual failure rate and outage duration of the customers and consequently improves the reliability indices of the networks. This research presents a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming model aiming to identify the type, optimum number <b>and</b> location of <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> <b>and</b> sectionalizing switches in distribution networks more accurately. A value-based reliability optimization formulation is derived from the proposed model. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed formulation both technical and economic constraints are considered. In power distribution reliability analysis, distributed generation (DG units) can potentially improve network reliability by reducing interruption duration and restoration time after a given fault. However, such improvement depends on the operation mode of the DG units. An island can be formed when sufficient local generation exists to avoid load prioritization and/or shedding. The problem of optimum switch <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> placement becomes more complicated when DG units are present in distribution networks. A method for solving the problem of optimal placement of sectionalizing switches with high penetration of DG is also presented in this research. The primary objective is to minimize the total cost of achieving a certain level of reliability in presence of DG. The problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming to determine the optimal number and location of sectionalizing switches. The accuracy of the reliability analysis can be affected directly by the customer interruption cost model. A probability distribution cost model (PDM) is developed based on a cascade correlation neural network to have a more accurate reliability assessment. The performances of the proposed approaches are assessed and illustrated by studying on the RBTS test system and a typical real size network. Simulation results verify the capability and accuracy of the proposed approaches...|$|R

At this moment, IEEE 1547 standard states that DG clearing time should be based on the during-fault voltage range. However, DG units will be required to be still connected to the grid during fault period in the future due to high penetration level. This will influence the behavior of network protection schemes.

40|$|When tensioned, {{ordinary}} materials expand {{along the}} direction of the applied force. Here, we explore network concepts to design metamaterials exhibiting negative compressibility transitions, during which a material undergoes contraction when tensioned (or expansion when pressured). Continuous contraction of a material in the same direction of an applied tension, and in response to this tension, is inherently unstable. The conceptually similar effect we demonstrate can be achieved, however, through destabilisations of (meta) stable equilibria of the constituents. These destabilisations give rise to a stress-induced solid-solid phase transition associated with a twisted hysteresis curve for the stress-strain relationship. The strain-driven counterpart of negative compressibility transitions is a force amplification phenomenon, where an increase in deformation induces a discontinuous increase in response force. We suggest that the proposed materials could be useful for the design of actuators, force amplifiers, micro-mechanical controls, <b>and</b> <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b> Comment: Supplementary information available at [URL]...|$|R
