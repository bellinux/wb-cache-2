They {{play a vital}} role in diverse biological processes such as aging and apoptosis. In humans, defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) are responsible for or associated with a bewildering variety of diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple animal and a powerful genetic and developmental model system. In this review, we discuss how the nematode model system has contributed to our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, of the genetics and inheritance of the mitochondrial genome, and of the consequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Mitochondrial respiration is vital to energy metabolism but also to other aspects of multicellular life such as aging and development.

Since then this area has been flourished further and many interesting results appeared for noncommuting mappings.|$|R

This review argues that, in hematology, zebrafish have demonstrated their suitability, are proving their utility, have supplied timely and novel discoveries, and are poised for <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions.</b> It presents {{an overview of the}} anatomy, physiology, and genetics of zebrafish hematopoiesis underpinning their use in hematology research. Whereas reverse genetic techniques enable functional studies of particular genes of interest, forward genetics remains zebrafish's particular strength. Mutants with diverse and interesting hematopoietic defects are emerging from multiple genetic screens. Some mutants model hereditary blood diseases, occasionally leading to disease genes first; others provide insights into developmental hematology. Models of malignant hematologic disorders provide tools for drug-target and pharmaceutics discovery. Numerous transgenic zebrafish with fluorescently marked blood cells enable live-cell imaging of inflammatory responses and host-pathogen interactions previously inaccessible to direct observation in vivo, revealing unexpected aspects of leukocyte behavior. Zebrafish disease models almost uniquely provide a basis for efficient whole animal chemical library screens for new therapeutics.

40|$|In vivo nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique {{that can be used}} to investigate the metabolic response of plant tissues to anoxia. It has been used extensively in studies aimed at assessing the contribution of particular pathways to energy production and pH control during oxygen deprivation; and it is also a powerful method for investigating the origin and metabolic significance of the intracellular pH changes that occur in anoxic tissues. Recent N MR investigations of plant anaerobiosis are reviewed and it is concluded: (a) that the NMR approach provides a detailed description of the time-dependent interaction between some of the key pathways of carbon and nitrogen metabolism under anoxia; and (b) that it can provide strong evidence for the direct effect of pH on metabolism, and for the biochemical pH-stat model of the anoxic response. The significance of the NMR contribution to the understanding of plant anaerobiosis is discussed, and the possibility that the well characterized role of pH in anaerobic metabolism could mask a more fundamental role for Ca 2 + is considered. Finally, the future prospects lot NMR in this field are outlined and it is concluded that the continuing development of the technique itself, coupled with the increasing availability of transgenic plants, will extend the opportunities for testing metabolic hypotheses in vivo, and should therefore guarantee <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to the understanding of plant anaerobiosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} programme of research was to identify an effective strategy for promoting regular physical activity among university students who have low involvement with this issue. According to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM),issue-involvement is "the {{extent to which the}} attitudinal issue under consideration is of personal importance" (Petty & Cacioppo, 1979, p. 1915). In previous research there have been significant but inconsistent results for the interaction between message framing and issue involvement. Therefore, the current research programme explores the effectiveness of message framing as a strategy that can increase university students' attitudes and intentions towards regular physical activity in the first three studies, while the fourth study investigates an alternative strategy of message formation focusing on certainty of outcomes. The first three studies investigated the interactions between message framing (positive/negative), issue involvement (high/low), and argument quality (strong/weak) by integrating the postulates of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982) and those of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM, Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The design of the fourth study was informed by the results from the first three studies and the recently identified 'perceived certainty of outcomes' factor as a key determinant of message framing effects. Overall, the results were not consistent with the previous findings from message framing studies (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) as the framing variable had no significant effects. However, in the first three studies, issue involvement had statistically significant effects on attitudes and intentions to engage in regular physical activity. In addition, there were 2 two-way interactions between framing and issue-involvement for averaged attitudes and the likelihood of engaging in regular physical activity. In the fourth study, there were small but positive correlations between perceived certainty of outcomes and need for cognition scores and one of three intention items. The perceived uncertainty of outcomes correlated significantly with intentions and averaged attitudes. Even though these correlations were significant, the magnitude of these values were relatively small (r = 0. 4). In conclusion, the results of the first three studies of this research programme added evidence to the emerging trend to discard the framing of health promotion messages as aligned with the function of associated behaviours (i. e. prevention vs. detection). In addition to the evidence supporting these new claims about message framing, the current research programme has <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to the health promotion knowledge base. Studies one and three are the first studies to investigate the integration of message framing and the ELM constructs of issueinvolvement and argument quality to identify a strategy to increase regular physical activity among university students. Although, the results for message framing were not significant, high issue-involvement was observed to be an important variable for changing attitudes and intentions towards regular physical activity. Therefore, increasing involvement with regular physical activity can be identified as a significant strategy that can contribute to the health promotion of regular physical activity among university students...|$|E

To extract features from the clothing, the clothing region first must be localized or segmented in the image. At the same time, given multiple images of the same person wearing the same clothing, we expect to improve the effectiveness of clothing segmentation. Therefore, the identity recognition and clothing segmentation problems are inter-twined; a good solution for one aides in the solution for the other. We build on this idea by analyzing the mutual information between pixel locations near the face and the identity of the person to learn a global clothing mask. We segment the clothing region in each image using graph cuts based on a clothing model learned from one or multiple images believed to be the same person wearing the same clothing. We use facial features and clothing features to recognize individuals in other images. The results show that clothing segmentation provides a significant improvement in recognition accuracy for large image collections, and useful clothing masks are simultaneously produced. A <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> is that we introduce a publicly available consumer image collection where each individual is identified. We hope this dataset allows the vision community to more easily compare results for tasks related to recognizing people in consumer image collections. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Moral {{philosophers}} {{have given}} increased attention to moral intuitionism in recent years. Despite articulations of moral intuitionism {{that should be}} taken more seriously than they have been, dissenters continue to express opposition. Among the most frequent criticisms of moral intuitionism are the Mysteriousness and Dogmatism Objections. The Mysteriousness Objection charges moral intuitionists with postulating a mysterious faculty of knowing. The Dogmatism Objection accuses moral intuitionists of relying on dogmatic assertions which are not, or cannot be, proven or adequately argued for. In this dissertation I defend moral intuitionism against both attacks. By drawing on resources going back to eighteenth-century intuitionists, I show that a carefully articulated moral intuitionism neither requires a mysterious faculty of knowing nor invites dogmatism. I first investigate the moral intuitionism of four eighteenth-century British philosophers (Samuel Clarke, John Balguy, Richard Price, and Thomas Reid) which anticipates and begins to address the Mysteriousness and Dogmatism Objections. Both critics of and adherents to moral intuitionism in the contemporary period have largely ignored the moral intuitionism of these eighteenth-century thinkers. Two <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> of this chapter are that it gives serious attention to the moral intuitionism of the eighteenth-century moral intuitionists, and it prepares for utilizing their views in answering objections to contemporary moral intuitionism. Next, I briefly explicate a plausible version of a moderate moral intuitionism against which the Mysteriousness and Dogmatism Objections are evaluated. Finally, I set {{out the details of}} each of these objections and respond to them. The sustained attention I give to these objections is a <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> of this dissertation. I conclude that the Mysteriousness and Dogmatism Objections are not successful attacks on moral intuitionism. ...|$|R

In this study we investigated the role of commonly accepted factors for Foxp 3 induction, TCR stimulation and cytokines such as IL- 2, TGFb and IL- 10, in the generation of human CD 4 + CD 25 + Foxp 3 + T cells by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

This minimal reaction was characterized in detail and {{was shown to}} be stimulated by CMP, cytidine and cytosine. By using several cytidine and cytosine analogs evidence is provided that this enhancement is rather caused by base pairing to rRNA, followed by a structural change, than by a base mediated general acid/base catalysis.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a more robust {{framework}} for understanding the management processes involved in Corporate Brand Communications. A {{review of the literature}} on corporate branding shows a growing body of conceptual work, but also highlights that much of the recent work in the field has not focused on the underlying processes involved in managing a corporate brand. There is, therefore, a clear need to understand how a corporate brand is defined, developed and communicated. This international study adopts a Participatory Action Research approach, grounded in Intervention Theory (Argyris, 1973), {{to develop a}}n intervention framework based on the concept of privileged access' (Torbet, 1991). This methodological framework is tested on a pilot study and then adopted for the study of three separate organisations in the UK, France and the Netherlands to answer three distinct, but related Research Questions. Based upon the findings emerging from these studies, the researcher identifies a series of `emergent management stages', and uses this empirical evidence to develop a new `Six Conventions' framework for understanding the processes of nurturing and managing a corporate brand. The study makes an explicit contribution to the field by helping to `join up' many of the existing, disparate conceptual models. It makes a <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> by grounding the `Six Conventions' framework in rich empirical data in a way that operationalizes the inherent management processes in a new and more robust manner than previous studies. These findings offer both new insight to academics, and a set of guiding principles and practices for managers engaged in managing brands at an organisational level, fulfilling the requirements of Participatory Action Research to generate both Propositional and Practical knowledge. A further methodological contribution is provided by demonstration of the potential that participatory approaches, utilising the concept of this privileged access', offer in contrast to traditional case research.

40|$|The {{educational}} underachievement of Gypsy/Traveller {{children was}} first {{identified in the}} late 1960 s. Yet subsequent government reports and other sources from the mid- 1980 s through to the 2000 s continue to emphasise the significant educational ‘underachievement’ of children from these communities. This thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge by considering why nothing much seems to have changed for these children for over fifty years. It does this by exploring the distinctive relationship between these children’s particular lifeways and the educational structure of schooling in England. The theoretical aim of this work is to consider the lived experience {{within the context of}} spatial theory. By deploying a spatial ‘lens’ to analyse the schooling situation faced by Gypsy/Traveller communities, this thesis makes a <b>further</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> to knowledge. Space and place are being reconceptualised, particularly within the social sciences, in order to help make sense of the power relations implicit within contemporary capitalist society. However, educational enquiry has only recently begun to embrace this ‘spatial turn’ and this thesis therefore offers an original empirical insight into this developing field of investigation. The work finds that some teachers and some schools are able to adapt dominant cultural practices in order to accommodate Gypsy/Traveller children. However, many schools find this difficult to achieve due to tension between the cultural norms and expectations associated with the dominant cultural norm of Sedentarism and those of Nomadism, which continues to be a strong cultural characteristic of many Gypsy/Traveller communities. A further finding highlights how community encouragement for the adoption of strict gender roles at a young age is also {{at the heart of the}} ‘problem’ of educational underachievement, as some parents restrict access to schooling beyond primary education. Despite this, it was found that, for some girls, schooling proved to provide a space in which to challenge the gender norms of their communities. There is limited literature relating to issues of gender and the schooling of Gypsy/Traveller children, and this work offers an empirical insight into this developing field of enquiry...|$|R

The crushing of composite structures provides significant dissipation of energy in a crash if a brittle buckling mode is prevented from occurring. Triggers are needed {{to ensure that the}} failure initiation involves splitting and folding of the laminate and that the failure develops into a stable crushing mode. The research reported in this thesis focuses on practical triggers that can be incorporated into the subfloor structure of helicopter airframes. The work was part of a collaborative research project including the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). A small-scale specimen, namely the DLR crush element, was tested with a variety of triggers. Finite Element models were developed to predict the failure of these structures using the explicit solver PAM-CRASH. The test program included quasi-static testing carried at UNSW and at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in Australia, and dynamic testing at the DLR laboratories in Stuttgart. Finally a large scale test article was manufactured by the CRC-ACS and the thesis details finite element prediction of the quasi-static and dynamic tests in Stuttgart and comparison against experimental test data. This research included the application of a stacked-shell finite element modelling methodology for predicting the initial triggering and progressive crushing of laminates. This analysis methodology was validated against experimental test data. The study included chamfer, steeple and ply-drop triggers and makes recommendations as to the most appropriate form of trigger for inclusion in structures that are expected to carry static loads but trigger when dynamically loaded.

The development of a versatile hypervalent I(III) reagent-mediated α-chlorination of α, β-unsaturated carbonyls, and dihalogination of simple alkenes, is presented in Chapter Two of this thesis. An enantioselective variant of the dihalogenation reaction was also explored with a chiral hypervalent iodine reagent. Another under-developed area is the oxidative cyclisation of electron rich aromatics to generate complex polycycles. The development of an oxidative cyclisation employing non-traditional nucleophiles, in particular electron rich vinylogous esters is detailed in Chapter Three of this thesis. The related catalytic reaction cascade utilising an electron rich ketone, together with a second nucleophile on the vinylogous ester is presented in Chapter Five of this thesis. Finally, although catalytic enantioselective utilisation of hypervalent I(III) reagents has been achieved, there is much room, and great need for <b>further</b> development. <b>Significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to this area were achieved by developing catalytic variants of our oxidative cyclisation of electron rich vinylogous ester and its related reaction cascade. In addition, a new chiral aryl iodide was synthesised and utilised in the oxidative cyclisation reaction, and is detailed in Chapter Four. Although the chiral aryl iodide promoted the reaction, no significant enantioselectivity was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{bending stiffness}} EI of the ulna {{was measured in}} vivo by mechanical resistance tissue analysis (MRTA) in 90 men aged 19 - 89 years. MRTA measures the impedance response of low-frequency vibrations to determine EI, which {{is a reflection of}} elastic modulus E and moment of inertia I for the whole ulna. EI was compared to conventional estimates of bone mineral content (BMC), bone width (BW), and BMC/BW, which were all measured by single-photon absorptiometry. Results obtained from the nondominant ulna indicate that BW increases (r = 0. 27, p = 0. 01) and ulnar BMC/BW decreases (r = - 0. 31, p < or = 0. 005) with age. Neither BMC nor EI declined with age. The single best predictor of EI was BW (r 2 = 0. 47, p = 0. 0001), and <b>further</b> small but <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> were made by BMC (r 2 = 0. 53, p = 0. 0001) and grip strength (r 2 = 0. 55, p = 0. 0001). These results suggest that the resistance of older men to forearm fracture is related to age-associated changes in the moment of inertia achieved by redistributing bone mineral farther from the bending axis. We conclude that the in vivo assessment of bone geometry offers important insights to the comprehensive evaluation of bone strength...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{variety of}} N-terminal co-translational {{modifications}} play crucial roles in many cellular processes across eukaryotic organisms. Recently, N-terminal acetylation {{has been proposed}} as a regulatory mechanism for the control of plant immunity. Analysis of an N-terminal acetyltransferase complex A (NatA) mutant, naa 15 - 1, revealed that NatA controls the stability of immune receptor Suppressor of NPR 1, Constitutive 1 (SNC 1) in an antagonistic fashion with NatB. Here, we further report on an antagonistic regulation of flowering time by NatA and NatB, where naa 15 - 1 plants exhibit late flowering, opposite of the early flowering phenotype previously observed in natB mutants. In addition, we provide evidence for the involvement of another N-terminal modification, N-myristoylation, in controlling pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) through the characterization of N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT 1) defective mutants, which express {{a low level of}} NMT 1 protein. The mutant line lacks induced production of reactive oxygen species and MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to treatment with the known immune elicitor flg 22. NMT 1 deficient plants also exhibit increased susceptibility to Pst hrcC, a non-pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae tomato strain lacking a functional type-III secretion system. The potential for the NatA-NatB antagonistic relationship to exist outside of the regulation of SNC 1 as well as the disclosing of NMT 1 s role in PTI <b>further</b> supports the <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> of N-terminal co-translational modifications in the regulation of biological processes in plants, and present interesting areas for further exploration...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{cells have}} been {{reported}} {{to play an important role}} in the uptake of organic contaminants. This study was undertaken to provide an insight into the role of the root cell walls and their subfractions on sorption of phenanthrene to roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Root cell walls were isolated and further sequentially fractioned by removing pectin, hemicellulose one, and hemicellulose two. They were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid-state (13) C NMR. Root cell walls had a greater proportion of aromatic carbon and exhibited a lower polarity than the bulk roots. There was a stepwise increase in aromatic carbon content and a decrease in polarity following the sequential fractionation. The sorption affinity of phenanthrene increased gradually following the sequential extraction of root cells. A significant positive correlation between the sorption affinity K(OC) values and the aromatic carbon contents (r(2) = 0. 896, p < 0. 01) and a negative correlation between the sorption affinity K(OC) values and polarity ((O + N) /C) of root cell fractions (r(2) = 0. 920, p < 0. 01) were obtained. Improved modeling was achieved for phenanthrene sorption by involving the contribution of root cell walls as a source of root carbohydrates instead of using root lipids alone, which <b>further</b> confirms the <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> of root cell walls to phenanthrene sorption on wheat roots. The results provide evidence for the importance of the root cell walls in the partitioning of phenanthrene by plant roots...|$|R
