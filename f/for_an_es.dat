40|$|Abstract. Explicit Substitutions (ES) calculi are {{extensions}} of the λ-calculus that internalize the substitution operation, which is a meta-operation, by taking it as an ordinary operation belonging to the gram-mar of the ES calculus. As a formal system, ES are closer to imple-mentations of functional languages and proof assistants, and are useful for studying properties of such systems. Nevertheless, several ES calculi do not satisfy important properties related with the simulation of the λ-calculus, such as confluence on open terms, simulation of one step β-reduction, full composition and the preservation of strong normalization (PSN). The latter, which states that λ-terms without infinite reduction sequences can only be finitely reduced in the ES calculus, is easily lost in such extensions. In a recent work, D. Kesner developed the λex-calculus, {{which is the first}} ES calculus that satisfies all the good properties ex-pected <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> calculus. In this work we present a formalization of the λex-calculus in the Coq Proof Assistant, which is fully available a...|$|E
40|$|Applications in fault {{diagnosis}} are continuously being implemented to serve different sectors. Car failure detection is {{a sequence of}} diagnostic processes that necessitates the deployment of expertise. The Expert System (ES) {{is one of the}} leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that have been adopted to handle such task. This paper presents the imperatives <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> in developing car failure detection model and the requirements of constructing successful Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) for such model. In addition, it exhibits the adaptation of the ES in the development of Car Failure and Malfunction Diagnosis Assistance System (CFMDAS). However, CFMDAS development faces many challenges such as collecting the required data for building the knowledge base and performing the inferencing. Furthermore, diagnosis of car faults requires high technical skills and experienced mechanics who are typically scarce and expensive to get. Thus, systems such as CFMDAS can be highly useful in assisting mechanics for failure detection and training purposes. Moreover, capturing and retaining valuable knowledge on such domain yield more accurate and less time consuming models...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of expert systems (ES) for manufacturing problems indicates {{a need to}} interact with potentially large amounts of data, much of which resides elsewhere in the ES user's organization. A large amount of information required for planning, design, and control operations can be made available through an existing database management system (DBMS). The need <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> to access that data is critical. This paper presents two approaches to the {{development of}} ES-DBMS interfaces, both query-language based. One approach uses a procedural attachment to the ES language to obtain the required data via the DBMS query language, while the other one uses a separate interface program between the ES and the query language of the DBMS. The procedural attachment is able to acquire data from a DBMS at a faster rate than the interface program, however, the procedural attachment lacks knowledge of the DBMS schema. On the other hand, the interface program sacrifices speed but promotes flexibility, as it has the capability of selecting which DBMS to extract the required data from and allowing augmentation of schema knowledge outside of the ES. A disadvantage of the interface approach is the amount of time involved in data retrieval. The process of writing information to disk files is I/O intensive. This can be quite slow, particularly in PROLOG, the language used to implement the ES. Thus the use of such an interface is only suitable in applications such as design, where extremely fast I/O is not require...|$|E
40|$|Five {{workshops}} on verification and validation (V&V) of expert systems (ES) where taught during this recent period of performance. Two key activities, previously performed under this contract, supported these recent workshops (1) Survey of state-of-the-practice of V&V of ES and (2) Development of workshop material and first class. The first activity involved performing an extensive survey of ES developers {{in order to}} answer several questions regarding the state-of-the-practice in V&V of ES. These questions related to the amount and type of V&V done and the successfulness of this V&V. The next key activity involved developing an intensive hands-on workshop in V&V of ES. This activity involved surveying {{a large number of}} V&V techniques, conventional as well as ES specific ones. In addition to explaining the techniques, we showed how each technique could be applied on a sample problem. References were included in the workshop material, and cross referenced to techniques, so that students would know where to go to find additional information about each technique. In addition to teaching specific techniques, we included an extensive amount of material on V&V concepts and how to develop a V&V plan <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> project. We felt this material was necessary so that developers would be prepared to develop an orderly and structured approach to V&V. That is, they would have a process that supported the use of the specific techniques. Finally, to provide hands-on experience, we developed a set of case study exercises. These exercises were to provide an opportunity for the students to apply all the material (concepts, techniques, and planning material) to a realistic problem...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{function of a}} Low Probability ofIntercept (LPI) radar is to prevent its interception by <b>an</b> Electronic Support (<b>ES)</b> receiver. This objective is generally achieved {{through the use of}} a radar waveform that is mismatched to those waveforms <b>for</b> which <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> receiver is tuned. This allows the radar to achieve a processing gain, with respect to the ES receiver, that is equal to the time-bandwidth product ofthe radar waveform. This processing gain allows the LPI radar to overcome the range-squared advantage ofthe ES receiver in conventional situations. Consequently, <b>a</b> conventional <b>ES</b> receiver can only detect an LPI radar at very short ranges (< 3 nm). The focus of this thesis was to develop <b>an</b> <b>ES</b> receiver to detect LPI radar signals with the same sensitivity as conventional pulse signals. It implements a detector which employs a technique, known as "deramping," that forms an adaptive matched filter to the linear FMCW LPI radar signal in order to achieve the processing gain that is equal to the received signal's time-bandwidth product. An experimental transmitter was built to emulate the radar signal with FMCW characteristics and transmitted through a standard gain horn. The transmitted signal is then received via a receiver horn, mixed down to an intermediate frequency (IF), sampled by an A/D convenor and digitally deramped using a Pentium II computer. It was demonstrated that the LPI radar signal can be extracted from the noise background by means of digital derampingMaj, Republic of Singapore NavyMaj, Republic of Singapore Air Forc...|$|R

Here we present a method to construct nonparametric confidence intervals for single-case ESs {{in the context of}} various single-case designs. For this method we use the relationship between a two-sided statistical hypothesis test at significance level α and a 100 (1 – α) % two-sided confidence interval. This relationship implies that <b>a</b> confidence interval <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>ES</b> measure θ contains all point null hypothesis θ values that cannot be rejected by the hypothesis test at the significance level α (Neyman, 1937). Consequently, a method of hypothesis test inversion (HTI) can be derived that uses repeated randomization tests (RTs) to construct a nonparametric confidence interval for θ. We will refer to this procedure as randomization test inversion (RTI).
