5|$|At {{the time}} of the fall of Nojpetén, there are {{estimated}} to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> also played their part.|$|E
5|$|Several nomadic <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> in Maritime Southeast Asia live in {{boats and}} derive nearly {{all they need}} from the sea. The Moken people live on the coasts of Thailand and Burma and islands in the Andaman Sea. The Bajau people are {{originally}} from the Sulu Archipelago, Mindanao, and northern Borneo.

The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history; the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; and the Oka Crisis of 1990, {{the first of a}} number of violent confrontations between the government and <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups.</b> Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups.</b> Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Muisca, as the <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> in {{the west}} of Colombia, {{developed}} a variety of textiles from fique or cotton. Cords were made of fique or human hair. The people of the cold climate Altiplano {{did not have a}} major cotton production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the Muzo {{in the west}}, Panche in the southwest, Guane in the northwest, and the Guayupe in the east. From the raw cotton, the Muisca women made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E
5|$|The area's history {{begins with}} several <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups,</b> {{including}} the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia {{as the first}} permanent New World English colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each {{played a significant role}} in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.|$|E
50|$|On October 2008, the Lumads (an <b>indigenous</b> <b>group)</b> {{organized}} {{a conference in}} Naga, Zamboanga Sibugay involving several <b>indigenous</b> people <b>groups.</b> In this summit, the <b>indigenous</b> people <b>groups</b> questioned the utility of IPRA in protecting their rights described in the IPRA. In this summit, the <b>indigenous</b> people <b>groups</b> discussed the instances the Philippine Law hindered their rights promised by IPRA. Primarily, the inconsistencies lie in how the Philippine Law prohibited them from following their customs and traditions that is centered around the indigenous people's governance of their land.|$|R

5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends. The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> and his personal relationships with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups,</b> who often {{practice}} traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> {{closer to}} the Caribbean Coast, the people traded highly {{valuable}} sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails were worth more than {{the price of gold}} to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the Andes. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca formed the basis for the legend of El Dorado that became widespread among the Spanish conquistadors; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.|$|E

5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified belief system shared among the various <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups,</b> there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E
5|$|By the mid-16th century, the Spanish {{frontier}} expanding outwards from Comitán and Ocosingo {{reached the}} Lacandon Forest, and further advancement was impeded by the region's fiercely independent inhabitants. At {{the time of}} Spanish contact in the 16th century, the Lacandon Forest was inhabited by Ch'ol people referred to as Lakam Tun. This name was Hispanicised to Lacandon. The Lakandon were aggressive, and their numbers were swelled by refugees from neighbouring <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> fleeing Spanish domination. The ecclesiastical authorities were so worried by this threat to their peaceful efforts at evangelisation that they eventually supported military intervention. The first Spanish expedition against the Lakandon {{was carried out in}} 1559; repeated expeditions into the Lacandon Forest succeeded in destroying some villages but did not manage to subdue the inhabitants of the region, nor bring it within the Spanish Empire. This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{executed}} {{a number of}} nuclear tests {{on the island of}} Amchitka in the face of vehement opposition from environmental and local <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups.</b> The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage to the surrounding area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, the AEC executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, the AEC announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. After a United States Supreme Court challenge to the testing failed by one vote, the testing proceeded as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E

5|$|Early {{settlers}} did not {{adhere to}} traditional architectural practices when constructing houses, but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses {{are no longer}} standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with thatched roofs, resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century. Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and other foreign and <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> lived {{according to their own}} cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation. As racial segregation eased {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the public display of Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. In the period {{immediately}} before and during European colonization, there were four distinct <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> in the area. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name {{from members of the}} Spanish Portola expedition. Because {{it was one of the}} only reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river's flood threat, major channelization and damming projects were undertaken in the 20th century, resulting in the loss of much of the natural river channel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century the small {{population}} of Ch'ol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, {{where the people}} were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century. Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed {{and most of the}} mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén, compared to ten times that number in 1697. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between <b>indigenous</b> <b>groups</b> also played their part.|$|E

40|$|Bartering is {{a native}} {{practice}} that, while generally confined to remote periods, in recent decades {{has taken on a}} renewed significance in different contexts. In this paper, we present a case study where barter is practiced as part of the social memory of the Kokonuco people, an <b>indigenous</b> <b>group</b> in the department of Cauca, and among whom its meaning transcends the purely economic realm, something already suggested by the sociologists Marcel Mauss and Max Weber. We argue that the return to barter by this <b>indigenous</b> <b>group</b> is related to globalizing factors, established in treaties such as the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and the need to strengthen their struggle for self-determination and food autonomy as well as instill indigenous values among new generations. The paper concludes with some questions that offer future challenges to this <b>indigenous</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R
