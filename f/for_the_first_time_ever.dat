Epsilon was the fifth name of the list, and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms.

5|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Bristol Rovers was Albert Prince-Cox, who introduced blue-and-white quarters as the team's kit {{because he believed}} it made the players look larger and more intimidating. He also became the first manager {{to win a major}} cup competition with the club when they won the Division 3 (South) Cup in 1935. More success followed in the 1952–53 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title {{for the first time since}} 1905 and won promotion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> when the club won Division 3 (South). Tann remained in charge for eighteen years from 1950 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|Also the Norwegian plug-in {{electric}} vehicle {{market share of}} new car sales is {{the highest in the}} world.

In 2014, the all-electric market share climbed to 13.8% accounting for plug-in hybrids. The combined sales of new plug-in cars reached a market share of 23.4% in 2015. A record market share of 29.1% was achieved in 2016. The highest ever monthly market share for the plug-in electric passenger segment was achieved in January 2017 with 37.5% of new car sales. Also in January 2017 the electrified passenger car segment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> surpassed combined sales of cars with conventional diesel or gasoline engines.

5|$|Fred {{prompted}} a hurricane warning for Cape Verde <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> {{and was the}} first storm to pass through the islands as a hurricane since 1892. Strong winds there left about $2.5million in damage. Two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port. Seven other sailors likely drowned offshore Guinea-Bissau after their fishing boat collapsed. Tropical storms Grace, Henri, and Ida left negligible impact on land. Hurricane Joaquin's intensity and slow movement {{in the vicinity of the}} Bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands. Additionally, the American cargo ship SS El Faro went missing near Crooked Island and eventually capsized during the storm, drowning 33people. Rough seas in Haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning. Joaquin was the most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non-tropical origins. The remnants of Kate affected the British Isles, particularly Wales in the United Kingdom. Throughout the season, these storms collectively caused at least $730.4million in damage and 89deaths.|$|E

5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144.

In July 2016, Pirlo was {{included}} in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game. Pirlo finished his second MLS season with the club with one goal and a team seasonal best of eleven assists in 32 appearances, as New York City FC finished in second place in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever,</b> clinching a spot in the Eastern Conference semi-final. He was ruled out of the first leg, however, after sustaining a last-minute calf injury, and New York lost the match 2–0 away to Toronto FC. He appeared in the second leg on 6 November, as New York were eliminated from the Playoffs 7–0 on aggregate, following a 5–0 home defeat to Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army {{as a real}} threat, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering {{the same amount of}} foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed the core of this massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. They argue that Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While no definitive number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E

These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the United Kingdom after the 2012 Summer Olympics, and were the largest Paralympics ever: 4,302 athletes from 164 National Paralympic Committees participated, with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever.</b> A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games; {{for the first time since}} their suspension after the 2000 Paralympics, events for the intellectually disabled were also held in selected sports.|$|E

5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the Football League First Division and the FA Cup winners for the first time. The 1974 match was the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley Stadium as the Football Association (the FA) tried to revive {{the status of the}} match as a traditional season curtain-raiser by moving it to the country's showpiece venue. Furthermore, it was televised live <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> and the FA insisted on the champions and cup winners both taking part {{for the first time since}} 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{clinched}} {{their second}} consecutive playoff berth on March 25 in a 2–0 {{victory against the}} New Jersey Devils and earned the second-seed in the Eastern Conference. Two years removed from their last-place Eastern Conference finish in 2006, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever,</b> when they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, 4–2. The division championship was the first for the Penguins since winning the Northeast Division in 1998. It was the best finish by the team since finishing second in the 1997–98 season.

The Penguins raised banners for their top finish in the Atlantic Division and subsequent Eastern Conference playoff championship prior to the first Mellon Arena home game of the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Another team {{rose from}} the Pacific, as had Cobreloa. Colombian club América reached three {{consecutive}} finals in 1985, 1986 and 1987 but like Cobreloa they could not manage to win a single one. In 1985, Argentinos Juniors, a small club from the neighborhood of La Paternal in Buenos Aires, astonished South America by eliminating holders Independiente in La Doble Visera 2–1 during the last decisive match of the second round, to book {{a place in the}} final. Argentinos Juniors went on to win an unprecedented title by beating America de Cali in the play-off match via a penalty shootout. After the frustrations of 1966 and 1976, River Plate reached a third final in 1986 and were crowned champions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>ever</b> after winning both legs of the final series against America de Cali, 2–1 at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero and 1–0 at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. Peñarol won the Cup again in 1987 after beating America de Cali 2–1 in the decisive playoff; it proved to be their last hurrah in the international scene as Uruguayan football, in general, suffered a great decline {{at the end of the}} 1980s.
