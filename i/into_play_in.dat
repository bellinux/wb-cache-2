5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring {{the principle of}} cuius regio, eius religio <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects {{would be required to}} convert to his faith: his rule, his religion. Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented the very real possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and strategically placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory that carried with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main {{resonators}} of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the vocal tract. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance.|$|E

25|$|List of Illinois High School Association member {{conferences}} Note that, {{unlike some}} other {{states such as}} Iowa or Texas, Illinois' high school athletic conferences are not officially organized by the IHSA and have little bearing on playoff competition. Individual schools organize themselves into conferences, mostly {{as a way of}} making scheduling easier, and many schools choose to compete as independents. However, conference affiliation does come <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> football competition, as conference champions earn an automatic bid into the playoffs (football conferences must have at least six members for a champion to be automatically playoff-eligible). Football teams not affiliated in a conference can still qualify with six or more wins. Football competition is played with a nine-game schedule.|$|E
25|$|Penrose {{believes}} that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, {{and may be}} harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence {{because it is an}} algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because things such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.|$|E
25|$|In 220 BC Demetrius and the Illyrian commander, Scerdilaidas sailed {{south of}} Lissus with ninety lembi. After {{an assault on}} Pylos in the western Peloponnese had failed they {{separated}} their forces, with Demetrius taking his chances in plundering the Cyclades while Scerdilaidas returned north. On putting in at Naupactus with forty ships Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his broth-in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join the Aetolians in their planned invasion of Achaea. With help from Cynaethan traitors, they attacked, seized and burned Cynaetha, a town {{in the north of}} Arcadia, located on the northern slope of the Aroanian Mountains. They also attacked but failed to take Cleitor. Meanwhile, Demetrius continued on into the Aegean with 50 ships. He sailed to the Cyclades, where he extorted tribute from some of the islands and plundered the others. Chased by Rhodian warships, Demetrius put into Cenchreae, the Aegean port of Corinth. At the same time the Macedonian commander in Corinth, Taurion, learned of Scerdilaidas' and the Aetolians' invasion. Taking his cue from the Aetolians, Taurion agreed to drag Demetrius' ships across the Isthmus to bring them <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Corinth, in return for Demetrius' assistance against the Aetolians.

25|$|The {{theory of}} law as {{normative}} patterns in a normative field {{was developed by}} Anna Christensen {{in a number of}} published articles following the book Residential Right in the Tenement House (1994). The theory is based on the thesis that different basic normative patterns can be distinguished in the multitude of legal norms. As social life is quite complex, these normative patterns do not make up the ‘hierarchical legal system’ we frequently imagine. Instead, these patterns are being set <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> a normative field as determined by the different basic patterns, which also act as normative poles. Another component of the theoretical framework is the functional relationship between the legal system and the structure of society and conditions of economic production, elaborated in the work of Professor Ann Numhauser-Henning. The basic normative patterns are held to reflect normative practices functional to society and human relationships. They thus reflect – and codify – social normative conceptions and practices aimed at making long-lasting human relationships and sustainable societies possible, and they are closely related to societal conditions. Changes in the underlying conditions of production provide explanations for many of the movements in the normative field and the new legal institutions, which have arisen to satisfy fundamental normative demands. However, the basic normative patterns all represent enduring legitimate normative conceptions in society, and it is the task of legislators and courts to balance these conceptions within the framework of law.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes comes <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents {{may find that}} U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E

500|$|News of {{the pending}} {{marriage}} became public in late November 1582, {{but it was}} still unclear what Gebhard would do. Precedent suggested he would resign prior to his marriage, but rumors abounded that he would convert the Electorate to Protestantism, perhaps forcibly. Throughout the Electorate, and on its borders, his supporters and opponents gathered their troops, armed their garrisons, stockpiled food, and prepared for war. On 19December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion, from, as he phrased it, the [...] "darkness of the papacy to the Light" [...] of the Word of God. His proclamation of the Reformation from the Cathedral pulpit in the Imperial City of Cologne established Calvinism as a religious option in the Electorate. He also intended to convert the electorate into a dynastic property generated an uproar among the other Prince-electors. The transformation of an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy would then bring the principle of cuius regio, eius religio <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects would be required to convert to his faith: his rule, his religion.|$|E
500|$|In 1920 and afterwards, Ruth was aided in {{his power}} hitting {{by the fact that}} A.J. Reach Company—the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues—was using a more {{efficient}} machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went <b>into</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> 1920 and ushered the start of the live-ball era; the number of home runs across the major leagues increased by 184 over the previous year. Baseball statistician Bill James pointed out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the spitball (accelerated after the death of Ray Chapman, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death). Nevertheless, James theorized that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing at [...] any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs.|$|E
