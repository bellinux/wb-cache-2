5|$|Recognised native {{minority}} {{languages in}} Germany are Danish, Low German, Sorbian, Romany, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially {{protected by the}} European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian. <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim {{to be able to}} communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-seven million <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> {{members of}} a sports club and an {{additional}} twelve million pursue sports individually. Association football {{is the most popular}} sport. With more than 6.3million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest sports organisation of its kind worldwide, and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world. The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014, the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996, and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017. Germany hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 2006 and the UEFA European Championship in 1988.|$|E

50|$|In Southern Jutland {{in southwestern}} Denmark, <b>German</b> <b>is</b> also spoken by the North Schleswig <b>Germans,</b> and <b>German</b> <b>is</b> a {{recognized}} minority language in this region. <b>German</b> <b>is</b> the primary language among the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig, and likewise, Danish {{is the primary}} language of the North Schleswig Germans. Both minority groups are highly bilingual.|$|R

25|$|Tariq Ali {{made the}} same {{complaint}} in his survey of the reactions, {{in an article in}} Counterpunch, arguing that Grass had foreseen the reactions, and that criticism of his poem in Germany assumed that 'all <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> guilty for eternity for the crimes of the Third Reich'.|$|E
25|$|Just as this hill, {{where the}} <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> solidly entrenched, {{gives me a}} nasty feeling, solely because its gentle slopes are broken up by earthworks, which throw long shadows at sunset—just so shall I get feeling, of {{whatsoever}} definition, from a statue according to its slopes, varied to infinity.|$|E

50|$|High <b>German</b> <b>is</b> {{by now the}} {{dominant}} language but Low German in its Holsteinisch version still has a place in informal conversation. Until the 1960s Low <b>German</b> <b>was</b> the prevailing language of everyday communication. Most Ditmarsians born before 1960 still consider Low German their mother tongue. Low <b>German</b> <b>is</b> more common in rural regions than in urban regions {{and more likely to}} be spoken by older Ditmarsians.|$|R
25|$|Günther's work {{agreed with}} Grant's, and the German {{anthropologist}} frequently {{stated that the}} <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> definitely not a fully Nordic people. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The standard tripartite model placed most {{of the population of}} Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the Anschluss.|$|E
25|$|Could {{you let me}} know on one {{sheet of}} paper what {{arrangements}} you are making about the Channel Convoys now that the <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> all along the Channel coast? The attacks yesterday both from the air and by E-boats, were very serious, and I should like to be assured this morning {{that the situation is}} in hand and the Air is contributing effectively.|$|E
25|$|German {{nationalism}} is the nationalist idea that <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> a nation, promotes {{the unity of}} Germans into a nation state, and emphasizes and takes pride in the national identity of Germans. The earliest origins of German nationalism began {{with the birth of}} romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars when Pan-Germanism started to rise. Advocacy of a German nation state began to become an important political force in response to the invasion of German territories by France under Napoleon.|$|E

25|$|Sport {{forms an}} {{integral}} part of German life, as demonstrated by the fact that 27million <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> members of a sports club and an additional twelve million pursue such an activity individually. Football {{is by far the most}} popular sport, and the German Football Federation (Deutscher Fußballbund) with more than 6.3million members is the largest athletic organisation in the country. It also attracts the greatest audience, with hundreds of thousands of spectators attending Bundesliga matches and millions more watching on television.|$|E
25|$|Let bishops {{as well as}} priests {{observe the}} {{prescriptions}} of the Council of Trent concerning their households. All clerics should avoid idleness as a pest. (vii) Of ecclesiastical seminaries. The erection of preparatory as well as greater seminaries is recommended. Theology and philosophy, Scripture and Hebrew are to be taught in the latter. No student is to pass from one seminary to another without testimonial letters. In those dioceses where <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> found who cannot speak English, it is expedient that the seminarians learn enough German to hear confessions.|$|E
25|$|La Grande Illusion, a 1937 film by Jean Renoir, {{depicts the}} story of two French {{officers}} of the First World War sent to a prisoners’ camp in Germany. They decide to escape by digging a tunnel in perilous conditions. After several aborted escape attempts and repeated transfers, they are placed in a mountain fortress. The story does not portray negative characters: soldiers or guards, the <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> good guys, while the Allied prisoners perform their duties conscientiously but without excessive heroism. As shown, the prisoners’ camps of 1914-18 do not give the impression of a frightening inferno (at least the officers’ camps).|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>German</b> <b>is</b> {{spoken by}} around 500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, though the number {{may be as}} high as 3,800,000 {{according}} to some sources. <b>German</b> <b>is</b> the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.|$|R
50|$|Before repatriation, the <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> {{required}} to remain {{and clean up}} {{after five years of}} occupation. There <b>were</b> 180 <b>German</b> minefields in Rogaland, with a total of 480,000 mines, all of which the <b>German</b> Wehrmacht <b>were</b> {{required to}} clear. 62 <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> killed and 94 were injured during mine clearance in Rogaland.|$|R

25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} {{that it would take}} more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> approaching the limit of their resources”.|$|E
25|$|The {{casualties}} {{inflicted by}} the 395th Infantry Regiment, 99th Division, on the <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> {{reflected by the}} disproportionate numbers of dead and wounded. The 395th hit the Germans with such terrific small arms and machine gun fire that they couldn't even remove their dead and wounded in their rapid retreat. The accurate fire from the twelve 3-inch guns of A Company, 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was instrumental in keeping German tanks from advancing. During {{the first day of}} the Battle of the Bulge, the 3rd Battalion took 19 prisoners and killed an estimated 200 Germans. Accurate estimates of German wounded were not possible, but about 20 percent of the 326th Volksgrenadier Division were lost. The 395th's casualties were extremely light: four dead, seven wounded, and four men missing.|$|E
25|$|In the story, March {{meets with}} Charlotte 'Charlie' Maguire, a female American {{journalist}} also determined {{to investigate the}} case. They both travel to Zürich to investigate the private Swiss bank account {{of one of the}} murdered officials. Ultimately, the two uncover the truth behind the staged murders: Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the SS, has ordered the Gestapo to eliminate the remaining officials who planned the Final Solution (of which few <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> aware) at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. The elimination is being hurried to safeguard an upcoming meeting of Hitler and United States President Joseph P. Kennedy by ensuring that the fate of Europe's Jews can never be revealed. Maguire heads for neutral Switzerland, hoping to expose the evidence of the extermination to the world. March, however, is denounced by his ten-year-old son and apprehended by the Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|<b>German</b> <b>is</b> the {{official}} and predominant spoken language in Germany. Standard <b>German</b> <b>is</b> a West Germanic language and {{is closely related}} to and classified alongside Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans, Frisian and English. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the North Germanic languages. Most <b>German</b> vocabulary <b>is</b> derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). <b>German</b> <b>is</b> written using the Latin alphabet.|$|R

500|$|The <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> {{depicted}} {{with little}} difference between them, {{but there is}} great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story.

500|$|When {{you listen}} to the Sex Pistols, to [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] and [...] "Bodies" [...] and tracks like that, what {{immediately}} strikes you is that this is actually happening. [...] This is a bloke, with a brain on his shoulders, who is actually saying something he sincerely believes is happening in the world, saying it with real venom, and real passion. [...] It touches you and it scares you; it makes you feel uncomfortable. [...] It's like somebody saying [...] "The <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> coming! [...] And there's no way we're gonna stop 'em! ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>Germans</b> <b>are</b> {{waiting with}} loudhailers and orders {{to head for}} a hot bath. Wiesel is desperate for {{the heat of the}} water, but his father sinks into the snow.

I yelled against the wind...I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen." [...] An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.|$|E

50|$|About 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, {{according}} to the 2000 census. From 1860-1917, <b>German</b> <b>was</b> widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see German in the United States.
