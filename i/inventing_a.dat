5|$|Four {{people have}} {{received}} two Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 {{for her work}} on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium, making her {{the only person to}} be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. Linus Pauling was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity. Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> method of determining base sequences in DNA.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} naval battles were {{disasters}} for Rome. However, after training more sailors and <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> grappling engine, a Roman naval force {{was able to}} defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval victories followed. The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army. He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy. The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient financial means to raise one. For a maritime power {{the loss of their}} access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace.|$|E
50|$|He {{teamed with}} Walrath in 1880 to form Lipe-Walrath Company and <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> broom-sewing machine and by 1885 <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> cigar-box making machine.|$|R
50|$|Edison's {{method was}} to invent systems rather than {{components}} of systems. Edison did not just <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> light bulb, he <b>invented</b> <b>an</b> economically viable system of lighting including its generators, cables, metering and so on.|$|R
50|$|Litke <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{wireless}} microphone in 1957 while employed as an electronics expert at San Jose State College. His supervisor challenged him to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> microphone {{to use in}} educational presentations which would be free of wires.|$|R
5|$|Upon death, Avatar Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, {{and later}} raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at the Southern Air Temple {{and friend of}} the late Avatar Roku. Even prior to {{learning}} he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by {{becoming one of the}} youngest Airbending Masters in history by <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples. Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century.|$|E
25|$|Until 1799, politicians, {{apart from}} <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> new {{parliamentary}} system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading {{the people from}} Catholicism and from royalism.|$|E
25|$|The 1943 British film Get Cracking starred George Formby as a Home Guard lance {{corporal}} who is constantly losing and winning back his stripe. Formby's platoon {{is involved in}} rivalry with the Home Guard sections of the local villages Major Wallop and Minor Wallop. At {{the end of the}} film Formby is promoted to sergeant after <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> secret weapon– a home-made tank.|$|E
50|$|He did {{important}} {{work in the}} development of high-pressure cloud chambers for the study of neutrons produced by accelerators. He <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> neutron-counter-ratio technique for the determination of neutron emission thresholds. He also <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> sphere-moderated neutron spectrometer.|$|R
5000|$|Everett <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{system of}} {{shorthand}} which he published (1877 and 1883); and, <b>a</b> pioneer cyclist, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> spring hub attachment for the spokes of bicycle wheels. He also introduced the so-called [...] "gridiron" [...] slide rule, in 1866.|$|R
50|$|In 1877 Francis Blake <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> carbon {{microphone}} {{for use in}} the telephone, shortly after Thomas Edison <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> microphone that also used carbon contacts. Blake used a carbon button design that initially would not stay in adjustment, but with later improvements proved to be workable. Alexander Graham Bell hired Blake and put him to work with Emile Berliner who also <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{carbon microphone}}. The improved Berliner-Blake microphone was standard with the Bell company for many years.|$|R
25|$|Pfizer {{acquired}} Warner–Lambert in 2000 for $111.8billion. Warner–Lambert {{was founded}} as a Philadelphia drug store in 1856 by William R. Warner. <b>Inventing</b> <b>a</b> tablet-coating process gained Warner {{a place in}} the Smithsonian Institution. Parke–Davis was founded in Detroit in 1866 by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976, and acquired Wilkinson Sword in 1993 and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Ida Freund (15 April 1863 – 15 May 1914) was {{the first}} woman to be a {{university}} chemistry lecturer in the United Kingdom.

25|$|Abraham Lincoln's patent is {{a patent}} for an {{invention}} to lift boats over shoals and obstructions in a river. It {{is the only}} United States patent ever registered to a President of the United States. Lincoln conceived the idea of <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that would lift a boat over shoals and obstructions when on two different occasions the boat on which he traveled got hung up on obstructions. Documentation of this patent was discovered in 1997.|$|E

25|$|In the Encyclopaedia Judaica article {{written by}} Professor Gershom Scholem of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem {{there is an}} {{extensive}} discussion of the sources cited in the Zohar. Scholem views {{the author of the}} Zohar as having based the Zohar {{on a wide variety of}} pre-existing Jewish sources, while at the same time <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> number of fictitious works that the Zohar supposedly quotes, e.g., the Sifra de-Adam, the Sifra de-Hanokh, the Sifra di-Shelomo Malka, the Sifra de-Rav Hamnuna Sava, the Sifra de-Rav Yeiva Sava, the Sifra de-Aggadeta, the Raza de-Razin and many others.|$|E
25|$|According to the myth-ritual theory, myth {{is tied to}} ritual. In {{its most}} extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals. This claim was first put forward by Smith, who claimed that people begin {{performing}} rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth. Frazer claimed that humans {{started out with a}} belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.|$|E
25|$|The same year, Duchamp also {{attended}} {{a performance of}} a stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's 1910 novel, Impressions d'Afrique which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Work on The Large Glass continued into 1913, with his invention of <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas {{on the wall of}} his apartment.|$|E
50|$|Chasey <b>invented,</b> <b>a</b> Stabilometer Computerized Analog Recording System (SCARS), {{through a}} grant from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in 1974. He <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> Serial Stacker for Measuring Gross Motor Learning by Young Retarded Children, through a Biomedical Research Grant, from the National Institutes of Health in 1973. Chasey, along with James Hogge, <b>invented,</b> <b>A</b> Curve Smoothing Program for Plotting a Predictive Value for a Polynomial Fitted for an IBM 1130 Computer, through {{a grant from}} the Joseph P.

25|$|Inoue did not patent his {{invention}} {{and so did}} not directly profit from the invention that started a booming industry. He did continue in the field, <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> pesticide to repel cockroaches and rats that destroy the electronics within karaoke machines. In the 1980s, he ran a business engaged in securing licensing for music in eight-track karaoke machines. In the 1990s, with eight-track karaoke out of use, Inoue turned his company towards working with Daiichikosho, then the top karaoke company, but though he was earning considerable money {{as chairman of the}} company left it when he suffered a period of depression. Subsequently, Inoue launched the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.|$|E
25|$|GEC {{was working}} on {{producing}} a fully sealed version of the magnetron, as opposed to one that used an external vacuum pump. After <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> new sealing method using gold wire and adapting the chamber of a Colt revolver as a drilling template, they produced the E1188 in early July 1940. This produced {{the same amount of}} power as the original Randall-Boot model, about 1kW at around 10cm. Within a few weeks they had made two improvements, moving from six to eight resonators, and replacing the cathode with an oxide-coated version. The resulting E1189 was capable of generating 10kW of power at 9.1cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. The second E1189 was sent to the AMRE lab, which received it on 19 July.|$|E
25|$|Harold Bolton Redler {{was born}} in West Monkton, Somerset, the eldest son of Daniel Bolton Redler and Annie Pethick (née Crocker). Redler's {{grandfather}} Thomas John Redler, was a grain merchant and miller. Around 1900 Daniel and his brother Arnold {{broke away from the}} family business to form their own company Daniel Redler & Co. Ltd., initially at the City Flour Mill, Worcester, but then moved to Sharpness, Gloucestershire, in 1909. The brothers later went their separate ways; with Arnold <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> system of handling bulk materials, and later founding the Redler company, now part of the Schenck Process Group, while Daniel relocated to South Africa, where he was a {{founder and director of the}} Tiger Oats & National Milling Co.

25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father {{in a place called}} Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding to rewind the armature and convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E
