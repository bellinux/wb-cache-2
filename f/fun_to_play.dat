5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt {{little more than an}} extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist. Drew Barrymore returned as Jillian, and Lauren Conrad and Audrina Patridge guest starred as themselves. In her second guest appearance on the series, Conrad played a smart version of herself, which she proclaimed as being <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> She took the recording sessions seriously and did not do any improvisation with her lines. The show's staff was ultimately impressed with her performance, and series creator Seth MacFarlane praised her stamina and how prepared she was before the recording sessions. The episode also featured live-action sequences with talk show hosts Jay Leno, Craig Ferguson and Jimmy Fallon.|$|E
5|$|Prakash Raj and Ashish Vidyarthi {{were cast}} as the film's primary antagonists. Raj played a mafia kingpin and Vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer, a villain's role he finds more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{than that of a}} hero. Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana played the role of the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema. Isai and Subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well, with the former also making his debut in Telugu cinema. Ali played the role of a beggar and shared screen-space with Brahmanandam and Venu Madhav. Jagannadh added this trio to the film to provide situational humour. Master Bharath played the role of D'Cruz's brother. Mumaith Khan performed an item number in the film.|$|E

She {{explained}} [...] "It's so much <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> such a free spirited character. I like that she's matured and thinks a little clearer now that she is older, but I don't think Tash could ever become boring, {{no matter how much}} she matures." ...|$|R

25|$|Goichi Suda {{stated that}} he would not mind seeing Travis appear in the Super Smash Bros. series. Joystiq editor Randy Nelson agreed, stating that he would love to see Travis with his beam katana in the next title. Destructoid editor Jim Sterling {{stated that he}} would love to see Travis {{included}} just by the virtue that it is a creation of Suda's, who he is a fan of. He commented that the close relationship between Suda and Hideo Kojima, whose character Solid Snake is already in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, makes it possible that he could appear. Inc Gamers editor Tim McDonald described Travis as a good fit for the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Kombo editor David Oxford stated that while {{he did not want to}} see the cast of the Super Smash Bros. series diluted by third party characters, he could easily see Travis not only fitting into the series, but being <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with. Escapist Magazine editor Keane Ng expressed the opinion that while the two third party characters included in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, were highly popular characters, Travis is an unlikely character due to being far less recognizable. He added that while Snake was from a Mature-rated video game, he fit in well; Travis' personality would make him too difficult to include, despite his fighting style being similar to other Smash Bros. characters. As such Travis Touchdown was not added to the final cut of the game.|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness.

5000|$|IGN's Giancarlo Varanini {{thought that}} the game had a {{promising}} concept but the end result was disappointing: [...] "It's just not a very <b>fun</b> game <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> and unless you're absolutely desperate for something to take up your time, it should probably be avoided." ...|$|R
500|$|Jack DeVries, who {{reviewed}} Green Day: Rock Band for IGN, enjoyed having complete albums in the game, but {{was disappointed}} by the low number of songs in the game, especially from the albums between Dookie and American Idiot, saying that [...] "Nearly all of Green Day's albums went platinum and I'd like a much larger representation from all of them." [...] Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera praised the selection of songs, saying they [...] "fit with the gameplay of Rock Band very well". Some reviewers, such as GamePro's Mitch Dyer, were {{disappointed by the}} focus on Green Day's newer songs. Several reviewers were critical of the setlist, feeling that the songs were not <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> or were too easy. Others praised the songs chosen, saying that songs such as [...] "F.O.D." [...] provide the game with musical variety, {{and that they are}} <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on all the instruments. Reviewers criticized the game's use of radio edits, with Kuchera calling the editing [...] "a bummer". DeVries likewise felt that [...] "given how much these boys love to drop f-bombs, [...] makes the songs sound funny." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times review concluded, [...] "Sure, it's <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> looks {{spectacular}} and {{is easy to}} control.

[...] The New York Times reviewer described it as: [...] "intelligent, gorgeous, occasionally frightening" [...] and added, [...] "Anchored by its provocative, morality-based story line, sumptuous art direction and superb voice acting, BioShock can also hold its head high among the best games ever made." ...|$|E

500|$|Overall, Gold and Silver were stated to be solid gaming {{additions}} {{that would}} please a large audience. [...] "After {{playing the game}} dozens of hours, I really can't think of a bad point to make about Pokémon Gold and Silver. Nintendo and Game Freak have tweaked the original and built a sequel that's long, challenging and tremendous <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> There's a reason why Pokémon is so popular, and Pokémon Gold and Silver {{is going to help}} the series move further into the 21st century", said Harris.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} Steve Jackson Games editions of Ogre (after the {{designer}} had {{moved away from}} Metagaming), Tony Watson called Ogre [...] "a legend {{in the ranks of}} SF gamedom, and deservedly so... as well as being a lot of <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> it's an interesting extrapolation on high-tech armoured warfare". It was noted that the rules had remained essentially the same in the new edition, and the most significant changes being to the physical design—with larger (still black and white) counters, and full colour maps by Denis Loubet. [...] Watson also welcomed the retention of the original artwork alongside new pieces—"no one draws a GEV or Ogre like Mr. Chung".|$|E

The song selection was criticized by some reviewers who felt that many important Green Day songs, especially from Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning, were absent from the game. Others praised the inclusion of complete albums in the game and thought they were <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

500|$|Review did {{note that}} the [...] "Top 40" [...] songs do not always make for {{challenging}} songs, as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre-programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats. However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that would be <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Reviews {{also noted that the}} censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E

She then appeared in the 2011 film Mr. Popper's Penguins, opposite Jim Carrey.

500|$|The Game Boy Color port {{received}} mixed reviews. Concluding {{that the}} port is an [...] "abridged {{edition of the}} overall game", Craig Harris of IGN criticized the version's great lack of the PC version's features (e.g. weapons) and personality and pointed out its [...] "quirky" [...] graphics. The reviewer felt that the game's front end was [...] "extremely thrown together". However, he concluded that it was still <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Chris Hudak of The Electric Playground similarly criticized the lack of weapons and also criticized the great lack of sound bytes and complete lack of voices and what he perceived to be [...] "microscopic" [...] worms that are tough for the eye to see. He did, however, praise the terrain and physics engine for being well translated from the other versions of the game.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} both her {{character}} and the show, Brewster said: [...] "You know, I'm on the third season now of the original Dallas. It's just so much <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch. When I saw our pilot, I got so emotional when the theme song came on. It's like you're {{a part of something}} so iconic. I just hope the fans of the original series like watching the new generation interact with Bobby and J.R. Ewing and Sue Ellen. It's kind of like what happens with Fast and the Furious, you get to pick up where characters left off and you get to see them evolve. There is still family drama playing out, there are those who still care about money more than anything and those who care about the family more than anything. There are those age-old themes that are so much <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch <b>play</b> out. I'm in a love triangle between John Ross Jr. (Josh Henderson) and Christopher (Jesse Metcalfe). I grew up with the boys on the ranch, so I'm very familiar with their antics. It's a really <b>fun,</b> juicy role <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> I'm also an engineer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave Shockwave Supernova {{four stars}} out of five, calling it [...] "proud egghead music that grooves {{on its own}} {{technical}} acumen" [...] and that it [...] "feels like a collaborative record; it's as <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> hear Satriani <b>play</b> with his band {{as it is to}} hear him soar on his own." ...|$|R
500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} mode received mixed response. Carter {{compared the}} competitive multiplayer {{to that of}} Tomb Raider, and called it [...] "skippable". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game {{would still be a}} strong title without these multiplayer elements. Bertz from Game Informer also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers. Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget. In contrast, GameZone's Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was [...] "a surprise" [...] for him. Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.|$|E
500|$|Of her {{gameplay}} mechanics, Inquisitr {{expressed the}} opinion that her [...] "quick and evasive ways make her an annoyance to deal with". ESPN described her as [...] "the classic in-and-out harasser", referring to her speed and her ability to blink and recall, and also reported that [...] "she was used a lot more before a health nerf late in the beta". Mike Minotti of VentureBeat opined that: [...] "Tracer [...] a lot of <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Her whole teleporting/rewinding mechanics [...] so unique and fast-paced. I feel like [...] {{done a great job}} making a varied, relatively balanced cast." [...] In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Tracer #8 out of the 24 playable characters in Overwatch, expressing that [...] "a good Tracer that goes unchecked can wreak havoc on the back-lines, causing teams to fold before they even know what's happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception towards Spartan Ops {{was less}} {{favorable}} than multiplayer and campaign; some reviewers expressed their disappointment in Spartan Ops replacing the cooperative Firefight mode. Criticisms {{were aimed at}} the brevity of missions and lack of replay value. Despite any shortcomings, IGN said the mode was a must-play for the [...] "incredible pre-episode cinematics" [...] which open up [...] "a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons." [...] Martin Robinson of Eurogamer complained about the repetition of environments within {{the first half of}} the season and noted that missions quickly become a chore. [...] He felt that Spartan Ops was a [...] "weak, bloated alternative" [...] compared to Firefight. [...] 1UP.com found that while the short length felt odd initially, the mode was still <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> and offered more opportunities to play Halo cooperatively.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2001/2002, Welsh {{returned}} to the Boston music scene by temporarily joining Nate Albert's (guitarist for The Mighty Mighty Bosstones) band, The Kickovers.

5000|$|... "It’s {{time to go}} back to an {{idealized}} president—a well-articulated and idealized president," [...] said Howard Gordon. [...] "Her greatest flaw is her idealism.

Cherry Jones plays the president brilliantly," [...] he continued.|$|R
5000|$|Tom King of Adventure Gamers {{rated the}} game 3 out of 5, and praised its fun {{gameplay}} and colorful graphics, but also called it, [...] "Very easy, and extremely short." [...] King wrote, [...] "The replay value is moderate to low; {{it took some}} 3.5 hours for me to complete, and although the game is certainly <b>fun</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>play</b> more than once, you're {{not going to see}} anything different. Were this game just a little longer, I would add a half-star to the score." ...|$|R
