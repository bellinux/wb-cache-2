5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> undisturbed. Holst and {{his family moved to}} a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

Then {{he went back to}} his work-room, and took up the broken model from the bench. But <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> at it now, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> at anything; he began to walk up and down the floor.|$|R

5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with, expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved up to the front and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time acclimatising.|$|E
25|$|Kurt Russell lifted {{weights and}} began running {{two months before}} {{production}} began {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week's rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes. 20th Century Fox was afraid that the production would create major overruns and hired Carpenter to direct because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> fast. He was given only 10 weeks of pre-production.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{discussions with}} impresario Natale Fabbrici about employing a Venetian librettist, Pietro Beltrame. However, {{not only did}} the composer prefer to work with a librettist known to him and with whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> in close proximity, but he had already begun working with Cammarano who was revising - to the composer's satisfaction - an earlier version of Belisario which the librettist had submitted to the Teatro San Carlo management in 1832.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{with their}} {{finances}} improving, Vaughan and Treadwell purchased a three-story house on 21 Avon Avenue in Newark, occupying {{the top floor}} during their increasingly rare off-hours at home and relocating Vaughan's parents to the lower two floors. However, business pressures and personality conflicts led to a cooling in Treadwell and Vaughan's relationship. Treadwell hired a road manager to handle Vaughan's touring needs, and opened a management office in Manhattan so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with clients in addition to Vaughan.|$|E
25|$|Holliday {{moved to}} St. Louis, Missouri, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> as an {{assistant}} for a classmate, A. Jameson Fuches, Jr. Less than four months later, {{at the end of}} July, he relocated to Atlanta, where he joined a dental practice. He lived with his uncle and his family so he could begin to build up his dental practice. A few weeks before Holliday's birthday, dentist Arthur C. Ford advertised in the Atlanta papers that Holliday would substitute for him while he was attending dental meetings.|$|E
25|$|After his resignation, {{he found}} a job at Salah Farhat's lawyer office. Bourguiba, who only wanted a place where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> did not ask Farhat, {{who was at the}} time deputy {{chairman}} of the Destour, for money but for a working place. Nevertheless, he worked all summer at Farhat's and had a salary of 300 francs per month. He soon met a worker at the office of a certain Mr. Sebault. This one engaged Bourguiba for 600 francs per month which led Bourguiba to work another year more than the three mandatory ones..|$|E

25|$|According to some biographers, {{near the}} end of Murrow's life, when health {{problems}} forced him to resign from the USIA, Paley reportedly invited Murrow to return to CBS. Murrow, possibly knowing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work,</b> declined Paley's offer.|$|R
50|$|David Kaye said at TFcon 2010 {{that the}} creators {{wanted to get}} Scott McNeil to voice Waspinator, but since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> in the US without a permit, {{they were unable to}} get him to reprise his role.|$|R
25|$|In 1045, Alfasi {{moved to}} Fes {{with his wife}} and two children. Fes' Jewish {{community}} undertook to support him and his family so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on his Sefer Ha-halachot undisturbed. They also founded a yeshiva in his honor, and many students throughout Morocco came to study under his guidance. The most famous of his many students is Rabbi Judah Halevi, author of the Kuzari; he also taught Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash (the Ri Migash), who was in turn a teacher of Rabbi Maimon, father and teacher of Maimonides (Rambam).|$|E
25|$|Outside of Southern California, Vin Scully {{is remembered}} as NBC television's lead {{baseball}} broadcaster from 1983 to 1989. Besides calling the Saturday Game of the Week for NBC, Scully called three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988), four National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and four All-Star Games (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home {{games on the}} radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> for NBC.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Australia in 1929. During this period, Jörgensen enjoyed considerable success both in Paris and London, with exhibitions at several major galleries including being hung {{at the prestigious}} Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in both 1926 and 1927, a rare honor for an Australian. The influences of this period in Europe are apparent both in his painting and in the architecture of Montsalvat. Jörgensen bought a home and studio in the Melbourne bayside suburb of Brighton and later leased an old warehouse in Queen Street, Melbourne as his city studio where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> and teach.|$|E

50|$|He {{studied at}} the Polytechnic Institute, then at the Faculty of Oriental Studies Saint Petersburg State University. He did not finish his education; because of the severe form of {{tuberculosis}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> anywhere else and almost never left the house.|$|R
25|$|In 1959 Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, moving {{eventually}} {{into a large}} hillside villa at Kapuzinerstraße 9, {{which was}} his main residence {{for the rest of}} his life. Robert Piencikowski suggests a number of reasons for the move to Germany: excellent rehearsal conditions with the South-West German Radio orchestra, with which he had an arrangement to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts; an electronic studio where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on a new piece (Poésie pour pouvoir); but also disenchantment with the cultural and political climate in France under de Gaulle at the time of the Algerian war.|$|E
25|$|Portman spent {{significant}} {{time out}} of the United States negotiating trade agreements with roughly 30 countries, visiting Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, South Korea, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During his tenure, Portman also helped to win passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Portman utilized a network of former House colleagues to get support for the treaty to lift trade barriers between the United States and Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras. According to The Hill, Portman took his wife, Jane, {{with him to the}} Capitol on their wedding anniversary so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on the deal.|$|E
25|$|Combined Operations {{requested}} a small production run of De Lisle carbines and an initial batch of 17 were hand–made by Ford Dagenham, with Godfray De Lisle himself released from his Air Ministry duties so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> full-time on the project; this initial batch was immediately put into combat {{use by the}} British Commandos. In 1944, the Sterling Armaments Company was given an order for 500 De Lisle carbines, but eventually only produced around 130. The Sterling version differed {{in a number of}} details from the earlier, Ford Dagenham model. Two prototypes of a further version, for Airborne forces, were made. These had folding stocks, similar to those fitted to the Sterling submachine gun.|$|E

50|$|Special {{effects for}} the film were rather basic and {{involved}} monitor lizards, iguanas, and crocodiles affixed with miniature horns and fins. Director Allen later stated that though he wanted stop motion models, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>work</b> with lizards and live creatures {{in accordance with the}} studio's budget.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange. His commitment to the Cars album meant that he told Def Leppard <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> on their album, Hysteria. However, due to delays in that album's recording, Lange was eventually able to produce it.|$|R
25|$|His {{position}} in the ruling family gave him access to archival materials that were inaccessible to the public, {{and he had the}} privilege of having these items delivered from the state archives to his home where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on them in the comfort of his own study. He also accumulated an extensive library, both in his St Petersburg palace and in his rural estate, Borjomi, where he liked to work undisturbed. His great wealth enabled him to have a number of research assistants, a luxury seldom available to most historians. His most valuable helper with his historical work was Constantine Brummer, his aide-de-camp since the earliest years of his military career who was his loyal friend until the end.|$|E
25|$|Stravinsky {{formed a}} {{business}} and musical relationship with the French piano manufacturing company Pleyel. Pleyel essentially acted as his agent in collecting mechanical royalties for his works and provided him with a monthly income and a studio space at its headquarters in which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> and entertain friends and business acquaintances. Under the terms of his contract with the company, Stravinsky agreed to arrange (and to some extent re-compose) many of his early works for the Pleyela, Pleyel's brand of player piano. He did {{so in a way}} that made full use of all of the piano's eighty-eight notes, without regard for human fingers or hands. The rolls were not recorded, but were instead marked up from a combination of manuscript fragments and handwritten notes by Jacques Larmanjat, musical director of Pleyel's roll department. Among the compositions that were issued on the Pleyela piano rolls are the Rite of Spring, Petrushka, the Firebird and Song of the Nightingale. During the 1920s, Stravinsky recorded Duo-Art rolls for the Aeolian Company in both London and New York, not all of which have survived.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, Tchaikovsky wrote four concertos (three for piano, one for violin), two concertante {{works for}} soloist and {{orchestra}} (one each for piano and cello) {{and a couple}} of short works. The First Piano Concerto, while faulted traditionally for having its opening melody in the wrong key and never restating that tune {{in the rest of the}} piece, shows an expert use of tonal instability to enhance tension and increase the tone of restlessness and high drama. The Violin Concerto, one of Tchaikovsky's freshest-sounding and least pretentious works, is filled with melodies that could have easily come from one of his ballets. The Second Piano Concerto, more formal in tone and less extroverted than the First, contains prominent solos for violin and cello in its slow movement, giving the impression of a concerto grosso for piano trio and orchestra. The Third Piano Concerto, initially the opening movement of a symphony in E flat, was left on Tchaikovsky's death as a single-movement composition. Tchaikovsky also promised a concerto for cello to Anatoliy Brandukov and one for flute to Paul Taffanel but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on either project in earnest.|$|E
