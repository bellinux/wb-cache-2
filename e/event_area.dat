50|$|Threshold based {{detection}} is {{a simple}} way events may be detected {{through the use of}} various parameters that can hint as to whether an event has occurred or not. Data collected at a sensor node, also called the data-event, is analyzed to see if it has reached a certain threshold point to be considered an event. For example, a light detector may only report back to a gateway if it detects light above a certain intensity. The data-event can be also be the result of a combination of outputs from different types of sensors that either collaborate at the gateway or through small hop peer-to-peer communication. Two important parameters that affect the effectiveness of the detection is sampling rate and <b>event</b> <b>area.</b> The sampling rate will depend on whether events occur {{over long periods of time}} like tides in the ocean or over short periods of time such as cars passing a building. The <b>event</b> <b>area</b> will determine how many sensors need to report values above a threshold value for the likelihood of an event to be high enough to be considered.|$|E
