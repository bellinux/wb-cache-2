5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details.

He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory {{started on}} June 21, 2004 at Pinewood Studios in England. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult {{because they were}} simultaneously working on Corpse Bride. The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> hours a day, filming for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.|$|E

When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> years.|$|E
