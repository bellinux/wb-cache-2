50|$|Some of the {{multiple}} activities of thymosin Î²4 unrelated to actin may be mediated by a tetrapeptide enzymically-cleaved from its N-terminus, N-acetyl-ser-asp-lys-pro, brand names Seraspenide or <b>Goralatide,</b> best known as an inhibitor of the proliferation of haematopoietic (blood-cell precursor) stem cells of bone marrow.|$|E
40|$|The tetrapeptide AcSDKP (<b>Goralatide)</b> is a {{cytokine}} {{with known}} inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, Many purging agents used in autologous {{bone marrow transplantation}} protocols, including hyperthermia, preferentially kill cycling cells. A pretreatment with <b>Goralatide</b> offers a possibility to reduce the haemotoxicity in many purging settings. The impact of <b>Goralatide</b> on the hyperthermic purging protocol was investigated in normal and myeloid leukaemic (SA 8) murine cells. The median survival time after transplantation (i. e. leukaemia incidences) {{was used as an}} in vivo parameter to determine the effects on leukaemic cells. The hyperthermic effect on normal and leukaemic cells was also investigated in vitro using the cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay. A heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C resulted in a 4 -log depletion of leukaemic stem cells. For normal progenitor cells (CFU-GM) a 2 -log cell kill was shown. The reduction in proliferative activity of the CFU-GM after an 8 h incubation with 10 (- 9) M <b>Goralatide</b> resulted in a decrease in the heat sensitivity of the progenitor subset to approximately a 1 -log cell kill, The leukaemic precursor cells seem insensitive to <b>Goralatide</b> inhibition, implicating an increase in the therapeutic window of the hyperthermic purging protocol. Finally, simulated remission bone marrow (5 % leukaemic blasts) was incubated with <b>Goralatide</b> followed by a heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C. Lethally irradiated (10 Gy) mice transplanted with heat-treated remission bone marrow (10 (6) normal bone marrow cells versus 5 x 10 (4) leukaemic cells) died of aplasia while Goralatide-pretreated remission bone marrow could rescue the irradiated mice without revealing leukaemic engraftment, These findings confirmed the enhanced protection against hyperthermia of the normal haemopoietic subsets by <b>Goralatide</b> and thus increased the success of the hyperthermic purging protocol...|$|E
40|$|Hyperthermic purging {{procedures}} may {{be improved}} by methods that selectively inhibit the proliferative activity of normal hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, since active proliferation of these subsets is accompanied by increased heat sensitivity. For this reason, bone marrow cells from CBA/H mice were incubated with <b>Goralatide</b> (tetrapeptide Acetyl-N-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro), a well-known inhibitor of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle. Subsequently, the cell suspensions were heat-treated at 43 degrees C for up to 90 minutes. After an exposure of 8 hours to 10 (- 9) M <b>Goralatide,</b> the number of CFU-GM cells in S phase decreased from 30 to 10 %, resulting in an almost 10 -fold increase in survival after 90 minutes at 43 degrees C. No effect on the primitive subsets could be detected because of their quiescent cell cycle state in normal bone marrow. To investigate the potential vulnerability of these subsets for <b>Goralatide,</b> bone marrow cells from 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) -pretreated mice were used. 5 -FU induced increase in proliferative activity of the CFU-S- 12 (day- 12 colony-forming units-spleen), and the stem cell with marrow repopulating ability could be abolished by an incubation period with 10 (- 9) M <b>Goralatide</b> for 16 and 24 hours, respectively. Hence, this decrease in proliferative activity confers a decrease in hyperthermic sensitivity for the primitive hematopoietic subsets. The cytotoxic effect of the incubation on the absolute number of the hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells was < 10 %. <b>Goralatide</b> treatment (10 (- 8), 10 (- 9), and 10 (- 10) M) up to 24 hours {{had no effect on}} the growth kinetics and cell cycle distribution and consequently on the hyperthermic sensitivity of L 1210 cells. Based on these results, it can be concluded that <b>Goralatide</b> will {{have a positive effect on}} the survival of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells after hyperthermia and may lead to a gain in the therapeutic window of this purging modality...|$|E
40|$|Recurrence {{of leukemia}} {{is a major}} problem after {{autologous}} stem cell transplantation. One potential means of reducing this risk is to purge the autologous transplant in vitro by hyperthermia, We have demonstrated that after a hyperthermic treatment of 120 min at 43 degrees C, the leukemic progenitor cells (CFU-AML) are decreased by 5 -log but the normal hematopoietic committed progenitor cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E) are reduced by only 1 -log, Moreover, the hyperthermic sensitivity coincides with the stem cell hierarchy, ie CFU-GM are less heat sensitive than BFU-E, while CFU-E are the most sensitive, The impact of pretreatment with the tetrapeptide AcSDKP (<b>Goralatide)</b> on the proliferative activity and heat sensitivity of the normal and leukemic progenitor cells was determined, An incubation of 21 h at 37 degrees C with 10 (- 9) M <b>Goralatide</b> reduces the number of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in S-phase and concomitantly decreases their hyperthermic sensitivity. This effect implies that the proliferative activity is the major determinant for the detected differences in hyperthermic sensitivity of the subsets in the normal hematopoietic stem cell compartment. In contrast, the cell cycle progression of leukemic progenitor cells is not affected and hence these cells are not protected from hyperthermia-induced cell killing after preincubation with <b>Goralatide.</b> Thus, the treatment with <b>Goralatide</b> increases the therapeutic window of hyperthermia and increases the potential value of this physical purging technique...|$|E
