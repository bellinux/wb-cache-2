5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
