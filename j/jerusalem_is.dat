5|$|<b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|The Armenian dialect {{spoken in}} <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> highly distinctive, {{because it was}} {{geographically}} relatively isolated {{from the rest of}} the Armenian-speaking world, and Arabic has a significant influence on it. Those Armenians whose ancestors came from Turkey following the 1915 genocide speak Turkish-influenced Western Armenian.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} fourth century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in Jerusalem {{as early as the}} fourth century, after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the fifth century. <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|Most notably, from 313 to 316 {{bishops in}} North Africa {{struggled}} with other Christian bishops {{who had been}} ordained by Donatus in opposition to Caecilian. The African bishops could not come to terms and the Donatists asked Constantine {{to act as a}} judge in the dispute. Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the Donatism movement in North Africa. In 317 Constantine issued an edict to confiscate Donatist church property and to send Donatist clergy into exile. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> so classified), most known for its dealing with Arianism and for instituting the Nicene Creed.|$|E

50|$|The {{annexation}} of East <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>was</b> met with international criticism. The Israeli Foreign Ministry disputes that the {{annexation of}} <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>was</b> {{a violation of}} international law. The final status of <b>Jerusalem</b> has <b>been</b> {{one of the most}} important areas of discord between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators for peace. Areas of discord have included whether the Palestinian flag can be raised over areas of Palestinian custodianship and the specificity of Israeli and Palestinian territorial borders.|$|R

5|$|The Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies (often simply {{referred}} to as the BYU Jerusalem Center, BYU–Jerusalem or Mormon University), situated on Mount of Olives in East <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>is</b> a satellite campus of Brigham Young University (BYU), the largest religious university in the United States. Owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, BYU-Idaho, or BYU-Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>is</b> regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E
