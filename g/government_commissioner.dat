5|$|In {{the period}} without a sitting council from 1905 to 1921, the {{government}} of the Territories was small but still active. A small civil service force was sent to Fort Smith to set the town up as the new administrative capital in 1911. A budget to provide minimal services was still given by the federal <b>government.</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Frederick D. White administered the territories day-to-day operations during that period. During this 16-year lapse in legislative government, no new laws were created, and the Territories and its population were severely neglected even with the services provided at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him <b>government</b> <b>commissioner</b> in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, {{which had}} been garrisoned at Debrecen. He {{replaced}} General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist Arrow Cross Party. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a Red Army attack across the Carpathian mountains. On 15 October 1944, Farkas was named commander of the Pest bridgehead and <b>Government</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Evacuation. In early November 1944, the first Russian units appeared on the southeastern edge of Budapest. As an associate of Farkas, Bánáthy likely had advance notice of the Russian advance. He also knew he would likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy {{was able to get}} his wife Eva, one-year-old son Béla and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy's family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.|$|E

25|$|After Slovak {{students}} {{started moving}} to nearby Sobrance {{and the number}} of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the <b>government</b> <b>commissioner</b> of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became {{an important part of the}} school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army.|$|E

2500|$|In 1507 Portuguese sailors {{came to the}} {{uninhabited}} {{island and}} established a visiting base. Diogo Fernandes Pereira, a Portuguese navigator, was the first European known to land in Mauritius. He named the island [...] "Ilha do Cirne".

In 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island [...] "Mauritius" [...] after Prince Maurice van Nassau of the Dutch Republic, the ruler of his country. France, which already controlled neighbouring Île Bourbon (now Réunion), took control of Mauritius in 1715 and renamed it Isle de France. From 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the French Revolution when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French Government. A Penal Code was published in 1791 and adoped by the Colonial Assembly in 1793, while a separate civil code was promulgated on 3 September 1807.

2500|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Russian general Alexander Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zürich, the only other Coalition army, under Alexander Suvorov, was forced to retreat out of Switzerland though the alps in winter. The damage from fighting, Suvorov's retreat and other {{disasters}} (including a fire that destroyed much of Altdorf in 1799) caused a famine in Uri. [...] Although the <b>government</b> <b>commissioner,</b> Heinrich Zschokke, organized a relief effort to prevent starvation, it took years for Uri to repair the damage to the villages and towns. In October 1801, a new government came to power in the Helvetic Republic and in early November the Canton of Waldstätten was dissolved and Uri became a canton again. [...] The governor, Josef Anton von Beroldingen, attempted unsuccessfully to bring the Leventina valley back into Uri. [...] Half a year later, on 17 April 1802, the Unitarian party took power back in the Republic and revised the constitution once again. [...] In early June, Uri rejected the newest constitution {{while at the same time}} French troops withdrew from Switzerland. [...] Without the French army to suppress them, Uri and other rural populations successfully rebelled against the government in the Stecklikrieg. [...] In response to the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, Napoleon issued the Act of Mediation in 1803. [...] As part of the Act of Mediation, Uri regained its independence and all attempts towards religious or constitutional reform were resisted. After the invasion of the Sixth Coalition into Switzerland on 29 December 1813, the Act of Mediation lost its power. [...] While the neighbouring cantons of Schwyz and Nidwalden wanted to return to the organization of the Old Swiss Confederation, Uri was part of the Zürich-led party, which sought to reorganize the 19 cantons created by the Act. [...] Uri also attempted, unsuccessful, to reincorporate the Leventina valley, but was only able to receive the rights to one-half of the taxes on all trade over Monte Piottino into the Leventina. [...] On 5 May 1815 the Landsgemeinde approved the federal constitution. [...] Uri then mediated between the Tagsatzung and Nidwalden, which had refused to recognize the treaty.|$|E
