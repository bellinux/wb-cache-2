60|$|When Arsenick with Soap gives a Regulus, {{and with}} Mercury {{sublimate}} a volatile fusible Salt, like Butter of Antimony, doth not this shew that Arsenick, {{which is a}} Substance totally volatile, is compounded of fix'd and volatile Parts, strongly cohering by a mutual Attraction, so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so, when an equal weight of Spirit of Wine and Oil of Vitriol are digested together, and in Distillation yield two fragrant and volatile Spirits which will not mix with one another, and a fix'd black Earth remains behind; doth not this shew that Oil of Vitriol is composed of volatile and fix'd Parts strongly united by Attraction, so as to ascend together in form of a volatile, acid, fluid Salt, until the Spirit of Wine attracts and separates the volatile Parts from the fixed? And therefore, since Oil <b>of</b> <b>Sulphur</b> per Campanam is of the same Nature with Oil of Vitriol, may it not be inferred, that Sulphur is also a mixture of volatile and fix'd Parts so strongly cohering by Attraction, as to ascend together in Sublimation. By dissolving <b>Flowers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sulphur</b> in Oil <b>of</b> Turpentine, and distilling the Solution, {{it is found that}} <b>Sulphur</b> is composed <b>of</b> an inflamable thick Oil or fat Bitumen, an acid Salt, a very fix'd Earth, and a little Metal. The three first were found not much unequal to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth considering. The acid Salt dissolved in Water, is the same with Oil <b>of</b> <b>Sulphur</b> per Campanam, and abounding much in the Bowels of the Earth, and particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other Ingredients of the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper, and Earth, and with them compounds Allum, Vitriol, and Sulphur. With the Earth alone it compounds Allum; with the Metal alone, or Metal and Earth together, it compounds Vitriol; and with the Bitumen and Earth it compounds Sulphur. Whence it comes to pass that Markasites abound with those three Minerals. And is it not from the mutual Attraction of the Ingredients that they stick together for compounding these Minerals, and that the Bitumen carries up the other Ingredients <b>of</b> the <b>Sulphur,</b> which without it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put concerning all, or almost all the gross Bodies in Nature.

40|$|On {{comparing}} the weight increases {{of the two}} groups of sheep it will be noticed that the mean increases are reasonably equal there being only a difference of 0. 11 kg. in favour <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> fed group which is altogether insignificant. When allowance is made for the difference in food intake it is found that this adjustment does not make an appreciable reduction in the variance and that the adjusted difference of 2. 2 kg. in favour of the control group remains quite insignificant. In short, it may be said that the conclusion is justified that a daily dose of 5 grms. <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> is without effect on the bodyweight, food consumption and wool production of sheep. It seems necessary, however, to review briefly the work on sulphur feeding to sheep that has been published from this Institute in order to state the final conclusions clearly. Steyn's investigations (1931, 1932, 1934 and 1935) were undertaken, as stated by him, to determine the quantity <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> that could be administered to young and full-grown sheep with safety over prolonged periods. Obviously, the body weights of the sheep could be registered with advantage and this was done accordingly. Furthermore, the sheep had to be shorn {{in the course of the}} experiment, and hence, the weights of the wool produced were recorded. It is abundantly clear from Steyn's publication (1934) that he fully realizes the unsuitability of his material to determine the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> when, naturally, increase in body weight, food consumption, effect on production, etc., are important considerations and if this information had been required his experiments would have been planned differently so as to ensure the registration of these observations for the collection of suitable data for justifiable and definite conclusions. At best, therefore, it can be said that the results of Steyn's original experiment (1931, 1932) seemed to suggest that sulphur when administered to mature sheep at. the rate of 5 grms. once, twice or three times weekly, over prolonged periods stimulates increase in body weight and wool yield. In a subsequent experiment (Steyn 1935) 5 grms. <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> were administered daily to immature sheep without detrimental effect on body weight and on the wool production of the animals. As a matter of fact the differences in body weight and in the weights of the wool produced are significantly in favour <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> fed animals. All the sheep were fed ad lib. as one group, which excludes a consideration of more efficient food utilization or increased food consumption <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> fed when compared with the controls. Again, therefore, it can be said that this investigation suggested that sulphur feeding to sheep affects their body weights and wool production beneficially. What is, however, quite definite about this work is that sulphur administered in the doses stated did not affect the animals detrimentally. Working upon the indications of Steyn's original experiments (1931, 1932) du Toit et al (1935) carried out an investigation with sheep to determine the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Five grms. <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> were dosed to each animal in a group of sheep daily while another group was kept as controls. The experiment was planned to satisfy the requirements of a feeding trial. The body weights of the sheep were registered periodically, a productive ration was fed to the individual sheep in separate feeding boxes and the food consumption of the individual animals was recorded. The animals were kept on the basal ration for twelve months pre-experimental period after which the sulphur was administered to the one group for a further twelve months. Both groups were of course still kept on the basal ration for the second period of twelve months. Wool was collected from all the animals in both groups, analysed and reported on by van Wyk, Botha and Bekker (1935). In view of the entire absence of any significant difference in body weight, food consumption and wool production <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> fed group when compared with the control group the conclusion appears to be justified that a daily dose <b>of</b> 5 grms. <b>sulphur</b> did not affect the sheep significantly, when they were given a production ration. The above experiment with sheep on a limited food intake obviously excludes a consideration of increased food consumption which might be an effect <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> feeding and hence the investigation reported on in the present paper under conditions of ad libitum feeding was undertaken. Again the experiment was planned, primarily with the object of determining the nutritional value <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and fulfils the demands of a feeding trial. As in the previous work no beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> feeding could be determined, nor was the food intake <b>of</b> the <b>sulphur</b> fed group significantly affected. The main result of the Onderstepoort experiments on the effect <b>of</b> administering <b>sulphur</b> to sheep, could therefore be summarized as follows: Five grms. <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> will be given per os to sheep over prolonged periods without detrimental effects. The body weight, food consumption and wool production are apparently not significantly affected by the sulphur administered to the sheep.

40|$|Losses of bees by {{poisoning}} {{have been}} greatly increased {{in recent years}} by the growing practice of applying insecticidal and fungicidal sprays to fruit trees. Preliminary laboratory tests showed that, of the common constituents of spray mixtures, only lead arsenate and <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> were likely to cause serious honeybee poisoning, though Derris emulsion may cause slight poisoning. Syrup containing lime sulphur, nicotine sulphate, or copper sulphate was strongly repellent to the bees. It seemed possible that spray mixtures might be made repellent to the honeybee by the addition of suitable substances. Further trials showed that lead arsenate solution, at least in the concentrations normally used, was no more attractive to the bee than distilled water. Concentrations of 1 / 500 lime sulphur or 1 / 2000 nicotine sulphate were sufficient to reduce the uptake of M/ 1 sucrose to less than 10 % of that of unadulterated sucrose solution, and very much lower concentrations appreciably affected the uptake. The presence of lead arsenate in these solutions seemed to make them even more repellent. The repellent effect was reduced, though not entirely destroyed, when the solutions were evaporated to dryness and taken up in distilled water again. Creosote (0. 13 %), which has been suggested as a possible repellent, gave erratic results under laboratory conditions, and, in view of the danger of phytocidal action it is probably unwise to attempt to use its repellent property. Open <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> apple trees were sprayed with various spray mixtures in an orchard experiment, and counts of bees showed both lime sulphur (1 %) and nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) to have retained their repellent value for at least 7 days, in spite of heavy rain. If bees can thus be deterred from visiting the open blossom, {{it should be possible to}} deter them even more thoroughly from collection of water contaminated by sprays applied at the correct time. Data collected throughout the country during the last 3 years show calcium or lead arsenate to be the constituent of orchard sprays causing honeybee poisoning. Bees may collect arsenic when visiting fruit trees, or plants growing beneath or near the trees, for pollen or water, contaminated water apparently being the chief cause of poisoning; about 0. 00005 mg. internal arsenic per bee has been found to be a lethal dose. When arsenical sprays alone are applied to trees, particularly if to the open blossom as is sometimes the case with gooseberries and cherries, severe poisoning from the pollen may be expected. On the other hand, much of the danger from contaminated water should be removed by the incorporation <b>of</b> lime <b>sulphur</b> (1 % or more) or nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) into sprays intended for application either before flowering or after petal fall, provided that alternative sources of water are available for foraging bees. Provision of water within the hive is suggested as a further safeguard...|$|R

Sulphur is an important macroelement in plant nutrition and it is part of important amino acids, vitamins and proteins. Sulphur content in crops predetermines the quantity and quality <b>of</b> harvested products. <b>Sulphur</b> in our latitudes entered in soil particularly due to atmospheric depositions. With desulphurization of power plants, there has been a significant decline in sulphur entering soil in recent decades, from an approximate figure of 120 kg <b>of</b> pure <b>sulphur</b> per hectare in 1990 to mere 6 8 kg <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> per hectare in 2013. Due to small intake <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in soil, plants that draw off large amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> and {{due to the fact that}} sulphur is swiftly washed off from the topsoil to deeper soil layers where it is inaccessible to the crops, there is often lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in the nourishment of crops being grown, which regards both sulphur demanding crops, such as oil crops, and crops such as cereals where lack <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> has not manifested itself as much so far. Soil contains sulphur in an inorganic and organic form. Inorganic sulphur in agricultural land is represented to a lesser extent than organic sulphur, but it is the main source <b>of</b> plant available <b>sulphur</b> and it is a highlydynamic soil component.

Australian coals have attained a dominant {{position in the world}} market by being able to provide low sulphur coals. To maintain this position it is necessary to maximise sulphur removal from mine product to meet the increasing demand for sulphur free coal throughout the world. Observations of modes and levels <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> occurrence in coals and coal bearing strata along a geotraverse in the North Bowen Basin of Queensland indicate that the modes <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> are sufficiently distinct to indicate plant material as the principle source <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in these coals, and to indicate sedimentary/climatic factors as plajang {{an important role in the}} percentage level and modes <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> present. The sulphur inherent within the surrounding strata of these coal seams does not have a direct and significant effect on the percentage level or modes <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> within the coal seams...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Results of the {{experiment}} conducted in sandy loam soils during 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 revealed that quality parameters of cane juice and jaggery were positively and significantly influenced by the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> irrespective <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 100 kg/ha had significantly influenced the quality of juice but it was comparable with the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 80 kg/ha which was reflected in quality of jaggery. There is an increase of 1. 27 units in juice sucrose was observed with the application <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> at 80 kg/ha. But sources did not differ markedly on juice quality and jaggery quality parameters. As Gypsum is cheapest source compared to Elemental sulphur, {{it can be concluded}} that maximum returns can be obtained at 80 kg S/ha through Gypsum application.

30|$|If the {{temperature}} reaches 425  °C, RDPS and TSC (Fig.  2) {{as well as}} H 2 S in desulphurization gases rise (Table 2). Removal degrees <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> characterize with the ratio between reaction rates <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> conversion and COM. The greater is the ratio, the less is the sulphur content in obtained coal and appropriately the sulphur removal degree is the higher. That is why {{we can state that}} if temperature exceeds 425 – 450  °C, the conversion rates <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds and COM become equal.|$|R

40|$|Most <b>of</b> {{exogenous}} epigenetic <b>sulphur</b> deposits {{are clearly}} associated with intensely karstified carbonate and sulphate rocks. This paper demonstrates, using the Pre-Carpathian region as an example, that karstification {{is one of}} the most important processes guiding the formation <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits. This is determined by a coincidence of some major prerequisites of these two processes. In the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions the Miocene aquifer system is well drained by erosion valleys; the giant network caves known here in gypsum formed under past artesian conditions. In the region <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits, associated with the same karstified gypsum strata, true artesian conditions still prevail. Hydrogeologic data show that abundant cavities detected in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits can be interpreted as having the same origin as the relict caves of the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions. The widespread belief that the gypsum/anhydrite bed in the region is an aquifuge separating the Miocene aquifers is inadequate. This belief caused much controversy with regard to the genetic interpretations <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits in the region. Cave systems formed by the upward water flow through the gypsum/anhydrite bed govern the water exchange between the aquifers within the aquifer system. A new karst model for the formation <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> deposits is suggested. It agrees well with the hydrogeological features of the Miocene sequence and with biogeochemical mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> origin in low-temperature diagenetic environments...|$|R
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Annuals, ephemeral growth (“opslag”) or perennials. Often {{cultivated}} in gardens. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Typical daisy flower, ray florets on the outside. Often scalloped leaf. Sticky, sometimes aromatic. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Cyanogenic glycosides • LD HCN + 2 mg/kg in all species • Monogastric animals less affected by plants with cyanogenic glycosides because HCl destroys hydrolysing enzymes • Plants {{with more than}} 20 mg % (200 ppm) HCN, potentially dangerous. ABSORPTION AND DISPOSITION: • CN¯ rapidly absorbed from g. i. t. and by inhalation (HCN gas) • Rapidly and very effectively detoxified in body by sulphur transferase (rhodanese) enzymes which bind it to sulphur from sulphane pool forming thiocyanate (which is excreted through urine). • Possible to ingest just less than LD continuously over extended periods without harm. • If rate of liberation from glycosides in plants exceeds speed of detoxification, problems occur. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • In excess situation CN¯ binds stably with Fe³+ in tissue cytochrome oxidase system and inhibits this. Thus electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation is stopped and chain of cellular respiration is halted. • Results in histotoxic anoxia or hypoxia. • Normal oxygenation of blood not interfered with. • Blood stays red. (When treating, jugular blood much redder than normal.) • CNS depression sets in (oxygen requirement of CNS high) • Terminally respiratory depression sets in and available oxygen is utilised by uninhibited cytochrome oxidase leading to cyanosis. SYNDROMES: Prussic acid poisoning, geilsiekte. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic system. CLINICAL SIGNS: In practice a problem in cattle, sheep and goats. Peracute: • Death in few minutes - usually found dead. • Transient convulsions progressing to paralysis, stupor. Acute: (usually) • Respiratory distress - dyspnoea (gasping), polypnoea, cyanosis. • CNS excitement and tremor - convulsions, paralysis and stupor. • G. I. T. : Bloat, frothing at mouth and salivation may occur. NECROPSY: • Cyanosis - (in peracute poisoning e. g. execution in man, may have bright red blood). • Congestion of blood vessels (blood unclotted or clots slowly). • Asphyxiation signs: haemorrhages in trachea, bronchi and lungs. • Subepi- and -endocardial haemorrhages frequent. • Smell of bitter almonds (only some individuals can smell it) • Rumen: Leaves and other plant residues. DIAGNOSIS: • HCN rapidly degraded and dissipates easily. • Specimens to be taken soon after death. • Degradation rapid in liver and rumen. • Much slower in muscle, although HCN concentration in muscle is much lower. With long interim this is the specimen/organ of choice. Still positive next day. 1. PM {{as soon as possible}} 2. Keep specimen refrigerated or frozen: • Ruminal content • Liver • Muscle • Plant material. TREATMENT: Two steps: 1. Remove the cyanide from the cytochrome oxidase and fix this lethal CN¯ in harmless, inert form. CN has greater affinity for tissue cytochrome oxidase Fe 3 + than methaemoglobin, but can be removed from cytochrome system by large methaemoglobin concentrations. Therefore increase methaemoglobin concentration carefully and under controlled conditions with NaNO 2 solution intravenously. 2. Then assist in removal of CN¯ via urine as thiocyanate. Assist sulphur transferases to inactivate cyanide by supplying <b>sulphur</b> in form <b>of</b> sodium thiosulphate (“hypo”). PREVENTION AND AVOIDANCE: Supply extra sulphur • 5 - 7 % <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulphur</b> in lick • Hypo in drinking water Avoid or limit grazing of plants during danger periods - avoid wilted, frosted and hail-damaged material.
