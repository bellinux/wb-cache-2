This approach is shown in Fig.  1 a. As the gas rate and the bottom hole <b>flowing</b> <b>pressure</b> values are stabilized, this method can provide the value of productivity accurately. Having a low-permeability gas reservoir, given that the gas flow rate increases in each working system, it requires a long time for stabilization and vents a large amount of gases, which is detrimental for the environment.

Finally, the well will be shut to recover the pressure to the initial formation pressure. Using this approach, the <b>flowing</b> <b>pressure</b> {{does not need to}} reach the stabilization, but the frequent shut-in (build-up) periods among production intervals to recover the pressure to the initial reservoir pressure is the main disadvantage of this method.

Before the final shut-in that allows pressure recovering back to the initial formation pressure, a prolonged production period was to make both production and <b>flowing</b> <b>pressure</b> reach stability so that the obtained productivity would demonstrate formation characteristics accurately.
