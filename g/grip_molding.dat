50|$|As {{a driver}} may have {{his hands on}} the {{steering}} wheel {{for hours at a time}} these are designed with ergonomics in mind. However, the most important concern is that the driver can effectively convey torque to the steering system; this is especially important in vehicles without power steering or in the rare event of a loss of steering assist. A typical design for circular steering wheels is a steel or magnesium rim with a plastic or rubberized <b>grip</b> <b>molded</b> over and around it. Some drivers purchase vinyl or textile steering wheel covers to enhance grip or comfort, or simply as decoration. Another device used to make steering easier is the brodie knob.|$|R
5000|$|The M86 {{sniper rifle}} is a bolt action sniper rifle {{manufactured}} by Harris Gunworks (formerly Harris-McMillan Gunworks, formerly G. McMillan & Co.). It {{was used by}} the U.S. armed forces, primarily Navy SEALs and Delta Force. It was most commonly built in 7.62×51mm NATO chambering with an internal 5-round magazine, or optionally configured to use either 5- or 10-round M14 detachable box magazines. It was also built with a magnum action, accommodating calibers such as [...]300 Winchester Magnum and [...]338 Lapua Magnum. The magnum action version was available only with an internal 5-round magazine. Harris also produced the M89, with essentially the same build standard as the M86, but which utilized a rifle stock with an enhanced <b>grip</b> <b>mold.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The M7 1095 {{carbon steel}} blade is 6 3/4 inches long, {{with an overall}} length of 11.9 inches. Blade width is 7/8 inch and it weighs about 9.6 ounces. One edge is {{sharpened}} its full length while to {{opposite side of the}} blade has approximately 3 inches sharpened. There are no markings on the blade itself. The manufacturer's initials or name along with [...] "US M7" [...] will be found stamped under the crossguard (see photo, right). The non-slip <b>grips</b> are <b>molded</b> black plastic. The steel parts have a uniform dark grey/black parkerized finish.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Renthal {{introduced}} {{new products}} for the road racing market such as adjustable clip on handlebars and Kevlar-infused dual compound road race grips. The road race Kevlar <b>grips</b> use a <b>mold</b> from the MX grips in that they have open ends for bar end weights and a smaller inner flange.|$|R
40|$|DE 102007048385 B 3 UPAB: 20090220 NOVELTY - Production of {{components}} (6) using generative processes, especially fused deposition modeling, comprises forming a grid (7) around the component. This allows the component to be manipulated by gripping the grid, without {{direct contact with}} the component itself. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a similar method in which a pair of <b>gripping</b> jaws are <b>molded</b> around the components which can be brought into contact with it using a manipulating unit. USE - Production {{of components}} using generative processes, especially fused deposition modeling. ADVANTAGE - Damage to the component during manipulation and post-treatment is avoided...|$|R
50|$|Around 1993, an {{engineer}} and computer aided design (CAD) guru named Sandy Strayer joined Tripp Research, Inc. Tripp and Strayer revolutionized the 1911 market by designing a modular hi-capacity 1911 frame for IPSC shooters. While Para Ordnance already had a hi-capacity 1911 frame on the market, {{it was made of}} steel. The modular frame made use of a fiber-reinforced plastic which combined the trigger guard, grip, and integral magazine well. It used a proprietary grip which attached to the upper portion of the frame (a metal part that comprised the dust cover and frame rails). The result was that the modular frame weighed less than half of what the steel frame weighed. Further, while the Para frame feels notably larger than a standard 1911 in the hand, the STI feels similar to a regular 1911 since the <b>grips</b> are <b>molded</b> into the plastic of the frame rather than screwed to the outside. Tripp and Strayer were listed as the co-patent holders on the modular frame. Soon after the modular frame was introduced, the company name changed to STI (Strayer-Tripp, Inc.) and Strayer was given an equity stake in the new company.|$|R
50|$|Ergonomics were a key {{focus in}} the design of the firearm, and as a result, three {{interchangeable}} grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearmThe injection <b>molded</b> <b>grip</b> frame contains 4 steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard. The polymer grip has a non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. Under the dust cover the grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer.|$|R
50|$|Ergonomics {{and fully}} ambidextrous {{controls}} were a key {{focus in the}} design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. The injection <b>molded</b> <b>grip</b> frame contains four steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and textured. The polymer grip has a texturized 'HI-GRIP' non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear backstraps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. The hollow cross pin that secures the lower end of the backstrap was designed to function as a loophole for attachment of a lanyard. Under the dust cover the grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer.|$|R
5000|$|Pressured {{by dozens}} of imitations and the {{proliferation}} of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the Model 1908 Vest Pocket pistol. The basic Vest Pocket pistol design was used {{as a starting point for}} the new design. Dieudonné Saive (who would later design the Browning Hi-Power pistol and FN FAL rifle) was asked during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol. His design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the M1908 version. For example, the hand palm activated grip safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the receiver was extended under the grip so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever - rather than pushing it down into the receiver- without having to release one's grip on the pistol. This improvement was at the cost of the slide hold-back feature that was eliminated in the new design. The receiver has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol. The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced a magazine safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol. Parts are not interchangeable between these pistols. [...] A cocking indicator was also incorporated on the back of the slide. This model was marketed under the name [...] "Baby" [...] - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic <b>grips</b> were <b>molded</b> with both the initials [...] "FN" [...] at the top of the grip in a circle and the word [...] "BABY" [...] at the bottom of the grip under a raised crescent. This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the [...] "Baby Browning" [...] pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated polymer grips.|$|R
