5|$|The {{alliance}} {{plans to}} allow tickets to be booked <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Europe {{to the other}} on a single website. In June 2009 London and Continental Railways, and the Eurostar UK operations they held ownership of, became fully nationalised by the UK government.|$|E
5|$|At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield {{to ask the}} resort's {{reception}} desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's Dispatches that, <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons {{that they can use}} as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! Hi! What's {{the meaning}} o' this?" [...] cried a voice <b>from</b> around <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the big barn, and a man, dressed in {{overalls}} {{and a heavy}} cap and carrying a broom, appeared.|$|R
40|$|The P. falciparum pPFrep 20 {{repetitive}} element from the Palo Alto Uganda strain has been isolated and sequenced. The Palo Alto pPFrep 20 repeat (pPFPArep 20) has a clustered subtelomeric location and on chromosome 1 has been deleted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> chromosome 1 from 5 other strains {{has revealed that}} pPFrep 20 sequences have been deleted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> in 3 <b>of</b> them. Thus, deletion of pPFrep 20 {{appears to be a}} frequent event that could significantly contribute to chromosome size polymorphism in P. falciparum...|$|R

[...] {{repeated}} the Duke {{in a deep}} and low tone, which nevertheless was heard <b>from</b> the <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the hall {{in which they were}} assembled to the other, [...] "thou hast been imposed upon, Crevecoeur, by some wild report--it is impossible!" ...|$|R
5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route {{to ensure that there}} would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
25|$|The trains stop {{at every}} station and all trains run {{directly}} <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the line to}} the other.|$|E

60|$|Musing {{on matters}} far {{different}} from the fall of waters, the gleam of moonlight, or {{the song of the}} nightingale, the stately Leicester walked slowly <b>from</b> the <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the terrace to the other, his cloak wrapped around him, and his sword under his arm, without seeing anything resembling the human form.|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} the twist in a birefringent optical fiber <b>from</b> measurements, at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the fiber, of the fiber {{response to an}} impulsive source at the same end. This is the inverse problem of determining a non-constant coefficient, of a first order hyperbolic system in one space dimension with two speeds of propagation, <b>from</b> measurements at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an interval, of the solution of this system corresponding to an impulsive source at the same end. We prove a stability result for this inverse problem and give a provable reconstruction algorithm for this inverse problem...|$|R

25|$|If the dipole is not driven at the center, {{then the}} feed point {{resistance}} will be higher. If the feed point is distance x <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a half wave (λ/2) dipole, the radiation resistance {{relative to the}} feedpoint will be given by the following equation.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, the line connects central Singapore to {{northern}} and southern parts of the island. It runs mostly on overhead viaducts but goes underground within the Central Area, between Bishan and Marina South Pier. Travelling <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the line to the other takes about an hour.|$|E

60|$|For {{it was in}} {{this very}} city of Bristol, twenty-seven years ago, that I {{received}} my first lesson in what is now called Social Science; and yet, alas! more than ten years elapsed ere I could even spell out that lesson, though it had been written for me (as well as for all England) in letters <b>of</b> flame, <b>from</b> the <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> heaven to the other.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} article, a new {{methodology}} is proposed for impregnation of wood. In this methodology, depressurizing <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> grain <b>of</b> the log, and pressurizing on impregnation solution around the log {{and on the}} other <b>end</b> grain <b>of</b> the log are done at the same time. An impregnation apparatus was manufactured on the basis of new methodology for impregnation of wood. Using this new impregnation apparatus, impregnation experiments were carried out on the maple log. The impregnation experiments showed good results...|$|R
25|$|In a pennate muscle, as a {{consequence}} of their arrangement, fibers are shorter than they would be if they ran <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the muscle to the other. This implies that each fiber is composed of a smaller number N of sarcomeres in series. Moreover, the larger is the pennation angle, the shorter are the fibers.|$|E
25|$|Haiti has {{two main}} {{highways}} that run <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the country to}} the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve.|$|E
25|$|Stellating {{a regular}} polygon symmetrically creates a regular star polygon or {{polygonal}} compound. These polygons are characterised {{by the number}} of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure. Like all regular polygons, their vertices lie on a circle. m also corresponds to the number of vertices around the circle to get <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a given edge to the other, starting at 1.|$|E
50|$|Sirach {{mentions}} riddles as {{a popular}} dinner pastime, and the Talmud contains several, such as this <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Kinnim: 'What animal has one voice living and seven voices dead?'

5000|$|The {{primary goal}} of Tak {{is to build a}} road <b>from</b> <b>one</b> {{opposite}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the board to the other. Only flat stones and capstones can contribute to a road, while standing stones do not. As soon as the road is built, the player who built it wins. This is called a [...] "road win". Roads {{do not have to be}} in a straight line, but stones can only connect when they are adjacent to one another. Stones cannot connect diagonally.|$|R
50|$|Another type has cables (or {{a single}} cable) {{extending}} <b>from</b> both (or <b>one)</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder. The cables are jacketed in plastic (nylon, in those referred to), {{which provides a}} smooth surface that permits sealing the cables where they pass through the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder. Of course, a single cable {{has to be kept}} in tension.|$|R
25|$|Many of the Ainu dialects, even <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Hokkaido to the other, {{were not}} {{mutually}} intelligible; however, the classic Ainu {{language of the}} Yukar, or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar {{and other forms of}} narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Victor Prus, {{the station}} is a normal side {{platform}} station, built by cut-and-cover {{in order to provide}} a large space for the heavily trafficked mezzanine. As {{a key part of the}} underground city, the mezzanine has ticket barriers on either side, in order to allow pedestrians to pass <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station to the other. Bridges over the tracks below the mezzanine level allow passengers to cross from one platform to the other.|$|E
25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the main cable during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E

A great and a wonderful land! But here, when I put in, is as though I were in my own Bhotiyal.' ...|$|R
50|$|Belgrade has a {{population}} of over 1.5 million people, making it largest city by population without subway in Europe. Traffic congestion is common and poor infrastructure has put additional strain on the city, while the existing public transport system is incapable of shuttling passengers <b>from</b> <b>one</b> outlying <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the city to another efficiently. At the same time, the suburban railway system Beovoz cannot meet its expected role, due to inadequate infrastructure, and obsolete rolling stock. The construction of a metro is meant to alleviate these problems in the near future.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, Evel Knievel {{used the}} entire {{distance}} of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars at the stadium. Knievel launched his motorcycle <b>from</b> atop <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Coliseum, jumping the cars {{in the center of}} the field, and stopping high atop the other end. The jump was filmed by ABC Wide World of Sports. Also in 1973, the Coliseum was host to Super Bowl VII which saw the AFC champion Miami Dolphins (17–0) defeat the NFC champion Washington Redskins (13–4), 14–7, and become the first, and presently the only, team in the NFL to complete a perfect, undefeated season and postseason.|$|R
25|$|Mérida {{has four}} large {{internal}} roadways, which run <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the city to}} the other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andrés Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than , it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of Mérida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Américas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Próceres avenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not {{think of it as}} a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|Minehead {{signal box}} was closed on 27 March 1966 {{after which the}} two tracks between there and Dunster were {{operated}} as two bi-directional single lines, one to each platform. Dunster Signal Box was retained to control the level crossing and points there, and ground frames allowed the train crew to change the points at Minehead to allow locomotives to run round <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the train to the other. The original turntable was removed from Minehead in 1967 by which time all trains were operated by diesels.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{morphology}} of Thermoplasma volcanium isolates take {{on different}} shapes {{depending on their}} placement within the growth curve. During early logarithmic growth, the isolates take on forms of all shapes including, but not limited to, coccoid-, disc-, and club-shaped of around 0.2-0.5 micrometers. During stationary and late logarithmic growth phases, the isolates primarily take on a spherical (coccoid) shape and can produce buds around 0.3 micrometers in width that are thought to contain DNA. A single flagella is present on the organism, emerging <b>from</b> <b>one</b> polar <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the cell. The Thermoplasma volcanium isolates have no cell envelope or cell wall.|$|R
60|$|She {{was about}} to follow, when {{it seemed to her}} as if some one was moving in the {{darkness}} close beside her.

50|$|In summer 2008, Shook Ones {{released}} a split EP with <b>End</b> <b>of</b> a Year, a band which had also left Revelation Records the previous fall. Philadelphia-based Runner Up Records handled {{the release of}} the split, which has four songs <b>from</b> Shook <b>Ones</b> and <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> a Year. The band's latest LP, The Unquoteable A.M.H., was released on Paper + Plastick.|$|R
