50|$|Demand draft (DD) fraud {{typically}} involves {{one or more}} corrupt bank employees. Firstly, such employees {{remove a}} few DD leaves or DD books from stock and write them like a regular DD. Since they are insiders, they know the coding and punching of a demand draft. Such fraudulent demand drafts are usually drawn payable at a distant city without <b>debiting</b> <b>an</b> <b>account.</b> The draft is cashed at the payable branch. The fraud is discovered only when the bank's head office does the branch-wise reconciliation, which normally take six months, by which time the money is gone.|$|R
50|$|Merchant error - A {{merchant}} may improperly <b>debit</b> <b>a</b> customer's <b>account</b> due {{to human}} error. For example, a customer may authorize a $5.00 purchase which may post to the account for $500.00. The customer has {{the option to}} recover these funds through chargeback to the merchant.|$|R
25|$|Bank {{statements}} are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting {{standards of the}} world. Under GAAP {{there are two kinds}} of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits <b>a</b> credit <b>account</b> to increase its balance, and <b>debits</b> <b>a</b> credit <b>account</b> to decrease its balance.|$|R
5000|$|An {{accounting}} {{model is}} {{one based on}} the premise that for every credit there is <b>a</b> <b>debit.</b> More symbolically, <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> model expresses some principle of conservation in the form ...|$|R
50|$|When {{recording}} {{numbers in}} <b>accounting,</b> <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> value {{is placed on}} the left side of a ledger for <b>a</b> <b>debited</b> <b>account</b> and <b>a</b> credit value {{is placed on the}} right side of a ledger for <b>a</b> credited <b>account.</b> <b>A</b> <b>debit</b> or <b>a</b> credit either increases or decreases the total balance in each account, depending on what kind of accounts they are.|$|R

50|$|Visa Buxx is a prepaid card {{available}} in the United States and intended for use by teenagers. The program was Visa's first prepaid card product and was launched in 2001. Visa Buxx is not a credit card; instead, it <b>debits</b> <b>a</b> prepaid <b>account,</b> which enables parents to load the card's account online or over the phone and monitor spending, so parents can work with their teen to review their spending habits and avoid unexpected debt and interest charges. The face of a current Buxx card identifies it as <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> card.|$|R
25|$|Debit {{cards and}} credit cards are {{creative}} terms used by the banking industry to market and identify each card. From the cardholder's point of view, <b>a</b> credit card <b>account</b> normally contains <b>a</b> credit balance, <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> card <b>account</b> normally contains <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> balance. <b>A</b> <b>debit</b> card is {{used to make a}} purchase with one's own money. A credit card is used to make a purchase by borrowing money.|$|R
50|$|Each {{transaction}} {{that takes}} place within the business will consist {{of at least one}} <b>debit</b> to <b>a</b> specific <b>account</b> and at least one credit to another specific <b>account.</b> <b>A</b> <b>debit</b> to one <b>account</b> can be balanced by more than one credit to other accounts, and vice versa. For all transactions, the total debits must be equal to the total credits and therefore balance.|$|R
50|$|Prepaid payment {{instruments}} are methods that facilitate {{purchase of goods}} and services against the value stored on such instruments. The value stored on such instruments represents the value paid for by the holder, by cash, by <b>debit</b> to <b>a</b> bank <b>account,</b> or by credit card.|$|R
50|$|In double-entry bookkeeping, {{expenses}} are recorded as <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> to <b>an</b> expense <b>account</b> (<b>an</b> income statement <b>account)</b> and <b>a</b> credit to either <b>an</b> asset <b>account</b> or <b>a</b> liability <b>account,</b> which are balance sheet accounts. An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The {{purchase of a}} capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] in {{the debit}} column denotes the {{increasing}} {{effect of a}} transaction on the asset account balance (total debits less total credits), because <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> to <b>an</b> asset <b>account</b> is <b>an</b> increase. The asset account above {{has been added to}} by <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> value X, i.e. the balance has increased by £X or $X. Likewise, in the liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total <b>debits),</b> because <b>a</b> credit to <b>a</b> liability <b>account</b> is <b>an</b> increase.|$|R
50|$|As {{the number}} of ATM units increase, the {{machines}} are prone to hacker attacks, fraud, robberies and security breaches. In the past, the ATM machines' main purpose was to deliver cash {{in the form of}} bank notes and to <b>debit</b> <b>a</b> corresponding bank <b>account.</b> However, ATM machines are becoming more complicated, and they serve numerous functions, thus becoming a high priority target to robbers and hackers.|$|R

50|$|European online {{direct debit}} {{solutions}} are particularly {{popular due to}} the lower use of credit cards in Europe as compared to other countries like the United States. Transactions can be approved in real-time and funds in 1 to 3 business days. Chargebacks remain a risk inherently when <b>debiting</b> <b>a</b> consumer’s bank <b>account,</b> however, using additional verification systems reduces the risk significantly and many payment processors maintain an extensive fraud database that mitigates the risks.|$|R
50|$|In Portugal {{a certain}} number of roads are {{designated}} Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being BRISA. For cash-free payments there exists the Via Verde, an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically <b>debited</b> from <b>a</b> bank <b>account.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a credit}} card or <b>debit</b> card <b>account,</b> <b>a</b> dispute is a {{situation}} in which a customer questions the validity of a transaction that was registered to the account. Customers dispute charges for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized charges, excessive charges, failure by the merchant to deliver merchandise, defective merchandise, dissatisfaction with the product(s) or service(s) received, or billing errors.|$|R
5000|$|Southern Airways {{accounted}} for the $2 million by <b>debiting</b> it to <b>an</b> <b>account</b> entitled [...] "Hijacking Payment." [...] This account was reported {{as a type of}} receivable under [...] "other assets" [...] on Southern's balance sheet. The company maintained that {{they would be able to}} collect the cash from the Cuban government and that, therefore, a receivable existed. Southern Airways was repaid $2 million by the Cuban government, which was attempting to improve relations with the United States.|$|R
50|$|The tariff is {{calculated}} in UTT (Unidade Tarifária de Telecomunicações - Telecommunication Tariff Units), a common tariff unit used by all telecommunication companies in Angola. The {{price of one}} UTT was 10 Kwanzas in 2016. Recharging cards are available with 125 UTT, 375 UTT, 625 UTT and 1250 UTT for 900 Kwanzas respectively 2700 Kwanzas etc. Post-paid contracts can also be paid by bank transfer or direct <b>debit</b> from <b>a</b> bank <b>account.</b> The Unitel phone numbers begin with 92, 93 and 94.|$|R
50|$|By {{transferring}} {{the ownership of}} deposits from one party to another, banks can avoid using physical cash {{as a method of}} payment. Commercial bank deposits account for most of the money supply in use today. For example, if a bank in the United States makes a loan to a customer by depositing the loan proceeds in that customer's checking account, the bank typically records this event by <b>debiting</b> <b>an</b> asset <b>account</b> on the bank's books (called loans receivable or some similar name) and credits the deposit liability or checking account of the customer on the bank's books. From an economic standpoint, the bank has essentially created economic money (although not legal tender). The customer's checking account balance has no dollar bills in it, as <b>a</b> demand deposit <b>account</b> is simply <b>a</b> liability owed by the bank to its customer. In this way, commercial banks are allowed to increase the money supply (without printing currency, or legal tender).|$|R
50|$|The {{option to}} be {{assigned}} temporary plates allows owners a financial saving in the case they have vehicles (e.g. motorcycles) which they intend to drive only during one particular part of the year. While temporary plates can only {{be used for the}} time printed on them and new ones have {{to be assigned}} and bought if the vehicle is supposed to be on public roads later on {{there is no need to}} renew regular plates periodically. German motor vehicle tax is paid independently of the license plates by annual direct <b>debit</b> from <b>a</b> bank <b>account.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the Confessions d'un revolutionnaire Proudhon further {{explained}} {{his use of}} this phrase: [...] In my first memorandum, in a frontal assault upon the established order, I said things like, Property is theft! The intention was to lodge a protest, to highlight, so to speak, the inanity of our institutions. At the time, that was my sole concern. Also, in the memorandum in which I demonstrated that startling proposition using simple arithmetic, I took care {{to speak out against}} any communist conclusion.In the System of Economic Contradictions, having recalled and confirmed my initial formula, I added another quite contrary one rooted in considerations of quite another order—a formula that could neither destroy the first proposition nor be demolished by it: Property is freedom. ... In respect of property, as of all economic factors, harm and abuse cannot be dissevered from the good, any more than debit can from asset in double-entry book-keeping. The one necessarily spawns the other. To seek {{to do away with the}} abuses of property, is to destroy the thing itself; just as the striking of <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> from <b>an</b> <b>account</b> is tantamount to striking it from the credit record.|$|R
50|$|Different methods {{exist in}} {{accounting}} for recording {{the purchase of}} a product bought at the invoice price. One method, the gross method, involves simply recording the full amount of the invoice as <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> to <b>accounts</b> payable and <b>a</b> corresponding credit to cash. If any discounts are given, they are itemized as a separate credit to cash, plus the purchase price. The net method, on the other hand, begins with the purchase price, including any discounts, which are then debited to purchases in the <b>accounting</b> ledger. <b>A</b> corresponding credit is then made to accounts payable.|$|R
50|$|A bank counts <b>a</b> nostro <b>account</b> with <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> {{balance as}} <b>a</b> cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, <b>a</b> vostro <b>account</b> with <b>a</b> credit balance (i.e. a deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> balance (<b>a</b> loan) is an asset. Thus in many banks a credit entry on <b>an</b> <b>account</b> ("CR") is {{regarded}} as negative movement, and <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> ("DR") is positive - the reverse of usual commercial accounting conventions.|$|R
50|$|As treasurer, O’Leary has {{introduced}} numerous innovations to the treasury operations of Arlington County, including the Pay at the Bank program in 1984, which allows Arlington tax payers {{to pay taxes}} at local bank branches; the Pay by Credit Card program, initiated in 1985, which made Arlington the fourth jurisdiction in Virginia to accept credit card payments for taxes; the Automated Payment System begun in 1987, which allows taxes to be automatically <b>debited</b> from <b>a</b> bank <b>account</b> or charged to a credit card; and the Tax Assist Program (later renamed the Taxpayer Assistance Program), begun in 1994, which makes secured loans to taxpayers in need of assistance to pay their taxes on time.|$|R
50|$|Virginia Tech {{has five}} meal plans to choose from, {{as well as}} dining dollars or cash. Three of the meal plans are major meal plans. All major meal plans have a $1067 base cost, {{used to pay for}} the {{operation}} of the dining halls, {{with the rest of the}} cost being used as <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> <b>account</b> for food spending. However, to make up for the base cost, major meal plan holders get a 50% discount at all dining halls except D2, which has a 67% discount. These meal plans, ranging from smallest to largest, are the Major Flex Plan, the Mega Flex Plan, and the Premium Flex Plan.|$|R
50|$|As {{a partial}} {{check that the}} posting process was done correctly, a working {{document}} called an unadjusted trial balance is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains {{the names of those}} accounts in the ledger which have a non-zero balance. If <b>an</b> <b>account</b> has <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the <b>debit</b> column); if <b>an</b> <b>account</b> has <b>a</b> credit balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the credit column). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree—which is not by chance—because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is <b>a</b> posting, the <b>debits</b> of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.|$|R
50|$|A {{sales journal}} is <b>a</b> {{specialized}} <b>accounting</b> journal {{and it is}} also a prime entry book used in <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> system {{to keep track of the}} sales of items that customers(debtors) have purchased on <b>account</b> by charging <b>a</b> receivable on the <b>debit</b> side of <b>an</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable account and crediting revenue on the credit side. It differs from the cash receipts journal in that the latter will serve to book sales when cash is received.The sales journal is used to record all of the company sales on credit. Most often these sales are made up of inventory sales or other merchandise sales. Notice that only credit sales of inventory and merchandise items are recorded in the sales journal. Cash sales of inventory are recorded in the cash receipts journal. Both cash and credit sales of non-inventory or merchandise are recorded in the general journal.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and <b>debits</b> <b>a</b> lease {{receivable}} <b>account</b> {{for the present}} value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor capital lease, called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|R
50|$|Whether <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> {{increases}} or decreases <b>an</b> <b>account</b> {{depends on}} what kind of account it is. An increase to <b>an</b> asset <b>account</b> is <b>a</b> <b>debit.</b> An increase to a liability or to <b>an</b> equity <b>account</b> is <b>a</b> credit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{credit card}} issuing bank {{receives}} the authorization request, verifies the credit or debit available and then sends a response {{back to the}} processor (via the same process as the request for authorization) with a response code (I.e.:: approved, denied). In addition to communicating {{the fate of the}} authorization request, the response code is also used to define the reason why the transaction failed (I.e.: insufficient funds, or bank link not available). Meanwhile, the credit card issuer holds an authorization associated with that merchant and consumer for the approved amount. This can impact the consumer's ability to spend further ( [...] because it reduces the line of credit available or it puts a hold on a portion of the funds in <b>a</b> <b>debit</b> <b>account).</b>|$|R
