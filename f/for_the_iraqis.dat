25|$|In May 1941, {{to add to}} British {{troubles}} in the area, there was a coup d'état against the pro-British government in Iraq. A pro-German ruler took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around Basra and at Habbaniya north east of Baghdad. Basra was too well defended <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to consider taking. However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated {{in the middle of}} enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.|$|E
25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E

On January 10, 2007, Senator Dick Durbin gave the Democratic response to this plan by saying: [...] "We have given the Iraqis so much. ...

50|$|Iran {{managed to}} regain 100 sq mi {{of its own}} {{territory}} (part of the disputed territory). But {{after a week of}} stalemate, Iran abandoned the operation after making only minimal gains against the Iraqis. Rafsanjani later retracted his earlier boast, saying that the offensive was not the last as expected. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> this victory helped the poorly trained and shaken ground forces to boost their morale.|$|E
50|$|As {{it became}} clear that the war was over <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> some of their captors {{approached}} a Marine unit from the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon which was a part of Task Force Tripoli that had been pushing up toward Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the area}} around the Shatt al-Arab posed no {{obstacle}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> as they possessed river crossing equipment. Iraq correctly deduced that Iran's defences at the crossing points around the Karkheh and Karoun Rivers were undermanned and that the rivers could be easily crossed. Iraqi intelligence was also informed that the Iranian forces in Khuzestan (which consisted of two divisions prior to the revolution) now only consisted of several ill-equipped and under-strength battalions. Only a handful of company-sized tank units remained operational.|$|E

Pentagon planners say those currently counted as combat troops could be [...] "re-missioned" [...] and that their efforts could be redefined as training and support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm.

50|$|The Iraqis, {{on their}} side, call the Iranians Furs, a {{somewhat}} derogatory term in medieval times, with {{a suggestion that}} the Persians were the heirs of the Zoroastrians defeated {{at the battle of}} Qadisiyya in AD 637. This battle, which shattered the military power of the Iranian emperors and led to the incorporation of all their lands and peoples in the Muslim Arab Empire, is claimed with pride by both sides. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> it was a victory of Arabs over Persians... For the soldiers of the Islamic Republic, it was victory of Muslims over heathens, and a blessed beginning of the Islamization of the peoples of Iran.|$|E

50|$|In March 2014 Counsel acting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> {{conceded that}} the murder {{allegations}} would not be pursued in closing submissions. The Al-Sweady Inquiry nevertheless went on to make detailed findings and found that no Iraqis had been murdered by British troops during the battle and that the allegations of unlawful killings were based on “deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility” by the Iraqi plaintiffs. The detainees {{were found to have}} been mistreated in a number of respects, although the most serious allegations of abuse were rejected. As a result, Leigh Day and Public Interest Lawyers (which closed in August 2016) were referred to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority for possible disciplinary action.|$|E
50|$|The attack {{had been}} planned for an {{unsuitable}} location, which complicated the matter even further. The terrain around Susangerd was muddy and prone to seasonal flooding and rain turned the ground into a quagmire, the area {{was in many ways}} unsuitable for proper armored maneuver. The Iranians would have to attack slowly in a straight column on surface roads, with the infantry support {{at the tail end of}} the column. That meant the tanks would be moving forward unprotected, and with their flanks exposed. Worse, this movement would be easily detected by Iraqi helicopters. The distance the Iranian forces had to penetrate was also extremely lengthy, and it was easy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to counterattack and reinforce their troops, running counter to Iran's plan of achieving surprise.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1923, British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions {{over the}} new oil concession. The major {{obstacle}} was Iraq's insistence on a 20 percent equity participation in the company; this figure had {{been included in the}} original TPC concession to the Turks and had been agreed upon at Sanremo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> In the end, despite strong nationalist sentiments against the concession agreement, the Iraqi negotiators acquiesced to it. The League of Nations was soon to vote on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area to Turkey. In March 1925, an agreement was concluded that contained none of the Iraqi demands. The TPC, now renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), was granted a full and complete concession for a period of seventy-five years.|$|E

Later {{in the tour}} the Squadron deployed into Basra City, working from Basra Palace, as part of Op SINBAD, which involved the repair of schools, hospitals and other public amenities. The Squadron, along {{with the help of}} the RAF, pioneered a new way of replacing damaged or looted pylons that were having a drastic impact on the quality of life <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> A Chinook helicopter lifted the 4.5 tonnes pylons from BAS and flew them to location where sappers from 37 and Iraqi Engineers were on the ground ready to fix them down. They erected a total of 30 pylons using this method.|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 1986, Saddam sent one of {{his best}} commanders, General Maher Abd al-Rashid, and the Republican Guard to begin a new {{offensive}} to recapture al-Faw.20 The force consisted of Iraq's V Corps, with two mechanized divisions. Nevertheless, even the elite of Iraqi troops, while fighting ferociously, used poor tactics and relied on trying to evict the Iranians through sheer brute force. Iraq fired over 600 rounds of ammunition and launched 200 sorties of aircraft every single day, using both high explosive and large quantities of chemical weapons. Their most widely used chemical weapon was mustard gas, which paralyzed Iranian activity on the battlefield, and killed 700-1,800 immediately. 8,000 were stricken, and many more would eventually die afterward. The poison gas may have been the deadliest weapon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> fighting the Iranians.|$|E

In a June 24, 2004, interview with the Vacaville Reporter, published soon after the meeting, she stated, [...] "We haven't been happy with the way the war has been handled.
