Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new thing. If it doesn't lend itself to your history, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> to extend to your future?"

If we know what needs to come out, we know what we need to put into the system. The program we select will need to appropriately handle the process. The system is built with control files, sample master records, and the ability to perform processes on a test basis. The system is designed to include appropriate internal controls and to provide management with the information needed to make decisions. It is a goal of an accounting information system to provide information that is relevant, meaningful, reliable, useful, and current. To achieve this, the system is designed so that transactions are entered as they occur (either manually or electronically) and information is immediately available online for management.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Semantic Web is a {{promising}} step toward improving virtual community information systems. It gives information a clearer meaning, better enabling computers and people to cooperate. However, still lacking {{is the purpose}} of the information: <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> to be used and evolve? In a Pragmatic Web, the context of the information would be defined as well, as the community examines goal-based conditional inferences in its work in progress. Scientific collaboratories could benefit substantially from such an approach. The PORT collaboratory was established to provide a model for pragmatic collaboratory evolution. In this paper, we outline a pragmatic community information systems development process by combining PORT with the Conceptual Graphs-based RENISYS method for the legitimate user-driven specification of community information systems. Peircean pragmatism provides a self-critical approach for tool selection in virtual communities. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is undeniably playing {{a very significant}} role in our day-to-day life. A vast and inter-connected web of flights ensures swift passenger travel and cargo traffic. However, {{in the name of}} security, otherwise intrinsic technicalities tend now not only to hinder on further development of aviation facilitation but also take over and lead towards the exact opposite result. What are the current measures taken by the international community to streamline passenger travel? What are the new initiatives which ought to be implemented? How is the future of aviation facilitation going to look like? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> to affect air travel and what legal implications is it rising? Throughout this thesis we will present the legal framework applicable to aviation facilitation and discuss the main initiatives that are being considered by ICAO and IATA in this respect. While Facilitation and Security should be considered as "two faces of the same coin", in reality they appear to "compete" against each other. Hence, we will provide our arguments in support of this theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this research proposal is to see how components {{can be used to}} map information from one system to an other. To do this a number of different problems must be addressed, and three groups of problems can be found. The first is how components work and how the other problems can benefit from that. The second is mapping, both syntactically and semantically. What information is needed and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> {{to be used in the}} components? Lastly, processes need to be found and modelled, that is what activities are actually done in the system and how do they work together? All the problems need to be address iteratively since they depend on each other. The result of this research proposal is the preliminary problem statement “How can components be used and constructed to be able to map information from one system to another while retaining the semantic value of the information?”. This is going to be explored in two projects, the first one using an in-house produced reference database as a prototype. The second project will use the knowledge gathered from the first and apply it to a real-world system. ...|$|E

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} young people’s learning motivation. Taking as inspiration the claims by several authors in the book Unges motivaiton og læring (2013), about the perception of a dominating “motivations crisis” affecting young people today, we initiated our research by giving attention to several selected concerns of interest to understanding young people’s involvement in the current school system. Upon these we produced and applied an interview to 9 th grader students, concerning their individual experience and opinions about going to school. The interview results’ analysis allowed us to focus on four central statements or topics to advance for further analysis based in this case on a theoretical framework that we developed with inspiration by Thomas Ziehe and Gert Biesta. The four statements or topics that we found relevant to link theoretically to the discussion on student’s motivation are: 1) <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> to school? 2) Subject and content 3) teacher and teaching method 4) motivation. Our analysis revealed that is not lack of motivation but rather {{it is a question}} of school fatigue and reluctance, which is interpreted as lack of motivation. A complete understanding on the question of young people’s motivation requires use of several theoretical approaches, and it is dependent on the selection of particular theories and scientific approaches from which the researcher is considering this topic...|$|E
40|$|This year's report {{represents}} the third installment of volume three and the 13 th issue overall since the publication began in 2000. Three studies are presented. All three revisit {{a topic that}} has been investigated in a previous Brown Center Report. The topics warrant attention again because they {{are back in the}} public spotlight. Part one summarizes the recent controversy involving the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and its treatment of Shanghai-China. The PISA is a test given to 15 -year-olds every three years in math, reading, and science. Sixty-five national and subnational jurisdictions participated in the 2012 PISA. When the scores were released in December 2013, no one was surprised that Shanghai-China scored at the top in all subjects. But what has been overlooked by most observers [...] and completely ignored by the authorities running PISA [...] is that Shanghai's population of 15 -year-olds is sifted and shaped in ways that make its scores incomparable to those of any other participant. Part two is on homework, updating a study presented in the 2003 Brown Center Report. That study was conducted at a time when homework was on the covers of several popular magazines. The charge then was that the typical student's homework load was getting out of control. The 2003 study examined the best evidence on students' homework burden and found the charge to be an exaggeration. Now, {{a little more than a}} decade later, homework is again under attack. The current study finds little evidence that the homework load has increased for the average student. Those with a heavy burden, two or more hours of homework per night, do indeed exist, but they are a distinct minority. Part three is on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Forty-five states have signed on to the Common Core and are busy implementing the standards. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going?</b> Admittedly, the Common Core era is only in the early stages [...] new tests and accountability systems based on the standards are a couple of years away [...] but states have had three or four years under the standards.
