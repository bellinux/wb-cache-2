The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|E

One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> of crops, especially in the east and south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, and walnuts. There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa.

[...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E

2500|$|Major {{corporations}} {{all over}} the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as [...] "quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information". These third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry. Independent certification can show a company's dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dismantling}} of the false self [...] "leaves the impaired real self {{with the opportunity to}} convert its potential and its possibilities into actualities." [...] Working through brings unique rewards, of which the most important element <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> realization that the individual has a fundamental, internal need for relatedness that may be expressed in a variety of ways. [...] "Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, [...] "who have worked through the abandonment depression... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who the patients are and what they contain as human beings. It is this sense that finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally. For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} alarming, as a symptom, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> indifference, in which men indulge themselves, to other men's {{religious}} sentiments. Under the guise of charity and toleration we are come almost to this pass; that no difference, in matters of faith, is to disqualify for our approbation and confidence, whether in public or domestic life. Can we conceal it from ourselves, that every year the practice is becoming more common, of trusting men unreservedly in the most delicate and important matters, without one serious inquiry, whether they do not hold principles which {{make it impossible for}} them to be loyal to their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier? Are not offices conferred, partnerships formed, intimacies courted,—nay (what is almost too painful to think of), do not parents commit their children to be educated, do they not encourage them to intermarry, in houses, on which Apostolical Authority would rather teach them to set a mark, as unfit to be entered by a faithful servant of Christ? ...|$|E
2500|$|Organized {{crime is}} {{involved}} in the production and distribution of child pornography, which is found as a common element of organized crime profiles. Organized into groups to produce and distribute pornography, they are often called [...] "sex rings." [...] In 2003, an international police investigation uncovered a Germany-based child pornography ring involving 26,500 suspects who swapped illegal images on the Internet in 166 different countries. In a 2006 case, US and international authorities charged 27 people in nine states and three countries in connection with a child pornography ring that US federal authorities described as [...] "one of the worst" [...] they have discovered. The assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement added that the case reflected three larger trends that are becoming more common in child pornography rings. One is the increasing prevalence of [...] "home-grown" [...] pornographic images that are produced by predators themselves, and include live streaming video images of children being abused, not just the circulation of repeated images. Another trend <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> use of sophisticated security measures and of peer-to-peer networking, in which participants can share files with one another on their computers rather than downloading them from a web site. The group used encryption and data destruction software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorized participants could enter the chat room. A third trend is the increasingly violent and graphic nature of the images involving the abuse of younger children.|$|E

60|$|Above this {{fundamental}} mass <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> moiety {{which has a}} conscious thought-process, of a sort. Its fundamental ideas, its preconceptions, are begotten of a mixture of social traditions learnt {{at home and in}} school and from the suggestions of contemporary customs and affairs. But it reads and listens more or less. And scattered through this, here and there, are people really learning, really increasing and accumulating knowledge, really thinking and conversing--the active mind-cells, as it were, of the world. Their ideas are conveyed into the mass much as impulses are conveyed into an imperfectly innervated tissue, they are conveyed by books and pamphlets, by lecturing, by magazine articles and newspaper articles, by the agency of the pulpit, by organized propaganda, by political display and campaigns. The gross effect is considerable, but it is just as well that the Socialist should look a little closely at the economic processes that underlie these intellectual activities at the present time. Except for the universities and much of the public educational organization, except for a few pulpits endowed for good under conditions that limit freedom of thought and expression, except for certain needy and impecunious propagandas, the whole of this apparatus of public thought and discussion to-day has been created and is sustained by commercial necessity.|$|E
