500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E

Allenby went on, [...] "As long as military operations were in progress <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> I was in supreme command, and that all administration must be under my control.

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> law professors {{who claim to}} have proven {{that the stock market}} cannot be {{efficient}} have based their case on economic models contain hidden assumptions which are nonsense. Specifically, the assumption that investors have no wealth constraint and can borrow unlimited amounts of capital is nonsense. <b>I</b> further <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the frequently touted claim that many investors are irrational is not relevant to the debate about market efficiency because when real world characteristics of financial markets are imposed - markets clear, budget constraints are satisfied, and investors face credit limits - markets will be efficient regardless of the mental capacity of investors...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I provide an {{overview}} of Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s ethics with an emphasis on showing how his naturalistic approach to ethics leads him to advance an egoistic moral code. I argue that this, though radical in the light of conventional morality, is not irrational, unprincipled, or proscriptive of other-regarding moral considerations. On the contrary, it demands the highest degree of foresight and integrity. While Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s writings are meant for a select group of people, namely 2 ̆ 2 higher men, 2 ̆ 2 whose flourishing may be undercut by their unwitting acceptance of a self-destructive morality. <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche places the highest degree of value on the life of these individuals, the development of their character, and their flourishing. Further, <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche extols as a great virtue 2 ̆ 2 bestowing 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 gift-giving, 2 ̆ 2 and that he takes generosity to be more frequently practiced under an ethics of egoism...|$|R
