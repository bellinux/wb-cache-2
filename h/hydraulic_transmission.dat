5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of British Rail's second generation passenger DMU stock used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century designs using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> include Bombardier's Turbostar, Talent, RegioSwinger families; diesel engined {{versions}} of Siemens's Desiro platform, and the Stadler Regio-Shuttle.|$|E
50|$|Voith had {{supplied}} {{components to}} the railway industry since the 1930s - in particular its <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|These buses {{were all}} 40 ft long and 102 in wide, and were {{equipped}} with GM 6V71 engines to Allison <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first four-car set, {{powered by}} four 240 {{horsepower}} horizontal in-line six cylinder, four stroke Hercules DFXH-F diesel engines (2 per power car) coupled to Torcon <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> entered {{service on the}} North Coast Daylight Express between Sydney and Grafton in November 1951. The engines and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> proved unreliable and the set was withdrawn in May 1952 after {{less than six months}} in service. The construction of further vehicles was suspended until a satisfactory solution could be found.|$|R
25|$|Around 1960, {{the first}} diesel-hydraulic were produced. Other {{builders}} {{had shown that}} a type of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> called a ‘multi-stage torque converter’, was cheap to buy, needed very little maintenance and was very easy to use. YEC immediately found customers for these locomotives and {{increased the number of}} designs available.|$|E
25|$|The trains {{feature a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> {{supplied}} by Voith {{which is a}} three-speed type, with integral hydrodynamic braking (rated at 750kW short term, 420kW continuous). These trains are the only diesel-powered high-speed trains {{in the world with}} diesel-hydraulic transmission. One bogie per coach is powered, with both axles driven. Total vehicle weight is 278 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|In Germany and Finland, diesel–hydraulic {{systems have}} {{achieved}} high reliability in operation. In the UK the diesel–hydraulic principle gained a poor reputation {{due to the}} poor durability and reliability of the Maybach Mekydro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Argument continues over the relative reliability of hydraulic systems, with questions over whether data has been manipulated to favour local suppliers over non-German ones.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had a {{total power}} of [...] from 2 motors (each a 16-cylinder Maybach/Mercedes Benz MD870) diesel engine. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> used were two Mekydro K184.|$|R

5000|$|The most robust <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{were only}} capable of {{handling}} engines with power output of around 1500 hp (1120 kW); to build a more powerful locomotive would involve two diesel engines and two transmissions.|$|R
25|$|The Sprinter is {{a family}} of diesel {{multiple}} unit trains in use on the British railway system. They {{were built in the}} 1980s and early 1990s by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), Metro Cammell and Leyland. Most have a Cummins engine with Voith <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> although 47 class 158 units have a Perkins engine instead. Sprinters can be seen operating in almost every part of Great Britain, from rural branch lines to commuter expresses into major cities.|$|E
25|$|Diesel–hydraulic {{locomotives}} {{are less}} efficient than diesel–electrics. The first-generation BR diesel hydraulics {{were significantly less}} efficient (c. 65%) than diesel electrics (c. 80%) — moreover initial versions were found in many countries to be mechanically more complicated {{and more likely to}} break down. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> for locomotives was developed in Germany. There is still debate over the relative merits of hydraulic vs. electrical transmission systems: advantages claimed for hydraulic systems include lower weight, high reliability, and lower capital cost.|$|E
25|$|Prejudice against <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> in {{the higher}} echelons of BR's {{engineering}} divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the fitment of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> permit greater design flexibility. While early {{examples}} used direct mechanical drives, hydraulics {{reduce the}} number of moving parts exposed to contamination and allows the drum to be driven, providing extra traction on inclines.|$|R
50|$|The DRC (Diesel Rail Car) was a {{class of}} railmotor {{operated}} by the Victorian Railways on its country rail network Victoria, Australia. The cars were built by Tulloch Limited in New South Wales and featured aluminum and steel construction, air-conditioning, and twin diesel engines with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{number of}} plans {{were made for}} the post-war {{completion}} of the ships, including modifying the turrets to load at a fixed angle of +4° to reduce the weight {{and complexity of the}} loading equipment. Another intended change was to lengthen the funnels by [...] to minimise smoke interference with the bridge, as this had been noted as a problem on the Gangut-class dreadnoughts. There were suggestions to improve the machinery with geared turbines, turbo-electric drive, or Föttinger's <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> but these were more theoretical than practical.|$|E
500|$|The Class 47 history {{begins in}} the early 1960s with the stated aim of the British Transport Commission (BTC) to {{completely}} remove steam locomotives from British Rail by a target date of 1968. They therefore required a large build of lightweight Type 4 locomotives to achieve this aim. [...] This required locomotives producing at least [...] but with an axle load {{of no more than}} [...] [...] However, the BTC were not convinced that the future of diesel traction lay down the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> path of the Western Region, and began looking at various diesel-electric designs.|$|E
2500|$|Each Redhen had two under-floor {{diesel engines}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Engines were sourced from either General Motors or Rolls Royce as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Rolls-Royce {{devised a}} system which enabled DMUs with {{mechanical}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> to work together. The British Rail Class 127 units were fitted with this system and given the standard Blue Square coupling code, instead of the Orange Star code given to the British Rail Class 125 units.|$|R
5000|$|The NBL-built D800s {{differed}} mechanically {{from the}} Swindon-built batch: the Swindon locomotives used Maybach engines connected to Mekydro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> whereas the NBL-built examples used MAN engines and Voith transmissions. NBL had entered into an {{arrangement with the}} German company MAN AG in the early 1950s to market MAN's engine designs in the UK: NBL were anxious to enter the diesel locomotive market, especially once {{it became apparent that}} British Railways would be seeking large quantities of such locomotives when the [...] "Modernisation Plan" [...] was announced. MAN were equally keen to obtain a slice of the UK market for themselves. The first results of this collaboration were the D600-D604 locomotives which failed {{to take advantage of the}} weight-saving potential of light alloy stressed-skin construction allied to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1990s, the Army LCM-8 {{received}} {{a life of}} type extension with a re-engine program. The original twin-pac 6-71 two-stroke Detroit Diesel engines and Allison mechanical transmissions were replaced with 8v-92 Silver Series Detroit Diesel engines and Allison <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Transmissions</b> thus extending {{the life of the}} craft for another 20 years.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{motor car}} had one powered bogie which was {{powered by a}} Maybach V12 prime mover rated at , {{allowing}} the trains to each [...] via a Voith <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The trains were [...] long overall, weighing [...] They had space for 145 passengers, and included a saloon, kitchen and cargo room.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these, No.1, was [...] long and seated 61 passengers. It had a {{traditionally}} constructed wooden body and was powered by two Leyland [...] petrol engines with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in the form}} of Lysholm-Smith torque converters. No.1 was re-engined with Leyland diesels in 1947 and again in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|Railcars Nos.3 and 4 {{were built}} in 1935 and 1938 {{respectively}} and were virtually identical. Like No.2, they were [...] long with elevated driving positions but there the similarity ended as the cars had [...] "air smoothed" [...] bodywork. Each seating 80 passengers, they too were powered by two [...] Leyland Diesel engines with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tests {{conducted}} with 354-002 and 354-003 between Seville and Jerez had achieved {{a speed of}} 160 km/h without encountering any significant problems. However breakdowns of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> occur, whilst some units still being in production at the Krauss-Maffei factory in Munich; the unfinished units have the problem corrected before being delivered.|$|R

2500|$|The Western Region of British Railways {{had decided}} upon <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> with {{lightweight}} alloy construction {{for its new}} diesel locomotives to replace [...] "King" [...] and [...] "Castle" [...] class steam locomotives. This was {{partly because of the}} stiff gradients between Exeter and Plymouth on the Exeter to Plymouth line: to save fuel compared with hauling the additional weight of the locomotive up these gradients and allow an extra revenue-earning passenger coach {{to be added to the}} train.|$|E
2500|$|The Zooliner is a 5/8-scale {{replica of}} the {{diesel-powered}} Aerotrain, which {{is famous for its}} unusual shape that was influenced by automobile designs of the period when it was built, considered futuristic at the time. The Zooliner was built in 1958, its mechanical parts by Northwest Marine Iron Works and its streamlined bodywork by the H. Hirschberger Sheet Metal company of Portland. It first carried passengers in June 1958. [...] The Zooliner is powered by a [...] diesel engine with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> which is WP Railway locomotive No. 2. The brakes are pneumatic, the same as on its full-size namesake. [...] The train includes four or five streamlined passenger coaches pulled by matching locomotive No. 2. The rearmost car was rebuilt in late 2005 to resemble a dome car, in connection with installation of a larger and more powerful wheelchair lift.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{specifically}} includes {{features for}} safety, reliability and appearance. In place of cardan shaft drives to the wheels, coupling rods {{were used to}} give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give {{a good view of}} the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the exhaust silencer. For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at [...] and drives through a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> that has only one drive ratio. The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012–13 in readiness for the launch of the new [...] "traditional diesel" [...] service.|$|E
50|$|Initially diesel {{machines}} using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> TG101, TG102, TG105, TG106 (ТГ101, ТГ102, ТГ105, ТГ106) were produced, though eventually electrical (DC) transmissions {{became the}} norm on Russian railways, such as mainline locomotive type 2TE10L (2ТЭ10Л) and its variants, which started production at Luhansk in 1962, eventually more than 12,000 units had been produced. In 1965 the first M62 locomotive was produced at the plant.|$|R
50|$|Voith, a {{well known}} {{manufacture}} of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmissions</b> and other locomotive components entered the locomotive building business in 2006 with {{the launch of}} the Voith Maxima locomotives at InnoTrans.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the impacts of the {{biodegradable}} <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transmission</b> fluid (Universal Tractor Transmission Oil) on operation of tractor <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transmission</b> systems. The fluid was used in the <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transmission</b> systems of a Zetor Proxima 6321 tractor. Fluid samples were taken from the Zetor Proxima 6321 tractor at intervals of 250 engine hours. These samples were subjected to an infrared spectroscopy analysis in order to measure the total acid number and perform the ferrography analysis. This paper proves minimal impacts of the biodegradable hydraulic fluid on operation of the Zetor Proxima 6321 tractor. The biodegradable fluid meets the requirements for the operation of agricultural tractors in terms of low impacts on the wear of hydraulic components...|$|R
