40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the effectiveness of grounding pins and high-frequency absorbers to reduce the emissions of <b>heatsinks</b> up to 20 GHz. The study considers four different types of excitations, namely a direct excitation, an excitation by a patch antenna, an excitation by a microstrip below the center of the <b>heatsink,</b> and an excitation by a microstrip that was off-set with respect {{to the center of the}} <b>heatsink.</b> Grounding post are positioned equidistantly along the edges of the <b>heatsink</b> and the number of grounding pins per side is varied. Adding grounding pins significantly reduces the emission of the <b>heatsink</b> below 1 - 2 GHz. At higher frequencies, they lose their capability to reduce the <b>heatsink</b> emission and even introduce extra resonance frequencies where the emission is higher compared to the ungrounded <b>heatsink.</b> Three different possible arrangements for the application of absorbing material were considered, namely a thin flat absorber just below the <b>heatsink,</b> a ring absorber between the <b>heatsink</b> and the PCB, and a collar absorber around the <b>heatsink.</b> The absorber succeeds in reducing the <b>heatsink’s</b> emission above 1 - 2 GHz, but has little of no positive effect on the emissions below 1 - 2 GHz. Only by the combination of the grounding pins and the absorber material, a reduction of the <b>heatsink’s</b> emission is achieved over the full frequency range. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHeatsinks {{have long}} been used for cooling of {{electronic}} components to maintain them under the maximum allowed operational temperature. Forced air cooling with <b>heatsink</b> is suitable and enough efficient for low power applications cooling.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, thermal {{analysis}} of <b>heatsink</b> for 30 W class Chip-on-Board (COB) LED light source is performed by using SolidWorks Flow Simulation package.

Furthermore, a copper spread is applied between the COB LED light source and the <b>heatsink</b> to mitigate the heat concentration on the <b>heatsink.</b> With the copper spread, the junction temperature between the COB LED light source and the <b>heatsink</b> is 50. 9 ℃, which is 5. 4 ℃ lower than the <b>heatsink</b> without the copper spread. Due to the improvement of the junction temperature, the light output is improved by 5. 8 % when the LED light source is stabilized.

5000|$|Dahl - One of {{the poorer}} {{sections}} of Trantor. [...] The main {{job of the}} lower class is <b>heatsinking,</b> where workers supervise the conversion of heat from the planet's core directly into electric power by sinking extremely long rods into the inner core of the planet (the three other major sources of electric power were hydroelectric dams on the underground rivers, fusion energy, and solar energy from Trantor's sun, both from rooftop solar arrays and from solar energy satellites orbiting Trantor that beamed microwave energy to the surface); 'heatsinkers' were generally looked down upon by other Dahlites. Naturally, most Dahlites hated the Empire and its soldiers (colloquially labelled 'sunbadgers'). Dahlites were dark skinned, black-haired, and fairly short. Dahlite males wore large, thick mustaches, and all carried knives (considered to be primitive weapons). Rather than using 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', or 'Dr.', as forms of address, Dahlites always used 'Master' and 'Mistress' (never 'Doctor'). The name Dahl may be reference to the Indian dalit or untouchable caste.

5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the <b>heatsinking</b> needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing switching losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.|$|E

These devices have achieved spectral performance of dE approximately 1. 3 eV FWHM at 1. 5 keV, 1. 6 eV at 6 keV, and 2. 0 eV at 8 keV, using small TESs (e. g., approximately 35 micron x 35 micron) that operate in a regime in which the superconducting transition is highly current dependent. In order to accommodate high X-ray count rates, the devices sit directly on a solid substrate instead of on membranes, and we use an embedded <b>heatsinking</b> layer to reduce pixel-to-pixel crosstalk.

We have based the subarrays of our current design on successful pixel designs that have been demonstrated separately. Pixels with an all-gold X-ray absorber on 50 and 75 micron pitch, where the Mo/Au TES sits atop a thick metal <b>heatsinking</b> layer, have shown high resolution and can accommodate high count rates. The demonstrated larger pixels use a silicon nitride membrane for thermal isolation, thinner Au, and an added bismuth layer in a 250 -sq micron absorber. To tune the parameters of each subarray requires merging the fabrication processes of the two detector types. We present the fabrication process for dual production of different X-ray absorbers on the same substrate, thick Au on the small pixels and thinner Au with a Bi capping layer on the larger pixels to tune their heat capacities. The process requires multiple electroplating and etching steps, but the absorbers are defined in a single-ion milling step. We demonstrate methods for integrating the <b>heatsinking</b> of the two types of pixel into the same focal plane consistent with the requirements for each subarray, including the limiting of thermal crosstalk.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of high-power diode lasers, which are cooled by standard copper <b>heatsinks,</b> is limited. The reasons are {{the aging of}} the indium solder normally employed as well as the mechanical stress caused by the mismatch between the copper <b>heatsink</b> (16 - 17 ppm/K) and the GaAs diode laser bars (6 - 7. 5 ppm/K). For micro - channel <b>heatsinks</b> corrosion and erosion of the micro channels limit the lifetime additionally. The different thermal behavior and the resulting stress cannot be compensated totally by the solder. Expansion matched <b>heatsink</b> materials like tungsten-copper or aluminum nitride reduce this stress. A further possible solution is a combination of copper and molybdenum layers, but all these materials have a high thermal resistance in common.
