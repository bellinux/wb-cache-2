40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{with the}} {{deepening}} of China's reform and opening up policy, the rapid {{development of the}} national economy and urban high-rise buildings and underground engineering increasing, many kinds of malignant fire have become increasingly complex and frequent. In {{the event of a}} fire, it may cause great loss of life, serious injuries and state property. In the absence of the necessary rescue equipment, fire brigade and emergency departments in fire and explosion engineering, engineering rescue and various natural disasters will delay the rescue, even can do nothing to rescue. This proves the <b>forcible</b> <b>entry</b> <b>tools</b> {{play a significant role in}} fire fighting and rescue. Therefore, the fire brigade and rescue departments should equip with efficient <b>forcible</b> <b>entry</b> <b>tools</b> for rescue as soon as possible. Status of the domestic forcible entry equipments Forcible entry is one of the primary means of rescue in fires, traffic accidents as well as building collapses and other disaster scenes.

5000|$|The exact {{origin of}} the claw tool is not well documented, however most in the FDNY agree on its folklorish origin. As the story goes, a fire was started in a lower Manhattan bank in order to {{cover-up}} a burglary. Within the rubble, firefighters found an odd tool with a claw-like end. Upon investigation, {{it was determined that}} the tool was used by the burglars to break into the bank. The firefighters had thought that if the tool was good enough to break into a bank, it was good enough for their use. This unusual tool was labeled [...] "The claw tool". Soon the claw tool was reproduced many times over, and became the primary <b>forcible</b> <b>entry</b> <b>tool</b> used by the FDNY. It is believed that the claw tool was the first tool designed solely for <b>forcible</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|R
