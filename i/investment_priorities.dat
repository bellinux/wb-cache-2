The school's dining halls strive to be environmentally sustainable by working to expand their local and organic offerings, recycling in all dining areas, and recycling used fry oil as bio-diesel fuel. The dining halls previously offered biodegradable takeout containers, but reverted to Styrofoam in the 2009/10 academic year. Additionally, all leftover food is donated to a local food bank. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Bryn Mawr received a C+. The school's highest category score was an A in <b>Investment</b> <b>Priorities,</b> since Bryn Mawr invests in renewable energy funds, but the score was brought down by lower grades in categories like Green Building (in which the school earned a D, since the campus currently features no green buildings).|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} discuss the aspects of {{financial}} operation via cash-flow analysis in large-scale dairy farm management that strategically aims to expand its operation further. The conclusions are as follows. First, when trying to analyze management {{in the process of}} dynamic expansion, {{there was a significant difference}} in evaluating between the management analysis method with its emphasis on profitability, versus one with an emphasis on cash flow and stability. It becomes important to diagnose financial stability based on cash flow when evaluating large amounts of investment and dairy farm management in the process of further expansion. Second, the <b>investment</b> timing and <b>priority</b> were deeply related to the increase and decrease in cash amount. In dairy farm management, the production process goes through multiple stages such as feeding, raising and milking, thus decision-making concerning where to place <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> among various sectors becomes highly critical. Especially for the type of large-scale, extensive land use dairy farming seen in Hokkaido, <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> should be placed on milking (including the purchase of new cattle) rather than upgrading the feeding stage in order to stabilize financial operation...|$|R
