Due to their high accuracy they are used for absolute position and rotation measurement in manned/unmanned vehicles, e. g. submarines, ground vehicles, aircraft or satellites. The important system components are the light source, the electro optical phase modulator, the optical <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> and the photodetector. This paper is focused on approaches to realize a stable light source and <b>fiber</b> <b>coil.</b> Superluminescent diode and erbium doped fiber laser were studied to realize an accurate and stable light source. Therefor {{the influence of the}} polarization grade of the source and the effects due to back reflections to the source were studied. During operation thermal working conditions severely affect accuracy and stability of the optical <b>fiber</b> <b>coil,</b> which is the sensor element. Thermal gradients that are applied to the <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> have large negative effects on the achievable system accuracy of the op tic gyroscope. Therefore a way of calculating and compensating the rotation rate error of a <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> due to thermal change is introduced. A simplified 3 dimensional FEM of a quadrupole wound <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> is used to determine the build-up of thermal fields in the polarization maintaining fiber due to outside heating sources. The rotation rate error due to these sources is then calculated and compared to measurement data. A simple regression model is used to compensate the rotation rate error with temperature measurement at the outside of the <b>fiber</b> <b>coil.</b> To realize a compact and robust optical package for some of the relevant optical system components an approach based on ion exchanged waveguides in thin glass was developed.

40|$|<b>Fiber</b> <b>coils</b> {{have a wide}} {{application}} in fiber optics, since the necessity of compact fiber devices has been solved winding the <b>fibers.</b> However, <b>coiled</b> <b>fibers</b> show regularly a stress induced birefringence which {{needs to be taken}} into account. In general, it is only when two or three coils are combined that their polarization effects are not only considered relevant, but are used to control the state of polarization of light. These devices, known as polarization controllers, rely on the birefringence properties of the <b>fiber</b> <b>coils</b> and their relative orientation. The polarization performance of a three-ring polarization controller has been described assuming that the coil of each ring behaves as a quarter- or half-wave retarder [1]. This is a clear and useful approximation when the signal is monochromatic, but the verification of this assumption is not easy to accomplish. In this work we verify the similar performance of polarization controllers built with two helical coils and with three non-regular windings, applying them to the cancellation of the effect of birefringence on the output state of polarization of a signal.

40|$|Abstract—Fiber-optic {{acoustic}} sensors {{are being}} developed for the detection and location of partial discharges in oil-filled trans-formers. The partial discharges can be detected acoustically and located by the triangulation method with the sensors placed inside the transformer tank. In this application, the directionality of the sensor should be as flat as possible within at least 40 from the sensor axis and for a frequency range up to 150 kHz. A calcula-tion of the directionality of a <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> acoustic sensor was made using a plane wave approximation. The calculation showed that if the diameter of a <b>fiber</b> <b>coil</b> is less than 20 mm, its directionality is relatively flat within 40 for frequencies lower than 150 kHz. The directionality of an optical fiber acoustic sensor for the frequency range of 50 – 300 kHz was measured experimentally in an oil tank. The effect of reflected waves was avoided by using a gating technique. The experimental results show somewhat different directionality patterns from the theoretical results but are internally consistent and with maxima and minima at frequencies close to those predicted. The discrepancy {{is believed to be}} due to a resonance effect which is not taken into account in the theoretical model. However, the sensor achieves the directionality performance required for the application.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to study the load-elongation and creep behavior of water set single hair <b>fiber</b> <b>coils</b> at constant RH to provide some insights into their physical behavior. Single fibers were used instead of tresses to avoid complications from interfiber interactions and to simplify data interpretation. The first portion {{of this paper is}} concerned with measuring forces involved in stretching and recovery of single hair fibers water set as helical spirals. For initial uncoiling, the load is approximately proportional to the extension. With further extension a region is found in which load is proportional to the logarithm of the extension. However, as the fiber approaches traightness, once against he load is proportional to the extension. A large proportion of the extension is recoverable even after multiple extension-recovery cycles; however, some coil loss occurs, confirming a lack of true elasticity. The existence of creep confirms the absence of a true Hookean region for stretching water set single <b>fiber</b> <b>coils.</b> With no external load, most of the fiber creep (84 %) or uncoiling can be explained by fiber diameter, with thicker <b>fibers</b> resisting <b>coil</b> deformation better than thinner ones. With small added loads no meaningful relationship between creep and fiber diameter was found. However, the initial coil deflection with added load is significantly related to fiber diameter.
