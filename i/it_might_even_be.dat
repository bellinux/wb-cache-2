Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters {{commented that the}} band was a [...] "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that [...] "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." [...] Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory {{four out of five}} stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a [...] "two-star honorable mention rating", citing [...] "Papercut" [...] and [...] "Points of Authority" [...] as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album {{two and a half stars}} and commented that Hybrid Theory had [...] "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" [...] and called it an album that [...] "reflects the frustration of life". Considering that the album came out in the year 2000, and that it earned a Diamond certification, it may have exerted a similar rock influence on the up and coming Millennial generation that Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) did for Generation X. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible to say, because of the popularity of this album, that Linkin Park could be thought of as the [...] "flagship" [...] rock band for the Millennials. This generation tends to gravitate more towards rap and pop music; and having these elements mixed into Linkin Park's style might have played a role in the album's success.|$|E

60|$|Which way soever {{the truth}} might lie, he {{repeated}} to himself {{what he had}} said to Mordecai--that he could not without farther reasons undertake to hasten its discovery. Nay, he was tempted now to regard his uncertainty as a condition to be cherished for the present. If further intercourse revealed nothing but illusions as what he was expected to share in, the want of any valid evidence that he was a Jew might save Mordecai the worst shock in the refusal of fraternity. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> justifiable to use the uncertainty on this point in keeping up a suspense which would induce Mordecai to accept those offices of friendship that Deronda longed to urge on him.|$|E
60|$|As she {{sat alone}} in her bed-room, five or six hours after this interview, she felt some regret that she should leave Clavering without a word to Fanny on the subject. Mr. Saul had exacted no promise of secresy from her; {{he was not a}} man to exact such promises. But she felt not the less that she would be betraying {{confidence}} to speak, and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> that her speaking on the matter would do more harm than good. Her sympathies were doubtless with Mr. Saul, but she could not therefore say that she, thought Fanny ought to accept his love. It would be best {{to say nothing of the}} matter, and to allow Mr. Saul to fight his own battle.|$|E

They were not stuffed with our fashionable fiction, with its stiff and wooden figures of a good man named Washington and a bad man named Boney. They at least were aware that Washington's cause was not so obviously white nor Napoleon's so obviously black as most books in general circulation would indicate. They had a natural admiration for the military genius of Washington and Napoleon; they had the most unmixed contempt for the German Royal Family. But they were, as a class, not only against both Washington and Napoleon, but against them both for the same reason. And it was that they both stood for democracy.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is a small}} {{performance}} reduction for multi-rank {{systems as}} they require some pipeline stalls between accessing different ranks. For two ranks on a single DIMM <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> required, but this parameter is often programmed independently of the rank location in the system (if on the same DIMM or different DIMMs). Nevertheless, this pipeline stall is negligible compared to the aforementioned effects.|$|R
60|$|If Rachel {{had been}} talking to Ermine she might have been asked whether the dissimilarity might not be in the foundations, or in the {{tempering}} of the mortar, but Mr. Mauleverer only commended her liberal spirit, and she thought it high time to turn from this subject to the immediate one in hand. He had wished to discuss the plan with her, he said, before drawing it up, and in effect she had cogitated so much upon it that her ideas came forth with more than her usual fluency and sententiousness. The scheme was that an asylum should be opened under the superintendence of Mr. Mauleverer himself, in which young girls might be placed to learn handicrafts that might secure their livelihood, in especial, perhaps, wood engraving and printing. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible, in time, to render the whole self-supporting, suppose by the publication of a little illustrated periodical, the materials for which might be supplied by those interested in the institution.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{her fault}} {{if she did not}} overdo these history, but perhaps it was all true about the number of girls who were ready and willing to marry him. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> true, though she had no direct {{authority}} for saying it, that he had made up his mind never to marry, and that was the reason why he felt himself so safe in being the nicest sort of friend. He was safe, Miss Rasmith philosophized, but whether other people were so safe was a different question. There were girls who were said to be dying for him; but of course those things were always said about a handsome young minister. She had frankly taken him on his own ground, from the beginning, and she believed that this was what he liked. At any rate, they had agreed that they were never to be anything but the best of friends, and they always had been.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Tulliver, {{as we have}} seen, was {{not without}} {{influence}} over her husband. No woman is; she can always incline him to do either what she wishes, or the reverse; and on the composite impulses that were threatening to hurry Mr. Tulliver into [...] "law," [...] Mrs. Tulliver's monotonous pleading had doubtless its share of force; <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> comparable to that proverbial feather which has the credit or discredit of breaking the camel's back; though, on a strictly impartial view, the blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which had already placed the back in such imminent peril that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without mischief. Not that Mrs. Tulliver's feeble beseeching could have had this feather's weight in virtue of her single personality; but whenever she departed from entire assent to her husband, he saw in her {{the representative of the}} Dodson family; and it was a guiding principle with Mr. Tulliver to let the Dodsons know that they were not to domineer over him, or--more specifically--that a male Tulliver was far more than equal to four female Dodsons, even though one of them was Mrs. Glegg.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no doubt}} about it that Delora had disappeared. I {{followed}} the reception clerk downstairs myself within the space of a few minutes, and made the most careful inquiries in every part of the hotel. It did not take me very long to ascertain, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that he was not upon the premises, nor had he yet been seen by any one connected with the place. I even walked to the corner of the courtyard and looked aimlessly up and down the Strand. Within those few hundred yards which lay between where I was standing and Charing Cross something had happened which had prevented his reaching the hotel. It may have been the slightest of accidents. It might be something more serious. Or <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be,</b> I was forced to reflect, that he had never intended coming! Presently I returned to the suite of rooms upon the fifth floor to make my report to Miss Delora. I found her calmer than I had expected, but her face fell when I was forced to confess that I had heard no news.|$|E
60|$|Even in that {{uncertain}} light {{there was}} no mistaking the tall figure, the gaudily striped clinging gown and turbaned head. And then a strange revulsion of feeling, quite characteristic of the emotional side of his singular temperament, overcame him. He was taking leave of his wife--the dream of his youth--perhaps forever! It should be no parting in anger as at Robles; it should be with a tenderness that would blot out their past in their separate memories--God knows! <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> that a parting at that moment was a joining of them in eternity. In his momentary exaltation it even struck him that it was a duty, no less sacred, no less unselfish than the one to which he had devoted his life. The light was growing stronger; he could hear voices in the nearest picket line, and the sound of a cough in the invading mist. He made a hurried sign to the on-coming figure to follow him, ran ahead, and halted at last in the cover of a hackmatack bush. Still gazing forward over the marsh, he stealthily held out his hand behind him as the rustling skirt came nearer. At last his hand was touched--but even at that touch he started and turned quickly.|$|E

Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible to implement the second-best through trade. In addition, the paper highlights the use of randomness in setting incentives for efficient learning. The trade-offs among simultaneous and sequential learning and among efficient learning and efficient allocations are discussed.

40|$|The "Finale" in "Toilers of the Sea": Horizon and Limit of the Novelistic Text The word "end" was {{not written}} by Hugo {{at the end}} of "Toilers of the Sea"; this is because his ending, within the precise delimitations {{suggested}} here, does not need <b>it,</b> and <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> spoilt by the word.
