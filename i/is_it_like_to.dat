5|$|Two {{recordings}} of Bax as a pianist {{were made in}} 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and Mater ora Filium were recorded {{under the auspices of}} the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel, in 1928; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel, the Coronation March, the unaccompanied choral work What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> be Young and Fair? and the solo piano piece Paean.|$|E

Other commonly read modern philosophers to have studied at the university include A. J.

Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature.

500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Nagel first {{characterized}} {{the problem of}} qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a bat?". Nagel argued that even if we knew everything {{there was to know}} from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know {{what it is like to}} be a bat. However, others argue that qualia are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.|$|E
2500|$|In {{philosophy}} and certain models of psychology, qualia ( [...] or singular form: quale) are {{claimed to be}} individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective [...] (...) meaning [...] "of what sort" [...] or [...] "of what kind" [...] in a specific instance like [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> taste a specific orange, this particular orange now". Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, {{as well as the}} redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to [...] "propositional attitudes", where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what is it directly like to be experiencing.|$|E

2500|$|Although it {{does not}} {{actually}} mention the word [...] "qualia", Thomas Nagel's paper [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> Be a Bat?" [...] is often cited in debates over qualia. Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character, a what-it-is-like aspect. He states that [...] "an organism has conscious mental states {{if and only if}} there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism—something it is like for the organism." [...] Nagel also suggests that the subjective aspect of the mind may not ever be sufficiently accounted for by the objective methods of reductionistic science. He claims that [...] "if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done." [...] Furthermore, he states that [...] "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective." ...|$|E
