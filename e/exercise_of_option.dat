40|$|The {{exodus from}} Zone B of the FTT {{should be viewed}} {{in the context of}} the wider {{phenomenon}} of the exodus of the population of Venezia Giulia and Dalmatia. First then the article briefly describes the essential characteristics of the phenomenon of migration, starting from the evolution of the term "exodus" itself. At first this was a militant expression, used to emphasize the uniqueness of that historic experience, but gradually it turned into a general interpretative category, used by historians to refer to a special type of forced relocation taking place in Europe since the mid- 800, different from deportation and expulsions. The essay goes on to analyze the main forces that generated the exodus of almost all of the Italian population from the territories transferred after World War II under the control of Yugoslavia. The first was the revolution, at once political, social and national and its impact on society of Istria. Special attention is devoted to the policy of the "Slavic‑Italian brotherhood" as a strategy of selective integration, as well as to the operations undertaken by the "people’s authorities": in fact, the combination of the structural limitations of the policy of "brotherhood" and its failure, created an unbearable situation for Italians. Therefore, the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> rights became for them the only possible way out of the crisis. The hardness of living conditions - material and political - that existed in Istria forced also the exodus of part of the population of native Slovenian and Croatian, especially in rural areas. Similar processes also took place in Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste, even though there these processes lasted until as late as 1954 due to the uncertainty with regard to which state this territory would belong to. The author focuses mostly on the relations between the Italian population and the new authorities and touches upon certain topics of the most recent research. He also brings the attention to the still unfinished research with regard to the National Liberation Committee for Istria and radio station Radio Venezia Giulia. In both cases, the new acquisitions were made possible by the finding of significant archival collections. Finally he also focuses on the final stage of the Trieste question, concluded with the signature of the London Memorandum and followed by the emigration of almost all of the Italian population from Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste and settlement of exiles in the Trieste territory...|$|E

30|$|Proposition 4 {{illustrates}} that when asymmetry exists and demand is in area II equilibrium exercise will be sequential and instructive. With asymmetric information, the option exercise is (D, I); the more informed firm moves first and engages higher benefits {{from being a}} leader. The less informed firm selects to wait and free sit on the information expressed by the leader’s exercise. This permits the follower to conclude the leader’s individual information through noticed <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>options.</b> So, in this equilibrium, the leader gets payoff compensation and the follower gets informational benefits.|$|R

We specify the conditions under which debt has a signaling value and the debt contract that achieves it.

40|$|This paper extends Lucas (1978) to a {{production}} economy with two capital goods. It is an RBC {{model in which}} each unit of investment requires a new idea, an "option". When options are scarce, new capital is harder {{to put in place}} and the value of old capital rises. Thus the stock market and Tobin's Q are negative indexes of intangibles. During a boom, Q rises gradually, as options are used up. Because investment represents an <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>options,</b> it has an intertemporal substitution tradeoff that is absent in the adjustment-cost model. Equilibrium may be efficient even without markets for knowledge; the stock market may suffice. ...|$|R

The optimal executive price increases {{in the size of}} grant and base salary, and decreases in leverage and the riskiness of desired investment policy. Other things equal, the optimal <b>exercise</b> price <b>of</b> European <b>options</b> with longer maturity should increase more for an increase in base salary {{and the size of the}} grant, and decrease more for an increase in leverage than the one with shorter maturity.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{companies}} tend to switch auditors when audit opinions are inconsistent {{with those in}} the previous period, financial performances are worse, and both stock and option values fall. We find no evidence that during the switching year, option values and firm performance affect the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> executives' stock <b>options,</b> possibly because the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> stock <b>options</b> often occurs before switching auditors in order to prevent the SEC from investigating insider trading in the switching year. The changes in holdings <b>of</b> executives' stock <b>options</b> are positively correlated with the degree to which analysts' earnings forecasts deviate from previous periods; the announcements of analysts' earnings forecast errors have no influence on the value <b>of</b> executives' <b>options,</b> since that signaling effect has already reflected on the stock price.

40|$|Real estate {{development}} from raw land to completed structures is a multistage process. Given the current view of development as the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a real <b>option,</b> {{the question arises}} whether development should be modeled as a compound option. This paper tests the validity <b>of</b> the compound <b>option</b> characterization by determining whether builders start units for which they have permits and then complete units started consistent with the predictions <b>of</b> the real <b>options</b> model. To do so, I first identify a reduced form relationship between permits and starts and then between starts and completions. The parameters of this relationship indicate how well permits proxy for starts and starts for completions. Then, I determine whether controlling for this structural relationship, new information, and uncertainty in returns affect permit exercise and completion rates, as in the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> real <b>options.</b> I find that current and previous quarter permits forecast current single-family starts, while multifamily starts require more quarterly lags of permits. More than one and two year's worth of lagged starts numbers are needed to estimate current quarter completions for single- and multifamilys buildings, respectively. The principal result is that once building permits have been obtained, the development process proceeds to completion. While {{there is no evidence}} that completion is the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> an <b>option</b> embedded in a start, some aspects of permits are consistent with builders treating them as an option for starts. However, even if they do, given permits obtained, it takes large changes in market conditions to affect small changes in starts. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R
