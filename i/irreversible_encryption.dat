40|$|We {{describe}} a sample data encryption method and prototype system using RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology for anonymous biological samples and samples with pseudonyms. This method {{has been developed}} to improve sample logistics in high-throughput biological laboratories and large-scale biorepositories. An innovative hardware and software concept is presented which allows the (reversible and <b>irreversible)</b> <b>encryption</b> of sensitive sample data without the need of electronic connectivity. The technique allows complete or partial encryption of specific information blocks. This is useful for collaborative sample and data exchange between decentralized laboratories and biorepositories. Further possible uses include system-to-sample authentication or secure data access based on a four-eye principle...|$|E
40|$|When we need {{to match}} {{different}} files, we generally face the problem of preserving confidentiality and respecting private life, especially if the files come from various sources. This problem may, on some occasions, dramatically restrict the utilization of administrative data for social statistics and research. In order to overcome this problem, some organizations, statistical institutes and research centers use the Secured Matching technique. Secured Matching is performed by using anonymous matching keys. One way to proceed is by using a technique for the <b>irreversible</b> <b>encryption</b> of the identifiers. The identifying elements common to several files are transformed by the same encryption process, allowing the matching {{to be done in}} an anonymous way by using the encrypted identifiers, with no possible link to the original identifiers In the session, we will talk about the use of Secured Matching in France and describe some applications in epidemiology. We also show how these techniques of secured matching can be considered as a potential for innovation for official French statistics...|$|E
