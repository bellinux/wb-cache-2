5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (<b>Intake</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>sensor)</b> was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass Air Flow Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E

Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure <b>sensor.</b> The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine.

At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller).

Optimized kinetic process (OKP) technology is implemented to realize HCCI combustion in a {{port fuel injection}} gasoline engine. The combustion and emission characteristics are investigated with variation of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure. The results show that <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> has great influence on HCCI combustion characteristic. Increased <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> results in advance combustion phase, shorten combustion duration, and lower indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Increased EGR rate retards combustion start phase and prolongs combustion duration, while maximum pressure rising rate and NOx emission are reduced with increase of EGR rate. In the condition with constant fuel flow quantity, increased air pressure leads to retarded combustion phase and lower pressure rising rate, which will reduce the engine knocking tendency. In the condition with constant air fuel ratio condition, fuel injection quantity increases as <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure increases, which lead to high heat release rate and high emission level. The optimal <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> varies in different operating area, which can be tuned from ambient temperature to 220 ℃ by heat management system.

This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency.

40|$|Presently, the {{research}} on the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines has gained importance {{in the field of}} automotive power applications due to its superior efficiency and low emissions compared to the conventional internal combustion (IC) engines. In principle, the HCCI uses premixed lean homogeneous charge that auto-ignites volumetrically throughout the cylinder. The homogeneous mixture preparation is the main key to achieve high fuel economy and low exhaust emissions from the HCCI engines. In the recent past, different techniques to prepare homogeneous mixture have been explored. The major problem associated with the HCCI is to control the auto-ignition over wide range of engine operating conditions. The control strategies for the HCCI engines were also explored. This dissertation investigates the utilization of ethanol, a potential major contributor to the fuel economy of the future. Port fuel injection (PFI) strategy was used to prepare the homogeneous mixture external to the engine cylinder in a constant speed, single cylinder, four stroke air cooled engine which was operated on HCCI mode. Seven modules of work have been proposed and carried out in this research work to establish the results of using ethanol as a potential fuel in the HCCI engine. Ethanol has a low Cetane number and thus it cannot be auto-ignited easily. Therefore, <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> preheating was used to achieve auto-ignition temperatures. In the first module of work, the ethanol fueled HCCI engine was thermodynamically analysed to determine the operating domain. The minimum <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> requirement to achieve auto-ignition and stable HCCI combustion was found to be 130 °C. Whereas, the knock limit of the engine limited the maximum <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of 170 °C. Therefore, the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> range was fixed between 130 - 170 °C for the ethanol fueled HCCI operation. In the second module of work, experiments were conducted with the variation of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> from 130 - 170 °C at a regular interval of 10 °C.

40|$|Abstract: The startability {{of diesel}} engines degrades as the ambient {{temperature}} falls, in particular, to the borderline or lower temperature. The essential cause is {{the deterioration of}} in-cylinder combustion resulting from worsening of combustion conditions. A membrane-based oxygen-enriched <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> (OEA) method is proposed to improve in-cylinder combustion and then to reduce exhaust emissions during the start-up process. This paper investigates the effects of OEA on startability and exhaust emission behaviour during the engine start-up. The experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine. A membrane-based oxygen-enrichment system was constructed to supply the test engine with <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> containing 21 vol %, 23 vol %, 25 vol %, and 27 vol % oxygen respectively. The in-cylinder pressure, instantaneous engine speed, and time-resolved engine-out emissions were recorded and com-pared for the OEA and the baseline methods (ambient air (AA), 21 vol % oxygen). The results show that, at the high <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> (26 °C), the engine could start smoothly. When the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> fell to the borderline temperature (5 °C), the startability significantly degraded, in-cylinder incomplete combustion was evident during the initial stage of start-up, and the start-up time increased. With OEA at 5 °C, the startability was markedly improved, and the engine experienced fewer cycles than those at the same <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> with AA before it reached idle operation.
