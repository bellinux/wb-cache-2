At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.|$|E

500|$|After {{taking a}} 3–0 lead {{against one of}} the league’s better teams on a Dave Green field goal, the Buccaneers were {{overwhelmed}} by the Baltimore Colts in a disastrous second quarter. A Danny Reece interception of a Bert Jones pass was called back due to a roughing-the-passer penalty, and another was dropped by Richard Wood. Cornerback Mike Washington was thrown out of the game for fighting. Cal Peterson and Lee Roy Selmon went out with knee injuries. Film of the game appeared to indicate that the injury to Selmon was intentional. The Colts followed with 9 points in each of the next two quarters. The Buccaneers finally scored their first two touchdowns of the year, a fumble return by Danny Reece and a 1-yard Charlie Davis run. The Colts set team records with eight sacks, and with 124 penalty yards. They outgained Tampa Bay 458 yards to 89 and 31 first downs to 6. The Buccaneers were only able to complete four passes; wide receiver Lee McGriff was their leading passer with a 39-yard completion. Said McKay afterward, “Field position <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> badly, dropped passes <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> badly, no blocking <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> badly, injuries <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> badly, and penalties <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> badly. Otherwise, it was a perfect afternoon." ...|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Muhammad {{has long}} been {{featured}} {{as one of the}} many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, [...] "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might <b>hurt</b> <b>us.</b> Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't <b>hurt</b> <b>us,</b> but we won't rip on [...] because they might hurt us.'" [...] The Muhammad subplot in [...] "200", like the [...] "Cartoon Wars" [...] episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. [...] "200" [...] also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.|$|E
500|$|The Florida State {{defense was}} {{considered}} key to reining in Tech quarterback Vick. The Seminoles allowed less than 100rushing {{yards per game}} on average, and intercepted 22passes during the regular season. The Seminoles were ranked 15th nationally in pass defense {{at the end of}} the regular season but had allowed increasing amounts of pass yardage in the latter games of the season. Despite that fact, the Florida State defense's main concern was Michael Vick's ability to run the football. Said Florida State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews: [...] "A guy like that usually gives us problems, considering the type of (43 gap) defense we run. When a quarterback gets out of the pocket, that could <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> for big yardage." ...|$|E

Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain was a {{supporter}} of the Euromaidan protests against the elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to <b>hurt</b> <b>us.</b> But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." [...] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.|$|E
500|$|In January 2001, a United States {{federal appeals}} court upheld the {{dismissal}} of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be [...] "intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources." [...] In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had [...] "committed improper acts" [...] in the past, but also claimed that: [...] "allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, {{the result of the}} misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they [...] "provide a safe harbor for biased journalism". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: [...] "It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> all.

I only heard him complain once to my mother, 'Haven't the KMT <b>hurt</b> <b>us</b> enough?'"

2500|$|Susan Griffin {{was one of}} {{the first}} feminists to write on pornography's {{implications}} in her 1981 Pornography and Silence. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, [...] "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual." [...] She explained sexual harassment by saying that it [...] "doesn't mean that they all want to fuck us, they just want to <b>hurt</b> <b>us,</b> dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us." [...] Some see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.|$|E
