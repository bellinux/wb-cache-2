25|$|The {{strategy}} {{of building a}} business around posting free comics online began in the 1980s, when Eric Millikin created the first webcomic, Witches and Stitches for CompuServe in 1985. Self-publishing on the internet allowed Millikin to avoid censorship and the demographic constraints of mass-market print publishers. Millikin's comics were instantly popular with the early internet audience around the world, inspiring other comics artists to follow. However, at that time a large online audience and influence did not necessarily translate into enough sales to reach economic success. By the 1990s, Millikin had moved to publishing comics on the then-new World Wide Web, but was homeless, living in a car, and working in an anatomy lab as an <b>embalmer</b> and dissectionist of human cadavers. Since then, Millikin has achieved professional webcomic success, including through turning his webcomics into award-winning print-published work and commissioned public art, and by selling original artwork in gallery exhibitions. By 1999, Millikin {{was one of the}} few, and first, webcomic creators successful enough to make a living as an artist. He now often donates a portion of his profits to charities.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an <b>embalmer.</b>|$|E

In what is now Chile however, the Chinchoro peoples {{are known to have}} been <b>embalming</b> and mummifying their dead since around 5000 BC. The terms mummification and <b>embalming</b> are interchangeable. <b>Embalming</b> is using {{preservatives}} to prevent decay of the body. Many other Native American peoples further perfected the art of <b>embalming</b> and mummification including the skilled Moche peoples in present-day Peru.|$|R

500|$|William {{was born}} in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Normandy, most likely {{towards the end of}} 1028. [...] He was the only son of Robert I, Duke of Normandy, son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. [...] His mother, Herleva, was the {{daughter}} of Fulbert of Falaise; Fulbert may have been a tanner or <b>embalmer.</b> She was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert. Instead, she later married Herluin de Conteville, with whom she had two sons– Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain– and a daughter whose name is unknown. One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority. [...] Robert also had a daughter, Adelaide of Normandy, by another mistress.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Steiger {{played an}} effeminate <b>embalmer</b> in Tony Richardson's comedy The Loved One, about the funeral {{business}} in Los Angeles, {{based on the}} 1948 short satirical novel by Evelyn Waugh. His curly-haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of Apollo he once saw while meeting Richardson. Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who found his character repellent. His next role, as Komarovsky, a Russian politician and [...] "villainous opportunist" [...] who rapes Julie Christie's character in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), {{was one of his}} favorites. Steiger, one of only two Americans in the cast, was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness, and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American. The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s, grossing $200 million worldwide. It has since been acclaimed {{as one of the greatest}} films ever made, and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list by the American Film Institute.|$|E
50|$|A rather {{different}} process {{is used for}} cadavers <b>embalmed</b> for dissection by medical professionals, students and researchers. Here, the first priority is for long term preservation, not presentation. As such, medical embalmers use <b>embalming</b> fluids that contain concentrated formaldehyde (37-40%, known as formalin) or gluteraldehyde as well as phenol and are made without dyes or perfumes. Many <b>embalming</b> chemical companies make specialized anatomical <b>embalming</b> fluids.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the risks}} to prosectors are low. Cadavers used for {{teaching}} purposes are <b>embalmed</b> before they are encountered by a prosector and students. <b>Embalming</b> fluid usually contains formaldehyde, phenol, Dettol, and glycerine which disinfect and kill pathogens within the cadaver. With exposure to <b>embalming</b> fluid, tissues and bodily fluids, such as blood, become fixed. Prosectors and students working with <b>embalmed</b> cadavers must always wear protective gloves, however this is more for protection against the harsh chemicals used in <b>embalming</b> such as formaldehyde and dettol which can cause moderate to severe skin irritation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Embalming</b> {{caught on}} in the United States during the American Civil War, {{as a result of}} sentimental issues {{involving}} foreign officials and servicemen dying far from home, and the need for their remains to be returned home for local burial. This period starting at about 1861 is known as the Funeral period of <b>embalming</b> and is marked by a separation of the fields of <b>embalming</b> by funeral directors and <b>embalming</b> for medical and scientific purposes. Dr. Thomas Holmes received a commission from the Army Medical Corps to <b>embalm</b> the corpses of dead Union officers to return to their families. Military authorities also permitted private embalmers to work in military-controlled areas. The passage of Abraham Lincoln's body home for burial was made possible by <b>embalming,</b> and it brought the possibilities and potential of <b>embalming</b> to a wider public notice.|$|R

50|$|Diana, Princess of Wales was <b>embalmed</b> {{shortly after}} her death in France in August 1997.

2500|$|Harry Maione and Frank Abbandando {{were the}} first members of the Brooklyn [...] "Combination" [...] {{to be put on}} trial for murder. In May 1940, the trial started for the May 25, 1937 ice-pick murder of George [...] "Whitey" [...] Rudnick in a Brooklyn parking garage. Harry Strauss was also indicted for the murder, and, after {{initially}} agreeing to cooperate with the District Attorney's office, he was severed from the trial. On May 15, 1940, Abe Reles testified that Rudnick was marked for death after Strauss claimed he had obtained information that Rudnick was a [...] "stool pigeon for the police." [...] Reles also testified that he waited outside the garage while Maione, Abbandando and Strauss were inside with Rudnick. After Rudnick was believed to have been murdered, Abbandando called for Reles and summoned Angelo [...] "Julie" [...] Catalano to the garage to assist with moving the body. Since Rudnick was still alive, Strauss resumed his assault with an ice pick, and Maione used a meat cleaver to complete the murder. The next day, Catalano, who drove the automobile with Rudnick's body, corroborated Reles' account of the murder. [...] "Dukey" [...] Maffetore and Abe [...] "Pretty" [...] Levine testified that they stole the automobile that was used to dispose of the body. Maione and 14 witnesses testified that he was at his grandmother's wake when Rudnick was murdered. The funeral home undertaker and <b>embalmer</b> testified that Maione was not at the wake. Also, one of Maione's chief witnesses admitted that he committed perjury as ordered by Maione's brother, whom he feared. On May 23, 1940, Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder, which meant a mandatory sentence of death in the electric chair. New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned the conviction on a 4–3 vote in December 1940. The second trial started on March 10, 1941. At one point during the trial, Maione lost his temper and threw a glass of water at Reles. Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder for a second time on April 3, 1941. Maione and Abbandando were formally sentenced to death for a second time on April 14, 1941. The Court of Appeals upheld the second conviction on January 8, 1942. Maione and Abbandando were executed at Sing Sing prison on February 19, 1942.|$|E

50|$|Various {{communist}} {{leaders have}} been <b>embalmed</b> and put on public display. Perhaps the most famous <b>embalmed</b> body of the 20th century is that of Vladimir Lenin, which continues to draw crowds decades {{after his death in}} 1924, and is seen in his Moscow mausoleum. Joseph Stalin was also <b>embalmed</b> and placed next to Lenin, but his body was buried in 1961 during de-Stalinization. Klement Gottwald of Czechoslovakia, who died just five days after attending Stalin's funeral, was <b>embalmed</b> and displayed in a mausoleum at National Monument in Vitkov in Prague. However, in 1962 due to a botched <b>embalming,</b> the body was decomposing, and was removed and cremated. Bulgarian Georgi Dimitrov was <b>embalmed</b> and placed on display in the Sofia Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum. After the fall of Communism in Bulgaria, his body was buried in 1990 in the Central cemetery of Sofia. Mongolia's Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Angola's Agostinho Neto and Guyana's Forbes Burnham were also <b>embalmed</b> by the same Russian team. Currently, <b>embalmed</b> communist leaders can also be found in the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun for Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.|$|R

50|$|<b>Embalming</b> {{is the art}} {{and science}} of {{preserving}} human remains by treating them (in its modern form with chemicals) to forestall decomposition. The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. The three goals of <b>embalming</b> are sanitization, presentation, and preservation (or restoration). <b>Embalming</b> has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the <b>embalming</b> processes a greater religious meaning.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For decades, <b>embalmed</b> cadavers {{have played}} an {{important}} role in teaching anatomy to the scientists and doctors of the future. Most anatomy departments use a traditional formaldehyde-based <b>embalming</b> method, but formalin <b>embalming</b> makes the bodies very rigid, which limits their usefulness for procedures other than dissec-tion. A more recent <b>embalming</b> method developed by W. Thiel has allowed these ‘‘silent teachers’’ to take on a further role in applied anatomy research and teaching: to act as models for surgical training and medical research...|$|R

40|$|Cadavers are {{typically}} <b>embalmed</b> using fluids containing varying concentrations of alcohols, phenols, and glutaraldehydes in water {{to preserve the}} tissue and kill bacteria. Occasionally cadavers in gross anatomy studies become infested with mold growth. The primary goal of our research is to compare the effectiveness of <b>embalming</b> fluids at different concentrations {{in the prevention of}} the growth of mold on cadavers. Previous studies in our lab determined the optimal preparatory procedures for eight common <b>embalming</b> fluids. We selected four formulas to test their ability to retard the growth of Aspergellus flavus a common species of mold recovered from cadaver tissue. <b>Embalming</b> fluids diluted with water are significantly less effective in the prevention of Aspergellus flavus growth than <b>embalming</b> fluids consisting of a higher ratio of alcohol or preservatives to water. We were able to determine that a dilution ratio of 1 : 32 or higher would not retard mold growth. Mold cultures maintained for more than 120 days in diluted <b>embalming</b> fluids were still viable suggesting the need for proper preparation and storage of <b>embalming</b> fluids...|$|R
