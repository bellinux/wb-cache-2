40|$|Long term {{projects}} like the Idaho Bird Observatory’s Lucky Peak banding station provide valuable information on bird conservation and life history traits. We explored banding data from 1997 - 2009 to examine yearly patterns of abundance and survivorship for the 10 most common breeding species. We found that survivorship patterns vary by species. We documented Nashville and Yellow warblers {{living up to}} 4 years, while some <b>Dusky</b> <b>Flycatchers,</b> MacGillivray’s Warblers and Chipping Sparrows lived 7 years or more. In fact several Western Tanagers and <b>Dusky</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> exceed or match longevity records in the USGS Bird Banding Lab database. The ratio of hatch year birds (hatched that spring) to adults lends insight into survivorship, productivity and recruitment in the community. Species may have low numbers of hatch years one year yet high numbers of second year birds (hatched the previous spring) the next year. This was particularly seen in Warbling Vireos and suggests that immigration is important for this species. In contrast, the number of hatch year Spotted Towhees in one year correlated {{with the number of}} second years in the next year, implying that many towhees hatched at the site return to breed. Analysis also showed trends in population dynamics and striking annual difference in species’ abundance. Neotropical migrants like MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s and Yellow warblers peaked in both 2000 / 01 and 2006 / 07 but Nashville Warblers (another Neotropical species) peaked in 2005. Interestingly, short distant migrants such as Chipping Sparrow and Spotted Towhee also peaked in 2005. Further investigation is required to determine which factors—possibly including weather, diet, timing of breeding and migration strategy—contribute to these fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{declines in}} avian clutch size are well documented, but {{seasonal}} variation in other reproductive parameters has received less attention. For example, {{the probability of}} complete brood mortality typically explains much {{of the variation in}} reproductive success and often varies seasonally, but we know little about the underlying cause of that variation. This oversight is surprising given that nest predation influences many other life-history traits and varies throughout the breeding season in many songbirds. To determine the underlying causes of observed seasonal decreases in risk of nest predation, we modeled nest predation of <b>Dusky</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (Empidonax oberholseri) in northern California as a function of foliage phenology, energetic demand, developmental stage, conspecific nest density, food availability for nest predators, and nest predator abundance. Seasonal variation in the risk of nest predation was not associated with seasonal changes in energetic demand, conspecific nest density, or predator abundance. Instead, seasonal variation in the risk of nest predation was associated with foliage density (early, but not late, in the breeding season) and seasonal changes in food available to nest predators. Supplemental food provided to nest predators resulted in a numerical response by nest predators, increasing the risk of nest predation at nests that were near supplemental feeders. Our results suggest that seasonal changes in foliage density and factors associated with changes in food availability for nest predators are important drivers of temporal pattern...|$|R
