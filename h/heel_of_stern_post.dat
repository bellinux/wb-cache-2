2500|$|A further {{problem is}} that {{especially}} wooden ships {{have more than one}} [...] "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the [...] "length of the topmost deck" [...] – the [...] "length on deck" [...] (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge <b>of</b> <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> on deck level' or the [...] "length between perpendiculars" [...] (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge <b>of</b> <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including jibboom and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The largest length for comparing ships, the total [...] "overall" [...] length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.|$|R

60|$|But we are {{not done}} with that engine yet. The engine is powerful. We are two small men and a small woman. It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.

And by the time all this is settled, we {{redistribute}} the allotments of space to the engine-room, galley, bath-room, state-rooms, and cabin, and begin all over again. And when we have shifted the engine, I send off a telegram of gibberish to its makers at New York, something like this: Toggle-joint abandoned change thrust-bearing accordingly distance from forward side of flywheel to face <b>of</b> <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> sixteen feet six inches.|$|R
50|$|Congress {{appropriated}} $45,000 to tow Kearsarge home, but a salvage {{team of the}} Boston Towboat Company {{found that}} she could not be refloated. Some artifacts were saved from the ship, including the ship's Bible. The salvaged items, along with a damaged section <b>of</b> her <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> with an unexploded shell from CSS Alabama still embedded in it, are now stored or on display at the Washington Navy Yard.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, {{approximately}} 1/3 of {{the wreck}} was fully excavated. Part of the hull of the ship, including much of the keel and part <b>of</b> the <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> have survived. The 1500 lb. sternpost was recovered in November 2007. The North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources set up the website Queen Anne's Revenge to build on intense public interest in the finds. Artifacts recovered in 2008 include loose ceramic and pewter fragments, lead strainer fragments, a nesting weight, cannon apron, ballast stones, a sword guard and a coin.|$|R
25|$|Dufferin was 108.0 ft (length from {{fore part}} of stem, under the bowsprit, to the aft {{side of the}} head <b>of</b> the <b>stern</b> <b>post),</b> 25.0 ft (main breadth to outside of plating), 8.6 ft (depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling at midships), and 28.0 ft (length of engine room). Dufferin had a gross tonnage of 210.57 and a {{registered}} tonnage of 98.93. She was equipped with a Scottish compound surface condensing engine 0.20 Cylinder. 15” & 32” – 24” 42 N.H.P. (nominal horsepower). Additionally, Dufferin had two masts with auxiliary schooner rigging to supplement the steam engine. Furthermore, she had wooden framework with a carvel build, and a elliptical stern.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of Martin-Baker designs was the simple but efficient installation of main systems. The clean and orderly cockpit was set well back, allowing a good view downwards behind the wing. A crash post was fitted, which automatically extended to minimise structure damage and injury to the pilot {{in the event of a}} nose-over landing. A small, tapered tailplane was mounted on the top of the fuselage well forward <b>of</b> the <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> while the fin and rudder combination was roughly triangular in side elevation. This arrangement placed most of the effective rudder area below the tailplane, thus providing an adequate balance to the keel surface and assuring good recovery from spins. In initial MB2 configurations, there was no fin and the rudder was mounted on the fuselage but lateral stability was unsatisfactory, with the fixed fin added later.|$|R
50|$|The Henrietta Marie wreck {{has yielded}} more than 7000 objects (and more than 30,000 glass beads), the largest {{collection}} of artifacts known from a slave ship. They have contributed greatly {{to our understanding of}} slave ships and the slave trade. Parts making up more than 80 bilboes have been found at the wreck site. As bilboes were typically used to shackle pairs of slaves together, the ones found at the wreck site could have restrained more than 160 slaves. Other items found at the wreck site include trade goods apparently left over from trading for captives in Africa, goods acquired in Africa in addition to captives (including an elephant tusk), and gear belonging to the ship and crew. Part of the hull of the ship, including much of the keel and part <b>of</b> the <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> have survived, and have been measured and reburied at the site.|$|R
50|$|Moore {{has worked}} as a {{maritime}} archaeologist exploring a shipwreck believed {{to be part of the}} 1622 Spanish treasure fleet sunk near the Dry Tortugas. The wreck, located in 1332' (406m) of water, yielded olive jars, copper, gold, silver, glass and other cultural artifacts. He also served as project archaeologist for the team that excavated the wreck of the slave ship, the Henrietta Marie. The Henrietta Marie wreck has yielded more than 7000 objects (and more than 30,000 glass beads), the largest collection of artifacts known from a slave ship. Parts making up more than 80 bilboes, which were typically used to shackle pairs of slaves together, have been found at the wreck site.

25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward <b>of</b> the <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|R
50|$|The torpedo-laying {{machinery}} {{was designed}} by Captain Wood, and constructed by the Clute Brothers, of Schenectady, NY. The general appearance of the vessel is shown by the side elevation and plan, Figs. 1 and 4, while in Figs. 2 and 3 are given, respectively, a longitudinal section and sectional plan, which show clearly {{the arrangement of the}} torpedo machinery. The length of the vessel over all is 84 ft 2 in (25.7 m), and her length from the after edge <b>of</b> her <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> to the forward edge of the gate frame is 73 ft 11 in (22.5 m), while her breadth was 20 ft 8 in (6.3 m). The depth of her hold is 9 ft 11½ in (3.04 m), and her draft when launched with 10 tons of torpedo machinery and 2½ tons of her propelling engines on board was 4 ft. When fully equipped, this draft was increased to 7 ft 5½ in (2.27 m), and, by pumping water into compartments provided for the purpose, as will be explained presently, this draft can be increased to 9 ft 1 in (2.8 m) when the vessel is going into action. At this latter draft the water is about level with the gunwale, but, owing to the arched form of the deck, the vessel has still under such circumstances 207 tons of displacement.|$|R

50|$|The Treasure Ships were {{recorded}} {{to have a}} size of 44 zhang, 4 chi, i.e. 444 chi. This was no coincidence. There are four cardinal directions, four seasons, and four virtues. The number four was an auspicious association for treasure ships Some of the drydocks at Longjiang were 27 to 36 m (90 to 120 feet) wide, but two were 64 m (210 feet) wide, which {{is big enough to}} build a 50 m (166-foot) wide ship. Compared with other ships, treasure ships were wide in ratio to their length as typical with fuchuan warships. As a result, they achieved stability created by the V-shaped hull, the long keel, and the heavy ballast. The keel consisted of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, holes in the prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off the sides of the ship in order to increase stability.

50|$|Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, {{the hull}} was of {{composite}} construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking.

50|$|The {{foresail}} {{was set on}} {{the port}} side of the Topan and the mainsail on the starboard side of the Agung. A relatively small jib was set on the very long bowsprit. All pinas, even the big ones of 80 feet and above were steered by a tiller with a pully block system easing the strain on a conventional rudder hinged on the <b>stern</b> <b>post.</b> This tiller was operated from within a round cabin (cup) placed on the <b>stern</b> <b>of</b> the boat. This cabin was housing the accommodation of the crew as well. The hold was reserved for the cargo.|$|R
50|$|The weakest {{part of an}} {{enlarged}} hulk would be its stem and stern. Since it has no proper keel or substantial stem or <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> those parts <b>of</b> the boat {{would have to be}} reinforced by the introduction of substantial aprons and breasthooks, perhaps augmented by sacrificial stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> between which the unsupported hull planking could be sandwiched. Early hulks, like all of the other northern boat types, were initially shell-built using lapstrake or clinker planking which was subsequently reinforced by the insertion of grown crooks of timber as frames. Using these techniques, perhaps better understood as a result of technological transfers from architectural woodworking, shipwrights were able to extend the hulk in size until it rivaled and surpassed the cog.|$|R
5|$|The Texas Antiquities Committee {{sponsored}} a travelling {{exhibition of the}} finds from the 1554 wreck from 1977 to 1981, which visited 20 museums across Texas.

5000|$|On 10 May 1862, off Fort Pillow, General Price under First Officer J. E.

This allowed General Price to violently ram the Federal gunboat, taking away her rudder, <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> and a large piece <b>of</b> her <b>stern,</b> decisively disabling her. At the same time General Prices well directed fire silenced Federal Mortar boat No. 16, which was being guarded by Cincinnati. General Price was heavily hit in this action.

50|$|The two deck steamer {{was laid}} down in July 1917 by the National Shipbuilding Company of Orange, Texas as Hull No. 245. Shortages of {{materials}} meant that she was wooden-hulled, with a steel keelson, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> <b>of</b> oak, and timbers largely of yellow pine. This was due to shortages of metals. SS Argenta was launched in May 1919.|$|R
50|$|The {{sides of}} the Delaware River Durhams were {{vertical}} with a slight curvature to meet a similar curvature of the bottom which was otherwise flat.

50|$|The hulk (OE:hulc) {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century, when it is distinguished from a keel (OE:ceol), a ship in keeled longship tradition such as the knarr.

Early images of hulks show them strongly curved upwards at stem and stern.|$|R
5000|$|Sparrow was {{launched}} on 26 September 1889 at Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Greenock. [...] Her triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine {{was built by}} the Greenock Foundry, and developed 1,200 indicated horsepower, sufficient to propel her at 13 kn through her single screw. Her hull was of composite construction, that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. She was rigged as a barquentine.|$|R
5000|$|The Redbreast {{class were}} {{designed}} by Sir William Henry White, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction in 1888. [...] The hull was of composite construction, that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. These were the last class of composite-hulled gunboats built for the Royal Navy - the next class of gunboat, the Bramble-class gunboat of 1898, was of steel construction.|$|R
50|$|The Bramble {{class was}} {{designed}} by William White. The ships were of composite construction, meaning that the iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> were <b>of</b> iron, while the hull was planked with timber. This {{had the advantage of}} allowing the vessels to be coppered, thus keeping marine growth under control, a problem that caused iron-hulled ships to be frequently docked. They were 165 ft in length and displaced 715 tons.|$|R
