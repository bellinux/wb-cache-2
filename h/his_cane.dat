5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with <b>his</b> <b>cane</b> gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping <b>his</b> <b>cane.</b> At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with <b>his</b> <b>cane,</b> crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E

25|$|On January 30, 1835, what is {{believed}} to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with <b>his</b> <b>cane.</b> Others present, including DavyCrockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} attempt occurred on , while Nicholas {{was returning to}} Kyoto after a day trip to Lake Biwa in Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture. He was attacked by Tsuda Sanzō (1855–1891), one of his escorting policemen, who swung at the Tsesarevich's face with a sabre. The quick action of Nicholas's cousin, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who parried the second blow with <b>his</b> <b>cane,</b> saved his life. Tsuda then attempted to flee, but two rickshaw drivers in Nicholas's entourage chased him down and pulled him to the ground. Nicholas was left with a 9 centimeter long scar {{on the right side}} of his forehead, but his wound was not life-threatening.|$|E

When Licavoli was arrested at his home, police confiscated <b>his</b> <b>cane</b> with a long hidden blade in it and $3,000 in his underwear drawer. In 1982, Licavoli was tried and convicted of federal RICO charges and sentenced to seventeen years imprisonment.|$|E

Fleury wrote to Washington that all the guns were dismounted except two but that the soldiers of the garrison were able {{to repair the damage}} to the palisades every night. The only safe place in the fort was a ditch on the east side and Fleury would go there to round up men for work details, lashing out at the laggards with <b>his</b> <b>cane.</b> The next in command after Smith was Lieutenant Colonel Giles Russell of Connecticut, but he declined and asked to be recalled.

As US troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to put down their weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by US military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official note from the US Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where nothing could be done to save him.” He died a half-hour later.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, Congressman Rust became drew public {{attention}} {{for his efforts}} to oppose Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, who appeared likely to become Speaker of the House. Banks opposed further extension of slave territory, unlike Rust and his constituents. According to the Rust family history, Rust introduced something labeled a compromise resolution, which New York Tribune newspaperman Horace Greeley characterized Rust’s {{as an attempt to}} make it appear that the contest over the speakership was about personal rivalries among the candidates and not about principles. Greeley believed its true purpose was to oppose Banks's candidacy. After Congress adjourned, on the day The Tribune reached Washington, Rust accosted Greeley on the Capitol grounds and felled him with <b>his</b> <b>cane.</b> A few days later, Rust again struck Greeley again on the streets of Washington.|$|E

When President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring. Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with <b>his</b> <b>cane,</b> prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|A wand is {{a wooden}} stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus {{increase}} its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands {{are used as}} both tools and weapons in the wizarding world. They are thus {{an important aspect of}} nearly all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in <b>his</b> <b>cane.</b> In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are snapped in half. This type of damage to a wand is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, {{with the help of the}} powerful Elder Wand.|$|E
