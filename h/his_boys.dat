25|$|Bosco and his oratory {{moved around}} {{town for a}} number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession.

A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with <b>his</b> <b>boys</b> were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, Harvard University-educated {{physician}} and Boston Brahmin George Cheyne Shattuck, {{inspired by the}} educational theories of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, turned his country home in the hamlet of Millville, New Hampshire into a school for boys. Shattuck wanted <b>his</b> <b>boys</b> educated in the austere, bucolic countryside. A newly appointed board of trustees chose Henry Coit, a 24-year-old clergyman, to preside over the school for its first 39 years. In addition to Shattuck's two boys and Coit and his wife there was one other student. The original location was 50 acres, {{but over the years}} surrounding lands were acquired.|$|E

Accordingly, accompanied by his father, Dominic met John Bosco on the first Monday {{in the month of}} October, 1854. John Bosco records this conversation in some detail. He notes that Dominic was eager to go to Turin with John Bosco, and that he wished to become a priest after completing his studies in that town. This meeting was the beginning of their relationship, the result of which was that John Bosco agreed to take Dominic to Turin with him.|$|E
25|$|Penn {{was born}} in Hawaii to Jay Dee Penn, an Irish-American, and Loraine Shin, a Korean-American. At the age of 17, Penn began {{training}} in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being introduced to it by his neighbor, Tom Callos. Callos had put up fliers in local gyms looking for people to train with, and B.J.'s father Jay Dee Penn had called Callos and said <b>his</b> <b>boys</b> were interested. Callos then taught B.J. and his brother what he knew. Shortly thereafter, B.J. moved to San Jose, California to begin training at the Ralph Gracie BJJ academy with Dave Camarillo, who he lived with and became close friends with. It was here during his time in San Jose {{that he decided to}} pursue a career in martial arts (albeit not mixed martial arts at the time).|$|E
25|$|In 1991, with <b>his</b> <b>boys</b> {{grown and}} his wife {{spending}} six months of each year in Israel, Hambro moved to Florida {{to be close to}} his sister and other relatives, renting a Las Vistas apartment near the Inverrary Country Club in Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderhill). He taught private lessons, played in a variety of bands, both big and small, in Miami-Fort Lauderdale area jazz clubs, and continued to work as a booking agent. He also continued to readily donate his talents to charity fund raisers, most notably working with Jack Simpson to benefit the Brevard County Food Bank. However, suffering from severe chest pains, and told that he would need bypass surgery and a heart valve replacement, Hambro returned to New Jersey in early 1995 to be close to his sons, his wife, and the doctors with whom he was comfortable; and to work on Chico O'Farrill's comeback album.|$|E

25|$|The {{group had}} a regular spot on KTAT-AM, but {{frequently}} performed in Waco, where Brower met Jeff Knight, a breakdown fiddle player with whom he became good friends. Brower married Knight's daughter, Sybil, on March 23, 1937. After Brown's death in 1936, Brower joined the staff of WRR-AM in Dallas, where he worked for $14 a week, and played dances with Roy Newman and <b>His</b> <b>Boys.</b> In October 1936, Brower recorded with Bill Boyd and His Cowboy Ramblers in San Antonio; and in June 1937 with Bob Dunn. That same week he made his only recording with Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys. He then toured with bandleader Ted Fio Rito's orchestra until returning to Texas in 1939, {{when he joined the}} Light Crust Doughboys. Brower, replacing Buck Buchanan as fiddler in the string section but playing lead (Buchanan had played harmony), was also reunited with Kenneth Pitts. The group enjoyed great popularity, and by the 1940s was heard over 170 radio stations in the South and Southwest.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved <b>his</b> <b>boys,</b> and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E
500|$|Bryant Gumbel on his HBO Real Sports show in October likened Stern's role in {{the lockout}} to a [...] "modern {{plantation}} overseer, treating NBA men {{as if they were}} <b>his</b> <b>boys</b> ... keeping the hired hands in their place". The NBA owners are predominantly white, while the players are mostly black. ESPN noted that William C. Rhoden in his book $40 Million Slaves had earlier dealt with the topic of players as [...] "slaves" [...] in spite of earning millions of dollars. Stern dismissed Gumbel's comments as [...] "an occupational hazard" [...] of being the NBA commissioner. In early November, NBPA attorney Jeff Kessler criticized the owners' [...] "take it or leave it" [...] bargaining approach: [...] "instead of treating the players like partners, they're treating them like plantation workers." [...] Hall of Famer Magic Johnson called the comments [...] "ridiculous" [...] and defended Stern's record of promoting blacks. ESPN The Magazine said that the NBPA did not condone Kessler's statements, and they had intentionally avoided getting involved with Gumbel's earlier remarks. Kessler later apologized for his comments.|$|E

500|$|In a fight sequence, Anniyan {{encounters}} about {{a hundred}} martial artists inside the fictional International Martial Arts School, Vodao. The stunt scene was shot at the JJ Indoor Stadium in Chennai {{over a period of}} 25 days. Peter Hein, the stunt choreographer, is a native of Vietnam. 127 professionally trained fighters were brought in from Vietnam for the shoot. During the rehearsals, the rope, to which the stuntmen were tied and hung upside down, gave in. About a dozen stuntmen crashed down from the balcony, injuring themselves badly. The action sequence was shot using 120 cameras for employing the time slice photography technique, a visual effect known as [...] "bullet time" [...] and popularised by the American film The Matrix (1999), to achieve the frozen-time effect. Shankar had earlier {{toyed with the idea of}} time-slice and tried it while filming the song [...] "Ale Ale" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>Boys.</b> While the time-freeze sequence in Boys was achieved by the linking of 60–62 cameras to attain a 180° rotation, Anniyan employed 120–122 cameras for a 270° rotation.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{refer to}} a {{military}} hierarchy, but in contrary Scouting has an anti-authoritarian streak. The Patrol leader is a leader, but should originally be elected {{by members of the}} patrol. About the Scoutmaster Baden-Powell [...] "stipulated that the position of Scoutmaster was to be neither that of a schoolmaster nor of a commander Officer, but rather that of an elder brother among <b>his</b> <b>boys,</b> not detached or above them individually". These are no military hierarchy.|$|E
