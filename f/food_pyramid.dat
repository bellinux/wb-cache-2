25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which feed off the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form {{the base of the}} <b>food</b> <b>pyramid</b> that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF KATHRYN E. LAMB, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Food and Nutrition, {{presented}} on Tuesday, November 22, 2011, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale TITLE: DEVELOPMENT OF <b>FOOD</b> GUIDE <b>PYRAMID</b> FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ACHONDROPLASIA MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Sara Long Roth Previous studies have developed <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramids</b> for different populations. However, no study {{has developed a}} <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramid</b> for individuals with achondroplasia. This study used the USDA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramid,</b> RDA/DRI, and 2010 Dietary Guidelines to develop a <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramid</b> for individuals with achondroplasia. Although <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramids</b> for different populations exist, {{there was a lack}} of nutritional guidelines geared towards individuals with achondroplasia. As this population continues to increase (1 of 26, 000), the need for nutrition information increases too. Individuals with ACH are at risk of being overweight or obese just like average sized adults; and with being the height of a child and age of an adult, it can be more of a challenge to maintain a healthy body weight. This indicates how much of a need there is for <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramid</b> for individuals with achondroplasia. Results will benefit individuals with achondroplasia along with parents, physicians, registered dietitians, and other health professionals associated with individuals with achondroplasia. Development of <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramid</b> for individuals with ACH could help develop <b>food</b> guide <b>pyramids</b> for other types of dwarfisms...|$|R

40|$|Most American diets do {{not meet}} Federal <b>Food</b> Guide <b>Pyramid</b> dietary recommendations. On average, people consume too many servings of added fats and sugars and too few servings of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, lean meats, and foods made from whole grains {{compared}} with a reference set of <b>Food</b> Guide <b>Pyramid</b> serving recommendations appropriate to the age and gender composition of the U. S. population. In addition, while the healthfulness of diets has improved over time, the pace of improvement has been uneven. For example, while Americans consumed record amounts {{of fruits and vegetables}} in 1996, consumption of caloric sweeteners also reached a 27 -year high. This report is the first dietary assessment to use ERSís time-series food supply data to compare average diets with Federal dietary recommendations depicted in the <b>Food</b> Guide <b>Pyramid.</b> <b>Food</b> Guide <b>Pyramid</b> servings were estimated for more than 250 agricultural commodities for 1970 - 96.

500|$|The {{title is}} a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several {{scenes from the}} Army {{training}} contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the song playing during the recruitment video bears a close resemblance to the Def Leppard song [...] "Pour Some Sugar On Me". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training {{is similar to that}} in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will have to listen to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his [...] "kids" [...] with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song [...] "Bring Da Ruckus", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene {{about the importance of the}} <b>food</b> <b>pyramid.</b> The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says [...] "Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be [...] "Fraggle Ir-Rock", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. [...] When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie says that 10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle. After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read about the war in Iraq in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relation}} between dietary fat and atherosclerosis is controversial. Writing in Science, Gary Taubes detailed that political considerations played into {{the recommendations of}} government bodies.

The American Heart Association, [...] the American Diabetes Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program make similar recommendations.

Sob o enfoque da Nutrição, as pirâmides alimentares são consideradas ferramentas de orientação que podem transmitir conhecimentos relativos a uma alimentação considerada adequada. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o potencial comunicativo da pirâmide alimentar na perspectiva da semiótica.

Our study compares the dietary quality of popular weight-loss plans.

The criterion for determining which weight-loss plans were the most popular was their status on the New York Times Bestseller list.

Analysis of variance was used to compare nutrient information among the weight-loss plans. The AHEI scores adjusted for energy content were also compared.
