5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the <b>downdraft.</b> If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The <b>downdraft</b> will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the <b>downdraft</b> cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The <b>downdraft</b> hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes from supercells {{follow a}} {{recognizable}} life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the rear flank <b>downdraft</b> (RFD).

5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} <b>downdraft,</b> cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank <b>downdraft</b> of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the <b>downdraft</b> will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E

Convective evolution within the inner core conforms to patterns shown by previous studies: convection initiates downshear-right, intensifies downshear-left and weakens upshear. Analysis of the vertical distribution of radar reflectivity and vertical air motion indicates the development of upper-level <b>downdrafts</b> in conjunction with strong convection downshear-left and a maximum in frequency upshear-left. Intense updrafts and <b>downdrafts</b> both conform to the shear asymmetry pattern. While strong updrafts occur within the eyewall, intense <b>downdrafts</b> show far more radial variability, particularly in the upshear-left quadrant, though they concentrate along the eyewall edges.

5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank <b>downdraft</b> (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a <b>downdraft</b> dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of the island, the tight {{pressure}} gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100mph (161km/h) at Devonshire. A cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118mph (190km/h), though it could have been caused by a <b>downdraft.</b> The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3inches (76mm), resulting in minor flooding of streets. Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in <b>downdraft</b> processes.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the <b>downdraft</b> region of the storm. The {{convergence}} of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank <b>downdraft</b> occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E

40|$|The mixing {{mechanism}} of South African cumulus congestus clouds is investigated using a combined observational and modeling approach. The experimental data consists of aircraft measurements collected in developing cloud towers near Nelspruit on three case study days. The observations are analyzed {{to determine the}} source regions of the entrained air. The mixing processes are simulated using both axially and slab symmetric cumulus models with very high spatial and temporal resolutions. The simulated clouds have a structured organization with small scale features such as in-cloud <b>downdrafts.</b> The mixing processes are examined by analyzing the time variation of dynamic and thermodynamic quantities along computed parcel trajectories. Both observations and simulations indicate {{that most of the}} entrainment occurs at the cloud top. Evaporative cooling causes <b>downdrafts</b> that transport highly diluted air from the cloud top down to lower levels. The trajectory analysis shows that the penetrative <b>downdrafts</b> are also affected by pressure perturbations. In the presence of wind shear the downshear sides of the clouds become more diluted, cooler and have stronger <b>downdrafts.</b> The asymmetric organisation is attributed to turbulent exchange of horizontal momentum at the cloud top...|$|R
5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a <b>downdraft</b> marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E

Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the <b>downdraft</b> tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the <b>downdraft</b> of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that aerosols affect clouds {{and that the}} effect of aerosols on clouds is critical for understanding human-induced climate change. Most climate model studies have focused on the effect of aerosols on warm stratiform clouds (e. g., stratocumulus clouds) for the prediction of climate change. However, systems like the Asian and Indian Monsoon, storm tracks, and the intertropical convergence zone, play important roles in the global hydrological cycle and in the circulation of energy and are driven by thunderstorm-type convective clouds. Here, we show that the different morphologies of these two cloud types lead to different aerosol-cloud interactions. Increasing aerosols are known to suppress the conversion of droplets to rain (i. e., so-called autoconversion). This increases droplets as a source of evaporative cooling, leading to an increased intensity of <b>downdrafts.</b> The acceleration of the intensity of <b>downdrafts</b> is larger in convective clouds due to their larger cloud depths (providing longer paths for <b>downdrafts</b> to follow to the surface) than in stratiform clouds. More accelerated <b>downdrafts</b> intensify the gust front, leading to significantly increased updrafts, condensation and thus the collection of cloud liquid by precipitation, which offsets the suppressed autoconversion. This leads to an enhancement of precipitation with increased aerosols in convective clouds. However, the <b>downdrafts</b> are less accelerated in stratiform clouds due to their smaller cloud depths, and they are not able to induce changes in updrafts as large as those in convective clouds. Thus, the offset is not as effective, and this allows the suppression of precipitation with increased aerosols. Thus aerosols affect these cloud systems differently. The dependence of the effect of aerosols on clouds on the morphology of clouds should be taken into account for a more complete assessment of climate change...|$|R
