5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge at low tide.)

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battles}} at P'ohang-dong raged to the south, the ROK 3rd Division faced {{increasing}} {{pressure from the}} NK 5th Division. North Korean officers from the division continued to attack the ROK unit hoping it would collapse, and the North Korean troops were able to slowly erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> into a smaller and smaller pocket. The ROK division was forced further south {{to the village of}} Changsa-dong, where U.S. Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by LSTs and DUKWs.|$|E

As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> from the hill after a short fight.

5|$|In the meantime, the NK 6th Division {{had made}} {{breakthroughs}} in the US 24th Infantry sector to the south, overwhelming the regiment and <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> back. The 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, on the ridges overlooking Haman, was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders. Survivors from the 24th Infantry's 1st and 2nd battalions later {{appeared in the}} 35th's lines, and the regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack. Kean ordered the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry to move in and help restore the 24th's position.|$|E
5|$|Lord Goring, who had {{proposed}} the second siege, renewed the blockade {{for a third}} time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon's departing army and <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> back into Taunton. Goring's siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, who would have otherwise been available to fight for King Charles at Naseby, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, Thomas Fairfax marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.|$|E

5|$|On 17 August, the Serbs {{attempted}} to retake Šabac, but their efforts failed.

5|$|The 1st Brigade {{had just}} 33 tanks {{remaining}} after losing 20 tanks. This prompted Second Army command to transfer {{a battalion of}} 21 tanks on October 18 from the 2nd Infantry Division to the north to reinforce the dwindling tank numbers in 16th Division's bridgehead. As the battalion moved south, {{a large number of}} Israeli aircraft attacked the formation, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> to undertake evasive maneuvers, turning eastwards and fanning out in the desert terrain, thereby avoiding losses.

The two North Korean aircraft maneuvered around Moran's aircraft and opened fire, damaging the tail of his plane. Hudson responded by attacking the lead plane, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> to ascend further. Hudson's shots struck the aircraft in the fuselage and right wing.|$|E
5|$|The last {{survivors}} of the Batavian squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16-gun Mercury, <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> to surrender just before 11:00.

Later in the day, Halstead's Phoenix was able to seize the Batavian prize Duke of York, completing the destruction of the entire Batavian squadron.|$|E

The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and <b>forcing</b> <b>it</b> to crash.

When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981.

The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
