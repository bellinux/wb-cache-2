If the Saxons take part,' as they surely will, 'in the Invasion of Silesia, and we beat them, I am determined to plunge into Saxony. For great maladies, there need great remedies. Either I will maintain my all, or else lose my all. [Hear it, friend; and understand it,--with hair lying flat!] It is true, the disaffection of the Russian Court, on such trifling grounds, {{was not to be}} expected; and great misfortune can befall us. Well; a year or two sooner, a year or two later,--it is not worth one's while to bother about the very worst. If things take the better turn, our condition will be surer and firmer than it was before. If we have nothing to reproach ourselves with, neither need we fret and plague ourselves about bad events, which can happen to any man.'--'I am causing despatch a secret Order for Boden [on YOU know what], which you will not deliver him till I give sign.'"--On hearing of the Peace of Fussen, perhaps a day or so later, Friedrich again writes:-- ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hi</b> Mom, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> ” Michelle {{asked her}} mother over the phone. “I’m fine, is {{everything}} okay with you? You sound a bit down, ” said her mother. “It’s probably nothing, but Tabby doesn’t seem quite right, ” Michelle replied. “What’s {{the matter with}} him? ” Michelle’s mother asked anxiously. “He wasn’t looking very well, and {{it felt as if}} he had a fever. Remember I told you he had a swollen leg? Well, it seemed as though it was causing him pain. He seemed so miserable, and so I gave him half of a regularstrength Tylenol®. He just doesn’t seem right, ” Michelle blurted out. “I saw a news item a month or so ago that said that Tylenol ® wasn’t very safe—something about it not being good for the liver. I remember they said it was bad for humans in high doses. I don’t think they mentioned anything about animals. But don’t worry, ” Michelle’s mother reassured her. “Cats are very tough—they have nine lives, you know. And besides, you only gave him half a tablet. ” “Thanks, Mom. I better go now. Talk to you later, ” Michelle hurried off. The conversation with her mother had made Michelle uneasy. Tabby seemed very sad, tired, and out of breath. Michelle decided that she would search the Internet for information about acetaminophen, the active ingredient of Tylenol®. In particular, she wanted to know the safe dose for cats. She came across a 2003 articl...|$|R
30|$|Assessing {{outcomes}} of educational efforts {{in terms of}} competence {{has a long tradition}} in fields of general education and gained particular recognition through international large-scale assessments such as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). However, respective efforts to measure domain-specific vocational and professional competences are still rare. In 2011, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched the research initiative ‘Technology-Based Assessment of Skills and Competencies in Vocational Education and Training (ASCOT)’. The initiative aimed at the development of computer-based instruments for the assessment of domain-specific competences in selected vocations in Germany on the basis of authentic work and business processes. The work presented in this paper is part of a research project entitled ‘Modelling and measuring domain-specific problem-solving competence of industrial clerks (DomPL-IK)’. 1 In the following, we want to highlight two innovative features of our competence measurement in the business domain: (1) With problem-solving competence we address higher-order competences instead of just knowledge reproduction. Therefore, we did not only develop complex problem scenarios within an authentic office simulation but also provided an open-ended and authentic problem space for working on these problems rather than apply highly structured items (e.g., multiple choice items). The analysis of the participants’ complex behavior patterns was based on a theoretically driven competence model and on item response theory (IRT). (2) As an alternative to relying on detached self-report questionnaires, we implemented an integrated measurement of non-cognitive facets of competence (i.e., facets of self-concept and interest) that we refer to as ‘Embedded Experience Sampling’ (EES): Test-takers in a complex problem-solving task are requested to stop at certain times during the test and spontaneously answer short prompts regarding their actual experience of the problem situation (e.g., ‘Your colleague Julian visits your office: <b>Hi,</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> I heard {{you have to deal with}} a rather large task. Well, I just wanted to ask <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing.’; answers were to be given on a four-point Likert scale, e.g. from ‘At the moment, I feel not at all confident’ =  1 to ‘… very confident’ =  4). The project is located in commercial vocational education and training (VET). Nevertheless, the approach is applicable in other domains as well.|$|R
