25|$|Furthermore, {{the cold}} winter {{temperatures}} prematurely halted fermentation in the cellars, leaving dormant yeast cells that would awaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> of spring and start fermenting again. One of the byproducts of fermentation is {{the release of}} carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc in the cellars. If the bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault. As late as the 17th century, Champenois wine makers, most notably the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon (1638–1715), were still trying to rid their wines of the bubbles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the relation of perceived parenting (including involvement, autonomy support and warmth dimensions) with emotional intelligence. 352 students (142 boys, 210 girls) completed the Perception Of Parents Scale (Grolnick, Deci, & Ryan, 1997), and Emotional Intelligence Scale (Shutte et al, 1998).

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2016. Major: Mass Communication. Advisors: Jennifer Ball, Jisu Huh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 121 pages. Recently, <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal <b>in</b> advertisements has drawn much attention. This study seeks {{to examine the}} widely used warm creative approaches in advertising and to examine unintended negative effects of <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal by applying two fundamental dimensions of social perceptions, warmth and competence, and a compensation effect between the two to the advertising and branding context. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to examine: 1) under what conditions a warmth appeal can attenuate perceived competence of a brand; 2) how the potential negative effects of a warmth appeal on brand competence affects overall brand evaluation (brand attitudes); and 3) a mechanism of these unintended negative effects of a warmth appeal on brand attitudes. To investigate the effects of <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> advertising appeal, this study focuses on several specific variables: 1) advertising warmth, 2) perceptions of a product category, 3) perceived competence of a brand, and 4) attitude toward the advertised brand. Particularly, this study seeks to demonstrate an interaction effect on brand competence between <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal and <b>the</b> product category. To demonstrate the interaction effect, this study uses two different product categories: a high strength-related product category and a high gentleness-related product category. Based on this categorization, this study posits that <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> advertising appeal can attenuate competence perceptions of a brand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high strength-related product category, which would lead to a negative effect on brand attitude. On the other hand, this study proposes that warmth appeals could enhance competence perceptions of a brand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high gentleness-related product category and it would result in more positive brand attitude. The problems of this study were examined by considering consumers’ categorization mental activity and inferential processes of warm advertisements against a product category of <b>the</b> advertised brand. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> high strength-related product category which is perceived as low warm, when <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal is used in an ad, a compensation effect would occur and perceived brand competence would be lowered, which will lead to decrease in brand attitude. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high gentleness-related product category, when <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal is used, perceived brand competence will be enhanced, which would lead to increase in brand attitude. Additionally, considering that perceived brand competence has more impact on brand attitude, lowered brand competence would function as a mediating variable <b>in</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> appeal and brand attitude in a high strength-related product category. To test these hypotheses, this study employed a 2 (a warmth advertising appeal: presence vs. absence) x 2 (a product category based on the type of benefit: when gentleness-related attributes are highly valued vs. when strength-related attributes are highly valued) between-subjects factorial design. However, the results did not support the study hypotheses. Instead, ads with warmth appeals enhanced perceived brand competence and attitude toward the brand rather than they attenuated them. The Discussion Chapter explains why the experiment failed to support hypotheses by focusing on the methodological and theoretical issues in this study...|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that {{are very close to}} the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be <b>in</b> conserving <b>the</b> nest <b>warmth.</b> <b>The</b> optimal temperature of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|R
