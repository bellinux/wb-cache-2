6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{answered}} passionately. [...] "You know that I am not. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{you told me}} that I was good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! I {{never did}} so till I had told myself that, if possible, {{you should be}} my own. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> you poked the fire for me at Hendon Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} make an angekok," [...] said Ujarak, {{with a look}} of displeasure, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not rouse up your memory more. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I whispered to you in a dream last night that strange things were going to happen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take no heed of my looks," [...] he was saying. [...] "I desire them up yonder {{to think}} that I abuse you. Look as a man would who were being abused. Cringe or snarl, but listen. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> once <b>when</b> as lads we swam {{together}} from Penarrow to Trefusis Point?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now really, Miss Venetia, do {{not take}} on so!' said Pauncefort; 'for <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> his lordship ran away from the abbey, and went a gipsying, nothing would persuade poor Mrs. Cadurcis {{that he was not}} robbed and murdered, and yet you see he was as safe and sound all the time, {{as if he had been}} at Cherbury.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{you told}} me coming to her was an experiment, and you {{thought it might be}} better for the old {{friendship}} if you did not accept the situation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, my dear, don't you be hard upon her. We {{have all}} been foolish in our days. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> Sir Lionel used to be here, how foolish you and I were?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{she replied}} slowly, [...] "that Count Sabatini is the strangest man whom I ever met. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{he stood and}} looked down upon us? I felt--but it was so foolish!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> {{the time}} <b>when</b> {{we were at}} the Hall Farm together, and that night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend in trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Beasley, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> {{last fall}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> met Snake Anson with his gang {{up in the}} woods--and hired him to make off with me?" [...] asked Helen, in swift, ringing words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank Heaven," [...] said Leo, [...] "we are {{together}} again at last! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Horace, that <b>when</b> {{we entered the}} land of Kor it was thus, in a boat? The tale repeats itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{take your}} own case, King, {{and go back}} a couple of years. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> Prout and you were on their track for hutting and trespass, wasn't it? Have you {{forgotten}} Colonel Dabney?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ethel. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> we were children, and {{you used}} to make {{drawings}} for us? I have some now that you did--in my geography book, which I used to read and read with Miss Quigley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>when</b> we parted at my home; {{when you}} left on this terrible trail, now ended, thank God! Do you remember what an ordeal that was for me? Must I go through it again?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> in history, how Napoleon turned pale when {{he heard}} that the Duke of Wellington was to lead the allies in Belgium? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> how <b>when</b> Themistocles heard that Aristogiton was to lead the Spartans, he jumped into the sea? Possibly you don't, but it may help you to form {{some idea of what}} John Henry Bagshaw felt {{when he heard}} that the Conservatives had {{selected}} Josh Smith, proprietor of Smith's Hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who else? What other {{lord and}} master? My bosom's own; my heart's best hope; my spot of terra firma; my cool running brook of fresh water; my rock; my love; my lord; my all! Is he always {{thinking}} of his absent Lizzie? Does he still toil at Downing Street? Oh, dear; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Frank, <b>when</b> {{he told us that}} 'one of us must remain in town?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; and if {{you will}} listen I'll tell <b>you</b> all. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> what {{happened}} <b>when</b> I {{came into the room}} last night? Why, she turned colour and nearly fainted away. That was because she knew me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> we went [...] Under {{a dragon}} moon, [...] And 'mid {{volcanic}} tints of night [...] Walked where they fought the unknown fight [...] And saw black {{trees on the}} battle-height, [...] Black thorn on Ethandune? ...|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. He was {{so fond of}} us both. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> he was {{recovering}} from the measles, his crying for us to bath him instead of Mrs. Bennet? I have always reproached myself that we refused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very prettily said, my dear. I {{never look}} round this room without {{thinking}} of the first time I came here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> I found the old man sitting there?" [...] The old man alluded to was the late Duke.|$|E
60|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> how <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{first began}} to make money you used to plan that {{just as soon as}} you were rich, really rich, you'd go back home again to the little town and build a great big house with a fine verandah,--no stint about it, the best that money could buy, planed lumber, every square foot of it, and a fine picket fence in front of it.|$|R
6000|$|Here Quincey Morris added, [...] "I {{understand}} that the Count comes from a wolf country, {{and it may be}} that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Art, <b>when</b> we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater apiece!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am none {{of these}} things, O Morning-Star, I am yourself. I am that Ka whom our father Amen gave to you at birth to dwell with you and protect <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> me <b>when</b> as a child we played together?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{joke that}} was!" [...] exclaimed Lettie, [...] "we {{used to go}} in the {{arboretum}} at dinner-time. You lasted half one autumn. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> we gave a concert, you and I, and Frank Wishaw, in the small lecture theatre?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must {{be going}} down to look up a bit to read. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> Harper read the same bit six days running? I shall never forget Ward's pained expression. Harper {{explained}} that he thought the passage so beautiful that he couldn't leave it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You weren't a fool {{when you}} took me out through the orchard and caught me when I jumped over the wall. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> you asked me, all of a sudden, whether I should like to be your wife? You weren't a fool then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Betteredge," [...] he said, [...] "how {{does the}} {{atmosphere}} of mystery and suspicion {{in which we are}} all living now, agree with <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that morning <b>when</b> I first came here with the Moonstone? I wish to God we had thrown it into the quicksand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes indeed! You were in {{a towering}} rage. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember?</b> It was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{discovered}} that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantel-piece, twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I must say----" ...|$|R
6000|$|HE [going to her] Oh don't, don't {{think of}} people in that way. Don't think of her at all. [He takes her hand and {{sits down on the}} carpet at her feet]. Aurora: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the evening <b>when</b> I sat here at your feet and read you those poems for the first time? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I mean. It's such {{a strange}} thing {{that it should be}} the man we know ourselves. These things always are {{happening}} to me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> poor Fred Fellows got his bad fall and died the next year? You weren't here then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is meant, {{though it}} could not be done. Frank, I must not see her, not for awhile; not for years. I do not wish to hate her, but how can I help it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> she flew into your arms in this room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS MARCH. And no {{business}} to meddle with practical affairs. You {{and he always}} ride {{in front of the}} hounds. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> the war broke out, how angry you were with me because I said we were fighting from a sense of self-preservation? Well, weren't we? ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. No. I am just {{preparing}} you. You see, darling, I can't {{call you}} Dad when {{my hair is}} up. I think I shall call you Parent. (He growls.) Parent dear, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the days <b>when</b> your Margaret was a slip of a girl, and sat on your knee? How foolish we were, Parent, in those distant days.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{might have}} known," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{might have known}} what he was. I had heard you talk of him. I had seen him in <b>you,</b> and I <b>did</b> not know. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that day <b>when</b> {{we were in the}} summer-house {{together}} at Glencoe, long ago? When you had come back from seeing him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Emlyn, I {{want what}} I always wanted {{and you always}} refused--your help, your {{partnership}}. I mean the partnership of that brain of yours--the help of the knowledge that you have--no more. At Cranwell Towers you called down evil on me. Take off that ban, for I'll speak truth, it weighs heavy on my mind. Let us bury the past; let us clasp hands and be friends. You have the true vision. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> thought Cicely dead, you said that her seed should rise up against me, and now it seems {{that it will be}} so." ...|$|R
