40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of photoperiod on the forage yield by ecotypes and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> of P. notatum. Tetraploid ecotypes from the United States Department of Agriculture and the National University of the Northeast in Argentina, in addition to six <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids,</b> totaling 19 ecotypes, were assessed. The materials evaluated were subjected to an extended photoperiod (14 h of light) and natural photoperiod from July 2011 to October 2012. The experimental design was a completely randomized factorial scheme of 19 × 2 (ecotypes × photoperiod) consisting of five replicates. The materials were influenced differentially by the variation in photoperiod, with one group showing high sensitivity, whereas another, smaller group, was insensitive to this factor. The use of materials with differentiated responses to photoperiod in different climatic regions can be an important tool to increase forage yield of Paspalum notatum...|$|R

From a diallel design including 55 intra- and interspecific hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum grown at two temperatures in enological conditions, we analyzed as many as 35 fermentation traits with original statistical and modeling tools. We first showed that, depending on the types of trait - kinetics parameters, life-history traits, enological parameters and aromas -, the sources of variation (strain, temperature and strain * temperature effects) differed in a large extent. Then we compared globally three groups of hybrids and their parents at two growth temperatures: <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> S. cerevisiae * S. cerevisiae, <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> S. uvarum * S. uvarum and interspecific hybrids S. cerevisiae * S. uvarum.

40|$|A type of <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> sterility, {{between two}} strains of Drosophila melanogaster, {{referred}} to as GD (gonadal dysgenesis) sterility, is observed when females from a type of strain called M are crossed with males from a second type called P. Absence of egg-laying is characteristic of female GD sterility and its manifestation is conditional on high developmental temperatures. Morphological and cytological studies of GD sterile females are described. These individuals were normal in body size and external appearance. No defects in sperm storage were observed. Both adult and larval ovaries were drastically reduced in size in comparison with control ovaries. This ovarian dysgenesis was sometimes unilateral, but more frequently it was bilateral, particularly in females developing at the highest test temperature. The ovarioles of dysgenic ovaries contained no vitellaria; the germaria lacked any cells resembling the cystocyte clusters of normal ovaries. It is concluded that sterility results from an early blockage in ovarian development, rather than from atrophy of previously developed structures.

For this, 14 intraspecific and five interspecific cotton F- 1 hybrids were evaluated at two locations (Sindos and Vardates) during the 1985 - 88 period. In addition, two interspecific hybrids (5, 6), the three best (8, 7, 11) and two {{among the worst}} (4, 10) intraspecific F(1) s and their F- 2 bulks were also evaluated at Sindos in 1986. This evaluation was repeated in the following years. In each successive year the new generation (up to the F- 5 bulk) was included. <b>Intraspecific</b> F- 1 <b>hybrids</b> outyielded the best variety at both locations. Lint yield of the F- 1 hybrids ranged from 99 to 158 % with a mean value of 122 %. Useful F- 1 heterosis (hybrids with higher values than the best check cultivar) was also expressed for boil weight and Verticillium wilt infestation. The latter was more pronounced in hybrids derived from tolerant parents. All F- 1 interspecific hybrids were dominated by the barbadense phenotype and had its superior fiber lint quality, lower lint percentage, and resistance to Verticillium wilt. In addition, they expressed positive heterosis for lint yield at Sindos and negative at Vardates, compared with the check variety. The frequency of the hirsutum phenotype progressively increased in the F- 2 through F- 5 generations, with plant height, bell weight, earliness, fiber quality and wilt tolerance moving toward the hirsutum values. In the F- 2 generation yield dropped dramatically (> 50 %) in the interspecific hybrids, whereas in the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> inbreeding depression was much less and varied from hybrid to hybrid. The good F(1) s <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> maintained part of their useful heterosis in the F- 2. From the F- 3 onwards the yield improved in the interspecific crosses and stabilized around 75 % of the yield recorded in the best check variety. In contrast, the highest yielding F- 1 <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> yielded progressively less in subsequent generations, and in the F- 5 they produced the same yield as the best cultivar, whereas the yield of the lowest yielding <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> was stabilized around 95 % of the yield recorded in the best cultivar.

Results show significant proportions of exotic male gametes before seed dispersal in the two pine relicts. Subsequently to seedling establishment, the frequency of exotic male gametes became non-significant in P. pinaster, and dropped by half in P. sylvestris. Exotic zygotic gene flow was significantly different from zero among early recruits for P. sylvestris, decreasing throughout seedling establishment. Seedling mortality resulted in small late sample sizes, and temporal differences in exotic gene flow estimates were not significant, so we could not reject the null hypothesis of invariant early viability across parental cross types in the wild...|$|E
40|$|Species {{differentiation}} and {{the underlying}} genetics of reproductive isolation are central topics in evolutionary biology. Hybrid sterility is one kind of reproductive barrier {{that can lead to}} differentiation between species. Here, we analyze the complex genetic basis of the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> male sterility that occurs in the offspring of two distant natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, Shandara and Mr- 0, with Shandara as the female parent. Using both classical and quantitative genetic approaches as well as cytological observation of pollen viability, we demonstrate that this particular hybrid sterility results from two causes of pollen mortality. First, the Shandara cytoplasm induces gametophytic cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) controlled by several nuclear loci. Second, several segregation distorters leading to allele-specific pollen abortion (pollen killers) operate in hybrids with either cytoplasm. The complete sterility of the hybrid with the Shandara cytoplasm results from the genetic linkage of the two causes of pollen mortality, i. e., CMS nuclear determinants and pollen killers. Furthermore, natural variation at these loci in A. thaliana is associated with different male sterility phenotypes in intraspecific hybrids. Our results suggest that the genomic conflicts that underlie segregation distorters and CMS can concurrently lead to reproductive barriers between distant strains within a species. This study provides a new framework for identifying molecular mechanisms and the evolutionary history of loci that contribute to reproductive isolation, and possibly to speciation. It also suggests that two types of genomic conflicts, CMS and segregation distorters, may coevolve in natural populations...|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{female and male}} {{sterility}} were observed among the hybrids {{from one of the}} two reciprocal crosses between a wild strain of D. melanogaster known as π 2 and laboratory strains. The sterility, which is part of a common syndrome called hybrid dysgenesis, was found {{to be associated with the}} rudimentary condition of one or both of the ovaries or testes. All other tissues, including those of the reproductive system were normal, as were longevity and mating behavior. The morphological details of the sterility closely mimic the agametic condition occurring when germ cells are destroyed by irradiation or by the maternal-effect mutation, grandchildless. We suggest that sterility in hybrid dysgenesis is also caused by failure in the early development of germ cells. There is a thermo-sensitive period beginning at approximately the time of initiation of mitosis among primordial germ cells a few hours before the egg hatches and ending during the early larval stages. Our results suggest that hybrid dysgenesis, which also includes male recombination, mutation and other traits, may be limited to the germ line, and that each of the primordial germ cells develops, or fails to develop, independently of the others. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed frequencies of unilateral and bilateral sterility, with the shape of the thermosensitivity curves and with the fact that males are less often sterile than females.

In the present study, using a newly developed mapping model that can analyze the embryo and maternal main effects as well as QTL × environment interaction effects on quantitative quality trait loci (QTLs) in cottonseeds, a study on QTL located in the tetraploid embryo and tetraploid maternal plant genomes for essential amino acid contents in cottonseeds under different environments was carried out, using the immortal F 2 (IF 2) populations from a set of 188 recombinant inbred lines derived from an <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> cross of two upland cotton germplasms HS 46 and MARKCBUCAG 8 US- 1 - 88 as experimental materials.

Eighteen QTLs were also found having QTL × environment (QE) interaction effects. The genetic main effects from QTLs located on chromosomes in the embryo and maternal plant genomes and their QE effects in different environments were all important for these essential amino acids in cottonseeds.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the technological usefulness of selected industrial wine yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus and their intra- and interspecific hybrids responsible for excessively acidic musts. The stability of yeast fermentation profiles in apple musts was assessed after 90 – 170 generations, following previous subculturing under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in media with or without L-malic acid. During this study, 35 apple wines produced by wild strains and their segregates were statistically evaluated according to 12 chemical parameters. Although the wines met the official standards for basic chemical parameters, their total acidity was too low. Both the yeasts and their segregates metabolized from 66. 3 to 77. 0 % of malic acid present in the must. The industrial wine yeasts and their hybrids exhibited marked polymorphism of fermentation profiles in apple must with elevated L-malic acid content. At the same time, the level of demalication activity made it possible to clearly differentiate segregates from the wild strains, which may suggest that malic acid is probably one of the principal factors in the adaptive evolution of yeasts. Our study proves that among industrial wine yeasts, there are both, strains expressing very high stability (Saccharomyces cerevisiae W- 13) and labile ones (S. cerevisiae Syrena). The interspecific hybrids S. cerevisiae × S. bayanus showed low stability of technological features, while the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> of S. cerevisiae preserved its fermentative capacity.

Before achieving hybridization, the floral ratio and the breeding system of physic nut were studied in Southern Benin ecological conditions.

Previously described variable chloroplast restriction sites infer M. douglasii as the possible maternal parent of both tetraploid species. However, the chloroplast genome typical for M. douglasii has now also been found in some plants of M. elegans. RAPD analysis revealed 172 polymorphic DNA markers that defined all four species as genetically distinct groups, but demonstrated closer associations between M. douglasii and M. acuminata, and between M. elegans and M. campestris. Sequencing of the ITS- 1 and ITS- 2 region yielded 73 phylogenetically informative sites. Thirty basepair mutations separated the annual Microseris species from the outgroup, Uropappus lindleyi. The putative interspecific allotetraploid M. campestris contained only one type ITS sequence that, on the basis of eight synapomorphic substitutions was derived from M. elegans. The single ITS of M. acuminata shares six common sites with M. douglasii. Surprisingly, six sites were synapomorphic for the two tetraploids, M. campestris and M. acuminata, suggesting recombination within the ITS of both species with that of a common, now extinct, parental taxon, possibly the donor of the M. douglasii type chloroplasts found in both tetraploids.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{reproductive}} phenology of {{perennial plants}} in temperate climates is largely conditioned by {{the duration of}} bud dormancy, and fruit developmental processes. Bud dormancy release and bud break depends on the perception of cumulative chilling and heat during the bud development. The objective of this work was to identify new quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated to temperature requirements for bud dormancy release and flowering and to fruit harvest date, in a segregating population of peach. Results We have identified QTLs for nine traits related to bud dormancy, flowering and fruit harvest in an <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> population of peach in two locations differing in chilling time accumulation. QTLs were located in a genetic linkage map of peach based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for eight linkage groups (LGs) of the peach genome sequence. QTLs for chilling requirements for dormancy release and blooming clustered in seven different genomic regions that partially coincided with loci identified in previous works. The most significant QTL for chilling requirements mapped to LG 1, close to the evergrowing locus. QTLs for heat requirement related traits were distributed in nine genomic regions, four of them co-localizing with QTLs for chilling requirement trait. Two major loci in LG 4 and LG 6 determined fruit harvest time. Conclusions We identified QTLs associated to nine traits related to the reproductive phenology in peach. A search of candidate genes for these QTLs rendered different genes related to flowering regulation, chromatin modification and hormone signalling.

The performance of 22 clones of Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. -Arg., evolved at IAC, {{over a period of}} eleven years was evaluated in the Western Central part of the São Paulo State, Brazil. Among these 22 new clones, six were <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> clones (IAC 400, IAC 404, IAC 405, IAC 406, IAC 410, IAC 412) and the remaining are primary those resulted from selected ortets within half-sib progenies. An old popular clone RRIM 600, of Malaysian origin, was used as the control. The trial was laid out in a randomized block design with three replications. Yield performance over a period of four years, mean girth at the 11 th year, girth increment before tapping and on tapping, thermal property of natural rubber produced, bark thickness, number of latex vessel rows in seven year virgin bark, percentage incidence of tapping panel dryness, wind damage and diseases like leaf and panel anthracnose have been observed. Sixty one percent of the clones were superior in relation to the control for yield. The clone IAC 400 recorded the highest yield (97. 40 g tree- 1 tap- 1) over four years of tapping, followed by IAC 411 (78. 87 tree- 1 tap- 1), whereas the control clone RRIM 600 recorded 50. 86 g tree- 1 tap- 1. All selected clones were vigorous in growth. Girth increment of these clones was average to above average. Except for IAC 423, other clones had thick virgin bark at opening ranging from 4. 84 mm for IAC 401 to 6. 38 mm for IAC 416. The natural rubbers from IAC clones have shown good thermal stability up to 300 ºC and no differences in the thermal behavior among rubber from clones of the IAC series and the clone RRIM 600 were found in inert atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o desempenho produtivo durante a fase inicial, de crescimento e o rendimento de filé na fase de engorda de diferentes linhagens de tilápia do Nilo existentes no Brasil. As linhagens estudadas foram: o híbrido intra-específico (HIB), cruzamento entre o macho Chitralada (tailandês) e a fêmea Bouaké (brasileira); a Bouaké (BOK), conhecida popularmente como Nilótica; a Chitralada, primeira geração da tailandesa (CHI 1); a Chitralada, segunda geração da tailandesa (CHI 2). Este experimento foi conduzido em quatro fases, no período de dezembro de 2000 a agosto de 2001. Durante as três primeiras fases foi utilizada uma instalação do tipo estufa, com 24 caixas, com capacidade de 250 L, nas quais foram testados os quatro tratamentos com seis repetições.

The CHI 1 and CHI 2 and the HIB showed a mayor tolerance and a mayor storage density and final biomass than the BOK. To the average values of carcass weight in the fatten phase (4 ª phase) were: 261, 99 g (HIB); 177, 98 g (BOK); 292, 75 g (CHI 1) e 307, 82 g (CHI 2); the strains CHI 1, CHI 2 and the HIB presented the best results, obtaining significative differences of BOK. The results obtained to fillet yield showed that there was no significative difference between the strains. These results showed, that the strains with best general performance, was Chitralada (CHI 1 and CHI 2), followed by hybrid (HIB) and the Bouaké (BOK) strains...|$|E
40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the world. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont. de Bary) is the causal agent of late blight which is the most devastating disease of the cultivated potato. It causes economic losses of several billion US dollars in crop production and protection annually worldwide. To control this disease, the application of enormous amounts of chemicals is required, which is expensive and environmentally unsafe. Also, late blight is increasingly more difficult to control because the pathogen is developing tolerance to the chemicals and new strains of the pathogen are evolving. Therefore, introduction of resistance genes from wild Solanum species into potato cultivars is considered as the most promising and environmental-safe approach to achieve durable late blight resistance. Late blight resistance exists in a wide range of Solanum wild species of which 75 % have a diploid constitution (2 n= 2 x= 24) although the majority of the cultivated potato is tetraploid (2 n= 4 x= 48). Therefore, several different approaches such as the use of 2 n gametes, colchicine treatment, intraspecific hybridization, somatic hybridization, embryo rescue and gene transformation are used to overcome the difficulties caused by different ploidy levels. Of these approaches, gene transformation is the most controlled and time-efficient method to introduce resistance into the cultivated potato. However, gene identification and gene isolation are the first prerequisites for this approach. During the last century, most effort for late blight resistance was focused on the wild species S. demissum which contains at least 11 race-specific resistance genes (R 1 - R 11). However, these resistances were rapidly overcome by new virulent pathogens which evolved. Therefore, new sources of late blight resistance are required and several resistances from different wild species such as S. microdontum, S. bulbocastanum, S. berthaultii and S. pinnatisectum were characterized. In the present research, we investigated both foliage and tuber blight resistances in different mapping populations derived from different sources of Solanum species. The pathogen P. infestans can infect both foliage and tuber of potato. To study tuber blight resistance, a wounded tuber assay was developed and the correlation between tuber and foliage blight resistance in four different mapping populations CE, SHRH, RH 94 - 076 and RH 4 X- 103, in which foliage blight resistances were identified, was examined (Chapter 2). Tuber blight resistance was found to be correlated with foliage blight resistance in three populations CE, SHRH and RH 94 - 076, while it was independent in the RH 4 X- 103 population. Further investigation to explore late blight resistances using molecular markers and resistance assays on both foliage and tuber with four different isolates was focused on the RH 4 X- 103 population. Three specific resistance genes in foliage, tuber or both were segregating. The tuber blight resistance locus was closely linked to marker GP 179 and co-segregating with the R 1 -derived marker 76 _ 2 s on chromosome 5. The R 1 gene functioned both as a foliage and tuber blight R gene, whereas t he Rpi-abpt and R 3 a genes acted only on foliage. S. bulbocastanum {{is one of the}} most promising wild Solanum species possessing late blight resistance. ABPT material, which is a quadruple hybrid created by bridge crosses using the four Solanum species; S. a caule, S. b ulbocastanum, S. p hureja and S. t uberosum, to overcome incompatibility between S. bulbocastanum and S. tuberosum were used to introduce late blight resistance. A tetraploid mapping population (RH 4 X- 103) containing the late blight resistance gene Rpi-abpt was created by a 4 x- 2 x cross and was originally derived from ABPT material (Chapter 3). Resistance assay and AFLP marker analysis allowed localization of the Rpi-abpt locus on chromosome 4. The origin of the resistance was confirmed by the analysis of Rpi-abpt locus-linked AFLP markers and the resistance assay of ABPT-related wild species accessions. An extended population of 1383 offspring was screened to construct a high-resolution map where the Rpi-abpt locus was consequently localized in a 0. 5 cM interval between flanking AFLP markers and was co-segregating with one AFLP marker. The translated protein sequence of the co-segregating AFLP marker appeared to be highly homologues to several disease resistance proteins. The investigation of the race-specific R 2 -like gene was performed in a diploid mapping population (Chapter 4) primarily used for mapping nematode resistance. R 2 -like was phenotypically indistinguishable from the S. demissum -derived R 2 gene although S. demissum is not directly involved in the pedigree of the population and R 2 -like is expected to originate from another species. The R 2 -like locus was placed in a 0. 4 cM interval, flanked by two AFLP markers on chromosome 4 using the extended population of 1586 offspring. Four AFLP markers were also identified to be co-segregating with the R 2 -like locus. A further late blight R gene (Rpi-blb 3) on chromosome 4 was identified in an <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrid</b> population derived from S. bulbocastanum (Chapter 5). The Rpi-blb 3 locus was localized in a 0. 9 cM interval between flanking AFLP markers and co-segregated with one AFLP marker in a population of 1396 offspring. According to the results of AFLP marker allele similarity tested by all co-segregating markers with four different R genes Rpi-abpt, R 2 -like, Rpi-blb 3 and R 2, the four R genes appeared to be genetically very close and could be members of the same R gene cluster although the four R genes showed different race-specificities and origins. Additional interesting scientific results came from the 4 x- 2 x population (RH 4 X- 103) used for late blight resistance. In this population, the male parent produced unreduced 2 n pollen by FDR (First Division Restitution), allowing the localization of centromeres by using half-tetrad analysis (Chapter 6). 130 male parent-derived AFLP markers were analyzed and the genetic linkage group and location of 95 AFLP markers was determined by comparing them with the reference markers of the ultra high density (UHD) map of potato. Depending on the heterozygosity (simplex) or homozygosity (nulliplex or duplex) of the AFLP markers of the offspring, the position of centromeres and the genetic distance of the AFLP markers from the centromere were determined. In FDR 2 n pollen, all the parental heterozygous loci from centromere to first crossover are expected to be heterozygous (Aa) resulting in simplex genotype (Aaaa) of their offspring, when they are combined with homozygous recessive gametes (aa) from the female parent. In contrast, a single crossover between the locus and centromere releases 50 % homozygous and 50 % heterozygous gametes in FDR. The centromeres of 10 chromosomes were accurately localized. The centromere positions were compared with those, which were putatively identified in the UHD map by the fact that markers are dense due to suppression of recombination, and proved to be identical. The centromere position of two chromosomes could not precisely be determined by the half-tetrad analysis approach due to the absence of the 100 % heterozygous markers. However, their positions could be inferred based on the combination of the results between the increasing or decreasing rate of heterozygosity in the half-tetrad analysis and marker density in the UHD map. Additional investigation of three chromosomes with sufficient numbers of markers proved that only one crossover occurs per chromosome arm, as a result of interference of recombination via centromere and telomere. In conclusion, three different R genes against P. infestans in foliage were identified and the loci were accurately determined. These R loci are genetically very close and could be allelic. Our research for tuber blight resistance showed that R genes are not always active in both foliage and tuber. The results of the research described in this thesis demonstrate a great potential for further research. This will be directed towards the isolation of the R genes which can be used to introduce resistance into cultivated potato and to explore tuber blight resistance using a genetic transformation approach...|$|E

In this regard, in 2013 and 2014, a study {{was carried out}} in order to select the best Brachiaria decumbens <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids,</b> which are superior in relation to production, forage nutritional value, and resistance to spittlebugs. Estimates of genetic parameters and gains with selection were carried out. It was found that there was significant variability between genotypes for all characters. Gain with selection (GS%) ranged from 12 to 324 %, and the highest percentage was found for weight of pure seeds (PS) of seed collectors of the second harvest. For reproductive tillers (RT), C 001 and R 091 hybrids had better performance than the control, and this character may be considered as a parameter to estimate production of pure seeds before flowering starts...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Microseris laciniata is a perennial, self-incompatible species {{classified}} in subgenus Scorzonella. It is morphologically {{the least}} specialized {{species in the}} genus, {{in contrast to the}} members of subgenus Microseris, which are morphologically advanced, self-compatible annuals. First-generation hybrids were available from crosses involving eight populations of two subspecies of Microseris laciniata from southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. This study focused on the morphology and reproductive behavior of twelve different intraspecific crosses of this group. One of the morphological characters investigated was the number of pappus-parts per achene. This trait was chosen not only for the ease with which it can be analysed, but also because it was used in recent studies on evolutionary genetics of Microseris. All the ten families of hybrids tested, except four, showed significant variation in the distribution of pappus-part numbers within themselves. Most of the distribution patterns resembled the "high determining" genotypes reported in the literature. The other morphological trait investigated was the number of phyllaries of the involucre. The phyllaries are an important character in distinguishing the two sub-species of M. laciniata. The proportion of outer versus inner phyllaries was tested statistically to determine whether there were significant differences among the siblings of each hybrid family. This characteristic was found to be uniform in each family, although different families seemed to differ among themselves. The results could not be compared with earlier published accounts, due to differences in cultural conditions for the plants. The reproductive behavior of the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> was studies with respect to (1) seed fertility, (2) pollen stainability, and (3) chromosomal behavior at meiosis. The test plants were crossed in the greenhouse with siblings and sometimes with half-sib plants. The percentage of pollinations that yielded fruits with normal embryos was calculated. The results of these hand pollinations showed widely varying success in seed formation. Sometimes a particular sibling cross would yield one capitulum with no fertile fruits and a second capitulum with mostly normal fruits. There was no tendency for F l's within the same subspecies to be more fertile than F l's between subspecies. The low seed productivity of many sibling crosses, despite their high pollen fertility, is suggestive of shared self-incompatibility factors among sister plants. Pollen stainability was investigated for eight intraspecific and three interspecific hybrids of M. laciniata. Among the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> studied only two had markedly reduced pollen stainability. Pollen germinability in vitro failed in several attempts. In vivo only a few pollen tubes were observed on the styles of two of the four hybrids crossed to their siblings, indicating a strong rejection reaction in all four hybrids tested. Chromosomal behavior at meiosis in <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> was mostly normal, but minor irregularities were seen especially from prophase to first anaphase. No gross structural changes in the chromosomes of M. laciniata were observed, despite the probable antiquity of the species and spatial isolation of its populations...|$|R

These enzymes included five oxidoreductases, five hydrolases, and one lyase.;The isoenzyme patterns of of seven enzymes of Kluyveromyces populations from a variety of habitats were compared. The isolates belonged to the Kluyveromyces lactis and K. marxianus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reassociation groups, and to Kluyveromyces dobzhanskii, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, and Kluyveromyces waltii.;The results of multivariate analysis of the electrophoretic patterns supported the division of the genus into thirteen species, two of which comprised four and five taxa (described by van der Walt, 1970 b) respectively. Electrophoretic data were at variance with in vitro mating compatibility patterns but supported DNA-DNA reassociation data.;Finally, interspecific and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> between K. marxianus and K. thermotolerans and between K. lactis and K. vanudenii, respectively, their parental strains, and their corresponding type cultures were studied by comparison of seven isoenzyme patterns. The parental strains of the interspecific hybrid were very different, and crossing between these two strains did not receive much direct substantiation. The K. marxianus x K. thermotolerans hybrid appeared very similar, electrophoretically, to its K. marxianus parental strain, and had little in common with K. thermotolerans. The loss and gain of bands by the hybrid strain did support Kurtzman 2 ̆ 7 s et al. (1983) suggestion that it might be an aneuploid yeast. Even though the parental strains of the <b>intraspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> had very similar isoenzyme patterns, differences in electrophoretic patterns were observed between parental and hybrid strains, indicating that crossing can occur between K. lactis and K. vanudenii. Certain isoenzymes were found to be better indicators of the hybrid state than other enzymes. The possible relationships between hybrids and populations were explored...|$|R
