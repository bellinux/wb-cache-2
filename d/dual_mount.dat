50|$|A <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> {{stock was}} also {{available}} that converted the M1912 into a double barrel submachine gun {{known as the}} Doppelpistole M.12.|$|E
50|$|The destroyers {{also had}} {{secondary}} armament of two American-produced 3-inch/50 calibre guns in a <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> aft. The 3-inch/50s weighed 1,760 lb and fired a projectile that weighed 24 lb. The guns had a muzzle velocity of 2,700 ft/s {{and a range}} of 14600 yd at a 43° angle. The guns could fire 15 - 20 rounds per minute with a lifespan of 4,300 rounds.|$|E
5000|$|ASW weapons {{included}} two RBU-6000 launchers mounted side by side, {{controlled by the}} [...] "Burya" [...] fire control system with additional 120 rounds in storage, as well as twelve BB-1 conventional depth charges. Cannon armament consisted of two 76 mm AK-726 dual guns mounted on the ships' bow and stern with two AK-230 CIWS placed on the sides and controlled by the MR-104 [...] "Ris" [...] FCS. Air defence was provided by a single <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> for the 4K33 [...] "Osa-M" [...] system with 20 additional missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Haskell-class {{ships were}} armed with one 5"/38 caliber gun, twelve Bofors 40 mm guns (one quad <b>mount,</b> four <b>dual</b> <b>mounts),</b> and ten Oerlikon 20 mm guns.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: 40 mm guns seen on {{the after}} {{superstructure}} of De Ruyter in 1939. It was planned that the 1047s would carry 14 of these weapons in <b>dual</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tan Yang {{served as}} {{flagship}} of the Republic of China Navy, and between 1947 and 1953 was fitted with Type 89 12.7 cm/40 <b>dual</b> <b>mounted</b> guns, {{in addition to}} the Type 98 10cm/65 <b>dual</b> <b>mounted</b> guns already in use. In 1953, Tan Yang was refitted; all Japanese armaments were removed and replaced with three open air mounted 5"/38 caliber guns, 3"/50 caliber guns replaced the torpedo tubes, Bofors 40 mm guns, and newer depth charge launchers. The Republic of China Navy had no use for the original torpedo tubes as they did not have access to the appropriate armaments.|$|R
5000|$|Soviet {{revolver}} cannon {{are less}} common than Western ones, especially on aircraft. A mechanism for a Soviet revolver-based machine gun was patented in 1944. [...] The virtually unknown Rikhter R-23 was fitted only to some Tu-22 models, but later abandoned {{in favor of}} the two-barrel, Gast gun Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 in the Tu-22M. The Rikhter R-23 does have the distinction of being fired from the space station Salyut 3. The Soviet navy has also adopted a revolver design, the NN-30, typically in a <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> in the AK-230 turret.|$|E
50|$|Further {{extensive}} work {{started in}} April 1937. The six-single mount 8 inch guns were replace by three <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> and re-bored 8 inch guns installed in improved mountings (allowing 55° elevation) with two turrets forward, and one aft, fire control changed, light anti aircraft weapons augmented and eight new 24 inch Type 93 torpedo tubes were installed. Facilities were upgraded for two E7K2 floatplanes. New oil-fired boilers were installed {{and there was}} a general overhaul of machinery. In the light of the added top weight, an attempt was made to maintain stability by increasing the ship's beam - not entirely successfully.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{weapon was}} the 75/34 gun, a {{development}} of the Model 37 divisional gun (34 calibres long), retaining the same dimensions. This weapon had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s; and was normally provided with around 75 rounds of ammunition. Its armour-piercing shells could penetrate roughly 70 mm of armour at 500 meters. For secondary armament, the P 40 had a co-axial machine-gun and another {{which could be used}} in the anti-aircraft role, eschewing the traditional <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> in the hull; the standard ammunition load was also lower, only around 600 rounds, compared to 3,000 of the [...] "M" [...] series.|$|E
50|$|The gun {{system was}} a scale-down {{version of the}} , four 3"/50 caliber Mark 22 guns with two Mark 33 <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> {{controlled}} by a Mark 63 GFCS. Main air-search radar was a OPS-2, Japanese variant of the American AN/SPS-12.|$|R
50|$|The Ayanami {{class were}} the first JMSDF vessels {{equipped}} with six 3-inch/50 caliber Mark 22 guns with Mark 33 <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> and Mark 32 lightweight torpedoes with two Mark 2 over-the-side launchers. 3-inch guns were controlled by two Mark 63 GFCSs.|$|R
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in <b>dual</b> <b>mounts,</b> ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in <b>dual</b> <b>mounts,</b> and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|R
5000|$|After {{emergency}} repairs were completed, Savannah departed Malta on 7 December 1943, {{bound for}} the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard by way of Tunis, Algiers, and Bermuda. She arrived at the Naval Yard on 23 December and underwent heavy repair work for the next eight months. During this period her forward superstructure was remodeled, 4 <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> 5"/38 caliber turrets replaced her eight single open-mount five-inch naval guns and {{a new set of}} up-to-date 20 mm and 40 mm antiaircraft guns were installed. [...] In addition to the new gunnery fit she also received new air-search and surface-search gunnery radars. After this refit she more resembled her half sister , than her Brooklyn-class sister ships.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} subvariants were developed {{after the end}} of World War II. The Caliber [...]50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, M48 Turret Type was developed for the commander's cupola on the M48 Patton tank. The cupola mount on the M48A2 and M48A3 was thoroughly disliked by most tankers, as it proved unreliable in service. An externally mounted M2 was later adopted for the commander's position on the M1 Abrams tanks. Three subvariants were also developed for use by the U.S. Navy on a variety of ships and watercraft. These included the Caliber [...]50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, Soft Mount (Navy) and the Caliber [...]50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, Fixed Type (Navy). The fixed types fire from a solenoid trigger and come in left or right hand feed variants for use on the Mk 56 Mod 0 <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> and other mounts.|$|E
50|$|On 29 October 1940, Yasukuni Maru {{was again}} requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was {{classified}} {{this time as}} an auxiliary submarine tender. She was taken to Kure Naval Arsenal, where her luxurious internal fittings were torn out, and she was repainted gunmetal grey. On 11 January 1941 she {{was assigned to the}} 1st Submarine Division of the IJN 6th Fleet. During the conversion, she was armed with six obsolete 152-mm/50 cal. (6-inch) guns in single mounts and two <b>dual</b> <b>mount</b> Type 93 13.2-mm machine guns and fitted with one 1110-mm and one 900-mm searchlight. During most of the remainder of 1941, Yasukuni Maru was based at Takao in Taiwan for patrols of Ryukyu Islands and the coast of China. However, {{at the time of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, she was based at Kwajalein. On 20 December 1941, she was assigned to the 3rd Submarine Division, still with the IJN 6th Fleet.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{fitted with}} a 40mm cannon aft, Tacoma was re-{{fitted with a}} 20mm for training. In {{addition}} to the <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> for [...]50 caliber machine guns on the O-1 level, there were mounts for twin M-60 machine guns on the O-2 level. Either could be replaced with the Mk 19 grenade launcher.|$|R
50|$|Complete {{and half}} sets of octobans are {{commonly}} mounted in clusters of four, {{in a square}} pattern. Mounts for four drums in a straight line, <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> for two drums, and individual mounts are all also reasonably common. In a drum kit, octobans are most commonly placed {{to the left of}} a right-handed drummer, above the hi-hats.|$|R
50|$|She {{was armed}} with three 12.7 cm SK C/34 naval guns in {{individual}} mountings, four 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns in two <b>dual</b> <b>mounts,</b> and four 2 cm C/30 anti-aircraft guns {{in a single}} quadruple mount. Grille had provisions to carry up to 228 naval mines. The ship had a crew of 248 officers and men.|$|R
5000|$|... 12.8 cm Flakzwilling 40/2 The 12.8 cm Flak 40 {{ordnance}} on {{a static}} <b>dual</b> <b>mounting</b> {{with a total}} weight of 26 tonnes, capable of firing 20 rounds per minute. Used mainly on flak towers. Production started in 1942 with 10 twin sets produced, another eight in 1943, and in February 1945 a total of 34 were available.|$|R

5000|$|From December 1976 to August 1977 {{the ship}} was laid up at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, for {{restructuring}} of her aft section. The 3" [...] 50 calibre <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> were replaced by hangars {{for a pair of}} CH46D SeaKnight helicopters. The ship visited the Brooklyn Navy Yard again in 1980-1981, which saw the installation of a Sea Sparrow missile system and Phalanx CIWS.|$|R

5000|$|Universal <b>Mount</b> - <b>Dual</b> purpose <b>mount,</b> {{fitted with}} wheels {{it could be}} towed by its crew.|$|R
50|$|The {{class was}} armed with two OTO-Melara 76 mm guns for anti-ship and anti-air warfare. They {{were placed in}} single mounts fore and aft. The vessels were also armed with four MM38 Exocet anti-ship {{missiles}} situated in two <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> aft but forward of the rear 76 mm gun. The class was also equipped with two 533 mm torpedo tubes that fired Seal wire-guided torpedoes. The tubes were aft-launching.|$|R
50|$|The gun was a 120 mm dual-purpose {{anti-aircraft}} {{and coastal}} defense gun {{used during the}} World War II. It served as the secondary armament {{on a number of}} Japanese aircraft carriers and cruisers and as the primary armament on smaller ships. Available in both single and <b>dual</b> <b>mounts</b> the gun fired either high explosive or incendiary shrapnel shells that weighed 20.6 kilograms, with a complete round weighing 32.4 kilograms.|$|R
5000|$|A limited-production {{series of}} the Fw 190A fighter and Fw 190F ground attack fighter (which {{utilized}} a particularly strong wing/fuselage design) incorporated two MK 103 cannons, one mounted under each wing in a conformal, gondola-style pod. Later in the war the MK 103 was also used as a ground-based anti-aircraft (AA) weapon, using single or <b>dual</b> <b>mounts.</b> It was also used as a flak autocannon in the Flakpanzer IV [...] "Kugelblitz".|$|R
50|$|Each {{of the two}} Air Defense {{batteries}} {{consists of}} a staff platoon, three Stinger Weapon Platform platoons and a NASAMS 2 Fire Unit (FU). The SWP are available in two variants: The SWP Fennek is a four wheeled armored vehicle with the Aselsan ready to fire a Stinger surface-to-air missile launcher. The Mercedes Benz G290GD four-wheel drive light transport vehicle, with a <b>Dual</b> <b>Mounted</b> Stinger (DMS) on a tripod, offers two Stingers ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|A {{special vehicle}} called the Ontos carried six M40s. A version {{specific}} to the T195E5 mount, the M40A1C, was used. It was used only by the U.S. Marine Corps. Japan produced a self-propelled gun called the Type 60, which carried two side by side. Some Pakistani M113s have a <b>dual</b> <b>mounting.</b> Three Panagopoulos coastal patrol boats class of the Hellenic Coast Guard and the Hellenic Navy in service of 1976-2003 was armed with two sextuples M40.|$|R
50|$|So {{equipment}} of {{this class}} were {{almost the same}} as those of the Akebono, with two American 3"/50 caliber Mark 21 guns (or Type 54, the Japanese version) with two Mark 22 single mounts controlled by Mark 51 director each, four Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns with two <b>dual</b> <b>mounts,</b> a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and eight K-gun depth charge throwers. And in 1959, all Mark 21 guns were replaced by Mark 22 rapid-fire guns with Mark 34 single mounts and Mark 63 GFCS was introduced in exchange of the reduction of Bofors 40 mm guns.|$|R
50|$|The sensor suite and {{weapon system}} {{was almost the}} same as the one of the latter batch of the Ayanami class, but three 5-inch/54 caliber Mark 16 guns (with Mark 39 single mounts) were added to extend {{effective}} range against air and surface threats in addition to four 3-inch/50 caliber Mark 22 guns (with Mark 33 <b>dual</b> <b>mounts).</b> The 5-inch guns were controlled by one Mark 57 GFCS, and the 3-inch guns were done by one Mark 63 controller. The main air-search radar was an OPS-1, the Japanese version of the American AN/SPS-6.|$|R
5000|$|The lMG 08 and LMG 08/15 guns {{would always}} be used on {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, as fixed forward-aimed synchronized firing ordnance initially in single mounts for Germany's 1915-16 era Fokker Eindecker and Halberstadt D.II [...] "scout" [...] single-seat fighters, and by 1916 in <b>dual</b> <b>mounts,</b> first appearing on the mass-produced examples of Robert Thelen's Albatros D.I and D.II fighters in late 1916, and singly on German [...] "C-class" [...] armed two-seat observation aircraft for synchronized forward-firing armament. The usual ammunition load for fighters was for longer, 500 round belts, one for each gun.|$|R
500|$|Similar to {{the fate}} of papers {{relating}} to the Yamato class, most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed to prevent capture {{at the end of the}} war. It is known that the final design of the ships would have had an even greater firepower and size than the Yamato class—a main battery of six [...] guns in three twin turrets and secondary dual purpose armament consisting of twenty-four [...] <b>dual</b> <b>mounted</b> guns (similar to the s). The displacement was to be bigger than the Yamatos, and a side armor belt of [...] was planned.|$|R
500|$|Similar to the {{unfinished}} battleship , Hawaii was {{considered for a}} conversion to be a test platform {{for the development of}} guided missiles in September 1946. Designated CB(SW), the cruisers' gun armament would have consisted of sixteen 3-inch (76mm) L70 guns in eight <b>dual</b> <b>mounts.</b> Most missiles would have been mounted toward the bow, while two [...] "missile launching pits" [...] would be located near the stern. For this task, no armor would have been needed, and previously installed armor was to be taken off the ship when required. These plans never came to fruition, so Hawaii remained in the Reserve Fleet, still incomplete.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the fate}} of papers {{relating}} to the Yamato class, most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed to prevent capture {{at the end of the}} war. It is known that the final design of the ships would have had an even greater firepower and size than the Yamato class—a main battery of six 51 cm guns in three twin turrets and secondary dual purpose armament consisting of twenty-four 10 cm <b>dual</b> <b>mounted</b> guns (similar to the s). The displacement was to be bigger than the Yamatos, and a side armor belt of 46 cm was planned.|$|R
