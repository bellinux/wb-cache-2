500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> to you, nothing I could ever do to make you {{see what you mean}} to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} about the {{residents}} and workers at the fictional Tipton Hotel in Boston and mainly centers around the trouble-making twins, Zack and Cody Martin (Dylan and Cole Sprouse), and London Tipton (Song). The series premiered on the Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, receiving four million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for the Disney Channel in 2005. Critics often praised Song's performance in the Suite Life series. An April 2009 andPOP.com article stated that as London Tipton, [...] "Song is the One to Steal the Spotlight" [...] on the Disney Channel. It said, [...] "if you ever watched an episode of 'The Suite Life with Zack & Cody' you should realize that show is watchable because of one character: London Tipton. Brenda plays the ditzy spoiled hotel heiress London (an allusion to Paris Hilton) and, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> so myself, she does quite an excellent job doing so." [...] While commenting on Song, MSNs 2009 cover story on the series stated, [...] "Song {{is one of the}} main reasons why the [...] "Suite Life" [...] franchise remains one of the most successful and highly rated series in the Disney stable."

500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.|$|E

Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E

500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E
