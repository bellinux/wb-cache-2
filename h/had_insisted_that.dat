5|$|In 1977, {{the title}} {{was used for the}} tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. Although Fleming <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> no film should contain {{anything}} of the plot of the novel, the steel-toothed character of Horror was included, although under the name Jaws.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{took over}} a {{struggling}} institution and rebuilt it {{into one of the}} most prestigious schools for young women in Georgia. She immediately went to work improving its academic standards, beautifying the physical plant, and increasing enrollment.

5|$|Following Bowie's death, fans {{gathered}} at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows {{him in his}} Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not want}} a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January.|$|E

5|$|On November 19, 2003 {{he signed}} a one-year, $1.73 million {{contract}} with the Indians {{in order for the}} Indians to avoid salary arbitration with him. During spring training, he was banned from the Indians' training camp after not running out a popup a game earlier. On April 3, 2004, he was traded to the Dodgers for Franklin Gutiérrez and a player to be named later (Andrew Brown); the Akron Beacon Journal later reported that manager Eric Wedge <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Bradley be traded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure who}} really drove the project forward was Herbert Morrison, the Labour Party politician. He it was who <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Matthew had Martin as his deputy architect, {{treating}} the Festival Hall {{as a special}} project.|$|E
25|$|TIGRIS' Worblaufen {{facility}} {{is said to}} be a violation of Swiss law since it was said to be using Swiss military facilities when a reply to the Federal Assembly <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> TIGRIS and the military police do not share any building facilities.|$|E

25|$|Black {{leaders in}} the North <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Republican Party National {{platform}} for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation.

25|$|The second {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with conventional propellers and flown by Hughes on 5 April 1947, {{after he had}} recuperated from his injuries. Initially, the USAAF <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Hughes {{not be allowed to}} fly the aircraft, but after a personal appeal to Generals Ira Eaker and Carl Spaatz, he was allowed to do so against posting of $5 million in security.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed in}} December 1918 {{with a view to}} commissioning a war memorial for the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, who lost 6,866 men in the First World War. After settling on a reduced-scale version of the Whitehall cenotaph, the committee commissioned Lutyens to design it. Whereas Lutyens <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> his Stone of Remembrance should never be reduced in size, it appears he was happy to design a two-thirds-scale cenotaph.|$|E

50|$|The EU <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it {{will not}} {{recognise}} any changes to the 1967 borders other than those agreed between the parties. Israel's settlement program has therefore led to some tensions, and EU states consider these settlements illegal under international law.|$|R
25|$|On 6 July 2013, Prescott {{revealed}} {{in a newspaper}} column that he had resigned from the Privy Council in protest against the delays {{to the introduction of}} press regulation. The resignation only became effective on 6 November the same year. The Coalition Government <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Privy Council must consider a cross-party Royal Charter to underpin a new system of regulation, but that this meant that a final decision would not be taken before 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Roush Racing owner Jack Roush {{planned to}} sign Gordon, but Gordon's {{stepfather}} John Bickford <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Roush hire Ray Evernham; due to Roush's policy of hiring his own crew chiefs, Bickford declined. Later in the year, Rick Hendrick watched Gordon race in a Busch Series event at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and Gordon joined Hendrick Motorsports two days later. Gordon made his Winston Cup {{debut in the}} season-ending race, the Hooters 500 at Atlanta, finishing 31st after a crash.|$|E
25|$|When the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States asked Boeing to do tests {{activating}} {{the thrust}} reverser in flight, the FAA had allowed Boeing {{to establish the}} tests of the thrust reverser. Boeing <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> a deployment was not possible in flight. In 1982 Boeing established a test where the aircraft was slowed to 250 knots, and the test pilots then used the thrust reverser. The control of the aircraft had not been jeopardized. The FAA accepted {{the results of the}} test.|$|E

25|$|The Castle Bravo {{incident}} itself {{raised a}} number of questions about the survivability of a nuclear war. Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously radioactive by-products of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.|$|E
25|$|In the mid twentieth century, the Irish {{government}} {{introduced a}} rule stating that all air traffic between Ireland and the United States must transit through Shannon Airport. In return, the United States government placed {{a limit of}} four airports in the US that Aer Lingus could operate to. On 22 March 2007, the Open skies agreement between the US and EU was ratified. This resulted in the immediate cancellation of the long-running 'Shannon Stopover' requirement, whereby the Irish government <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> 50% of all transatlantic flights between Ireland and the United States must pass through Shannon Airport.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt nationalized {{unemployment}} relief through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), headed by close friend Harry Hopkins. Roosevelt <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the projects {{had to be}} costly in terms of labor, long-term beneficial, and the WPA was forbidden to compete with private enterprises (therefore the workers had to be paid smaller wages). The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created to return the unemployed to the work force. The WPA financed a variety of projects such as hospitals, schools, and roads, and employed more than 8.5million workers who built 650,000 miles of highways and roads, 125,000 public buildings, as well as bridges, reservoirs, irrigation systems, parks, playgrounds and so on.|$|E
