The study was conducted at a commercial broiler chicken farm (Distract Jianxi, Luoyang, Henan, China). The selected 384 1 -day-old male broiler chicks (Arbor Acres) were obtained from a local hatchery (Xinan hatchery, Luoyang, Henan, China) and randomly divide into 8 treatments with 8 replicate pens of 6 broiler chickens per pen based on the initial body weight (P >  0.05). All the birds were housed <b>in</b> multi-tiered <b>brooder</b> <b>cages</b> placed <b>in</b> a climate-controlled room for {{the experimental}} period of 21 day. The house temperature was maintained at 35  °C during the first week, and it was reduced 2  °C per week until reaching the temperature of 24  ±  1  °C. Eighteen hours of lighting were provided per day throughout the duration of the experiment, apart from day 1 to 7 when 23  h of lighting were provided. The broiler chickens were provided access to feed and water ad libitum. Each pen was equipped with a separate feeder and a manual drinker.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} productivity of the final hybrids laying type of hens Isa Brown and Bovans Brown in different housing systems {{on the basis of}} data provided by the International Poultry Testing Station in Ústrašice. Monitoring performance of the final hybrid laying type hens consisted of rearing pullets until the age of 126 days and the laying period to 518 days of age. Hatching eggs of Isa Brown hybrid for keeping <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> had significantly higher weight and fertilization, but lower hatchability of fertilized eggs than for keeping on litter. Hybrid Bovans Brown eggs for hatching intended for keeping <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> had lower weight and lower fertilization and hatching rate of fertilized eggs than eggs for keeping on litter. At the end of 18 th week of rearing of pullets Isa Brown and Bovans Brown reared <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> had significantly lower body weight compared to pullets reared on litter. In pullets housed <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> feed consumption <b>in</b> 126 days was significantly higher compared with pullets reared on litter. During the rearing of pullets mortality was not recorded. Hybrid Isa Brown showed a higher body weight if kept <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> while hybrid Bovans Brown on litter. Both hybrids <b>in</b> battery <b>cages</b> had lower feed consumption per 1 egg and 1 feeding day. For the observed period was found higher mortality in chickens kept <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> than on litter. Hens housed <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> had lower egg production at the initial state.

30|$|The {{results of}} {{technical}} inefficiency model indicate that farmers {{experience and the}} number of production cycles were negatively related to technical inefficiency of finfish <b>cage</b> culture <b>in</b> the study areas. This imply that technical inefficiencies of cage farms could be reduced significantly through increasing the number of production cycle. The slow growth of grouper <b>in</b> <b>cage</b> farms has been identified as the main difficulty to increase production in Malaysia and other countries in South East Asia. The growth of grouper depends on the type of seed, feed and feeding practices <b>in</b> <b>cage</b> culture. Farmers mainly use trash fish due to low cost and locally available feed for grouper compared to pelleted feed. It is generally believed that feeding trash fish can improve the texture and appearance of the fish that can fetch high market value. The results reveal that farmers experience is lacking <b>in</b> <b>cage</b> culture activities. Improving skills <b>in</b> <b>cage</b> culture management will reduce the inefficiency of <b>cage</b> farms <b>in</b> Malaysia. Study found that farmers have lack of knowledge and skills in the daily care and feeding activities required <b>in</b> <b>cage</b> culture <b>in</b> Indonesia (Ahmad and Sunyoto 1990).|$|R

Broilers reared in litter pens were sig-nificantly heavier (P<. 05) than the <b>caged</b> broilers <b>in</b> Experiments 1 and 2. Broilers reared on plastic mats had significantly more (P<. 05) swollen feather follicles than did broilers reared in litter pens or on rubber mats. The occurrence of abnormal legs was approximately equal among the live broil-ers reared <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> or <b>in</b> litter pens. There were significantly more (P<. 05) processed broilers with missing skin on the breast for broilers reared in litter pens than <b>in</b> <b>cages</b> <b>in</b> Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1.
