50|$|The {{publishing}} {{section was}} established in 1948 to invigorate the organization’s publishing activities. S. S. Shleymovich {{was the first to}} head it. In 1968, as the amount of publications by the USSR AS Karelian Branch grew substantially, the publishing section was transformed into the Editorial and Publishing Department (EPD). In 1971 the EPD became authorized to publish the journal of proceedings of the Karelian Branch. In 1973 the <b>instant</b> <b>printing</b> <b>shop</b> was set up to publish collected volumes and monographic books without having to engage external book publishers. The number of limited circulation editions (express publication of research results, pre-prints of conference papers and abstracts, etc.) increased remarkably. In 1992 the Editorial and Publishing Department and the <b>instant</b> <b>printing</b> <b>shop</b> were merged into one unit to promote the efficiency of their operation. The time period from manuscript submission to final product became much shorter, the entire publishing process was optimized. A new phase in EPD development started in the 1990s with the onset of the computer era. Technical facilities of the editorial group were updated. Layout and design were computerized. Through renovation of the publishing process the quality of the printed products was notably improved, their volumes enlarged and the preparation and production cycle shortened. The EPD now implements the entire book publishing cycle. The principal concern for the EPD is to produce its editions so that they meet all modern standards.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{abstract}} is to document and explain an exhibition of photographic art work using the now extinct Kodak <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film. The exhibition resulted from using what were probably the last 100 unexposed pieces of Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film available in Southern California, and possibly the last available in the country. The exhibition took place April 3 - 10, 1987 in the North Art Gallery of California State University, Northridge. The imagery in this exhibition evolved from my interest in working with the immediate feedback associated with exposing and manipulating Polaroid SX- 70 and Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film...|$|R

50|$|Another {{major change}} for the SWP was the selling of its <b>print</b> <b>shop</b> in 2004 as the {{enterprise}} was {{no longer able to}} win an adequate degree of commercial work to supplement the group's own printing requirements; it had printed Private Eye, the Morning Star, and other publications. Built in the early 1970s the <b>print</b> <b>shop</b> had originally been established in 1968 when Socialist Worker first appeared. SWP publications are now printed by commercial printers with the result that their appearance has undergone a great improvement. However it should not be ignored that the <b>print</b> <b>shop</b> had helped to subsidise the SWP's own publications and {{it has been suggested that}} the sale of the <b>print</b> <b>shop</b> was the result of a crisis in the group's finances.|$|R

To prevent the neighbors from discovering {{the true nature of the}} <b>print</b> <b>shop,</b> they were told that the business was a small travel agency that had their own press needs confirmation. [...] Each issue of the magazine was between 28 and 32 pages, cost between 25 and 50 cents (including postage), and was distributed to news organizations, activists, and subscribers. [...] Once the initial distribution was completed, the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee would reprint the magazine for a wider circulation.|$|R
