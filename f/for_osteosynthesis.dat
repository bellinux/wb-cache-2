40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the state of}} the art and recent developments and advances in the use of degradable polymers devices <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis.</b> The current generation of biodegradable polymeric implants for bone repair utilising designs copied from metal implants, originates from the concept that devices should be supportive and as “inert ” substitute to bone tissue. Today degradable polymeric devices <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> are successful in low or mild load bearing applications. However, the lack of carefully controlled randomized prospective trials that document their efficacy in treating a particular fracture pattern is still an issue. Then, the choice between degradable and non-degradable devices must be carefully weighed and depends on many factors such as the patient age and condition, the type of fracture, the risk of infection, etc. The improvement of the biodegradable devices mechanical properties and their degradation behaviour will have to be achieved to broaden their use. The next generation of biodegradable implants will probably see the implementation of the recent gained knowledge in cell-material interactions and cells therapy, with a better control of the spatial and temporal interfaces between the material and the surrounding bone tissue...|$|E

Re-analysis of preoperative imaging could not verify objective differences regarding cortical destruction, scalloping, and lesion size between both groups. Comparability of osteosynthesis and non-osteosynthesis cases, however, was limited by the retrospective study design and the small group size with a potential selection bias as more complicated lesions might have been selected <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis.</b>|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} the use of an Ilizarov fixator {{combined}} with FIN in treating a postoperative pseudarthrosis of the femur in a patient with severe OI (recessive form of OI, type VIII) provided longitudinal, rotational and angular stability. This approach ensured early functional activity and full weight-bearing, both favourable conditions for bone tissue regeneration. We should emphasize that the external fixator was applied for a short period only and for additional stability and not for progressive deformity correction or other manipulation. The combination of intramedullary and subperiosteal nailing together with subperiosteal titanium nickel mesh also seems to be promising <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> in deformity correction of small diameter bones in children with OI.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Forty-nine skeletally mature {{patients}} who had either a non-union or a malunion of a fracture of the tibia or the femur had correction of the deform-ity and acute axial lengthening of the fractured bone.

At an average of sixty-three months (range, twenty-six to 105 months), the average increase in the tibial and femoral length was 1. 7 and 3. 2 centimeters, respectively. There were no compart-ment syndromes or ischemia secondary to any of the procedures. One patient had a transient sensory-nerve loss.

40|$|BOP (biocompatible osteoconductive polymer) is a {{material}} proposed <b>for</b> <b>osteosyntheses</b> and <b>for</b> filling of bone defects in orthopaedics, neurosurgery and stomatology. It {{is a composite}} made of a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone and methylmethacrylate, of polyamide- 6 fibers and of calcium gluconate. The histological investigation includes the study- of 30 intact rabbit femurs instrumented with a BOP rod, {{as well as the}} study of organs of the reticuloendothelial system. The currently available results show the absence of toxicity on hematopoietic tissue. Zones of osteoblastic activity surround the rods, coupled with an osteoclastic reaction which may result in the partial fragmentation of the polyamide fibers and its incorporation in the newly formed bone. We also observed the encapsulation of the material. The biomechanical approach investigated the mechanical properties of the material in bending and in shear. The radiological aspects of the investigation consisted of computerized axial tomography of the implanted femurs to measure density at the bone-implant interface.

40|$|Background - For dose {{reduction}} actions, {{the principle}} of “image quality as good as possible” to “image quality as good as needed” requires {{to know whether the}} physical measures and visual image quality relate. Visual evaluation and objective physical measures of image quality can appear to be different. If there is no noticeable effect on the visual image quality with a low dose but there is a objective physical measure impact, then the overall dose may be reduced without compromising the diagnostic image quality. Low dose imaging can be used for certain types of observations, e. g. thoracic scoliosis, control after metal implantation <b>for</b> <b>osteosynthesis,</b> reviewing pneumonia and tuberculosis.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to characterise the {{influence}} of heat treatment on the degradation behaviour and stability of degradable magnesium based implants. For this purpose two groups (untreated/ heat treated) of LAE 442 pins were separately analysed in an in vitro and in vivo study. The corrosion behaviour was evaluated during 8 weeks degradation in SBF (in vitro) and 48 weeks degradation intramedullary in the rabbit tibia (in vivo). The analyses were made by using μ-computed tomography and three-point-bending tests. Heat treatment led to altered mechanical and corrosion properties of LAE 442. While the initial stability declined significantly a reduction of the degradation rate over either in vitro and in vivo evaluation period is determined.
