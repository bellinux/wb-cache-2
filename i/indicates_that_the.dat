5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E

30|$|In this research, {{sunrise and}} sunset {{were defined as}} the times when {{the center of the}} Sun {{appeared}} above the horizon at dawn and dusk, respectively.

The sunrise/sunset reference time was defined as the difference between the sunrise/sunset time in UT at each station at 100 km in altitude and the event time. For ΔT_sr(STN), negative values <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> station was in darkness, while positive values <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> station was in sunlight.

5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
