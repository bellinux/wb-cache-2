5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, McGovern {{decided to}} run for the U.S.Senate and {{challenge}} the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite. The race centered mostly around rural issues, but John F. Kennedy's Catholicism was a drawback {{at the top of the}} ticket in the mostly Protestant state. McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, [...] "It was my worst campaign. I hated [...] so much <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> sense of balance." [...] McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt's 160,579, but the margin was one-third of Kennedy's loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state's presidential contest.|$|E

[...] The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> baby."

500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and the yearning for a long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, [...] "Dope" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock lament, in the vein of Irish folk ballad rue. Rolling Stone said that [...] "Dope" [...] reveals a [...] "dark mood" [...] of Gaga as she plays {{the piano and}} utters the lyrics. She begins the song with intoxicated, slur-like vocals and the lines, [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> only friend". The composition and the musical elements associated with the track resembled Gaga's own song, [...] "Hair", from Born This Way (2011) with its contemplative nature, and singer Rihanna's 2013 single, [...] "Stay", with the piano driven melody and the powerful vocals. It is more like theatrical music, but devoid of any genre. There is not much instrumentation accompanying the singer's vocals, except for piano sounds and distant synths, making Gaga's singing {{the focal point of}} [...] "Dope". In order to give the production an intimate feeling and make it emotional, Rubin did not apply any pitch correction to Gaga's vocals, as noted by Jon Pareles from The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E

500|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2008/2009 season {{by winning the}} Northern Ireland Trophy, {{defeating}} Dave Harold 9–3 in the final. O'Sullivan is the only player to win back-to-back ranking events {{in the last four}} years. He then reached the final of the Shanghai Masters, having defeated Stephen Maguire in the semi–finals with two the top breaks of 141 and 145. However, in the final, he was defeated 10–8 by qualifier Ricky Walden. O'Sullivan was leading, but Walden pulled back four frames in a row to win the match. In the Premier League, he secured a 7–2 win over Mark Selby, which meant that he had won the event eight times in total, and five times consecutively. However, O'Sullivan failed to defend his UK Championship title, losing to Joe Perry 5–9 in the second round. O'Sullivan had conceded the twelfth game of the match to go 5–7 down, although Perry held a lead of only 23 points to zero. Commenting afterwards, O'Sullivan said [...] "It might have looked like <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> head or whatever, but I'm sure I'll bounce back." [...] For this he was later fined £300, and was ordered to pay £1,000 in costs.|$|E

[...] The Quietus states that the song [...] "makes you realise the ocean means a lot more to this songwriter than the reference to Ocean's Eleven that he's cited in interviews, he is mysterious and tragic." [...] Yahoo! Music stated that [...] "in his calm, ultra controlled tone, Ocean sings about feeling like he's on his way to a funeral as he drives around town in a black suit, and a body in the trunk." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansfield {{became an}} {{inspiration}} for musicians in the punk rock genre. The Mansfields are a punk band who took their name from the actress and released titles [...] "Jayne's Laugh" [...] and [...] "Jayne Mansfield Was A Punk". St. Jayne, a punk band from Cleveland, Ohio was also named after her. Another band of the genre called itself Jane Mansfield's Head in 1980s. In 1989, the band L.A. Guns released [...] "The Ballad of Jayne" [...] {{and the next year}} the cyberpunk band Sigue Sigue Sputnik released [...] "Hey Jane Mansfield Superstar!". Masons, punk band form Tucson, Arizona, toured in 2000 playing three songs dedicated to her—"Bombshell," [...] "Crash My Car" [...] and [...] "The Witch." [...] The Motors, a British pub rock/punk band, had their billboard campaign <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> head over The Motors, which featured a picture of Jayne Mansfield, banned. German punk band The Bates has recorded a tune called [...] "The Lips of Jayne Mansfield," [...] featured in the 1990 album Shake. The Dave Brothers, a punk rock band in the late 1990s had a Sunday show on radio station KRCL (106 FM, later taken over by KCGL) called the Church of Jayne Mansfield and distributed her posters for promotion.|$|E

[...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me.
