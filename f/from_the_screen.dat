5|$|The game {{also offers}} {{objectives}} {{to be accomplished}} over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing three or more rows at once.

5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E
5|$|After Grant retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> {{he became}} more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Faberg√©. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E

5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
