Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> {{found guilty}} of an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 a NIH report {{concluded}} that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese. In the 1990s the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set. This became the definitive guide for determining <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> overweight.|$|E
25|$|Note: The table takes dual {{responses}} (for example <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> French-Canadian he/she {{would be}} added to both French and Canadian). Some places of one's ethnic origin do not refer to a single specified country of origin, i.e. Spanish refers to people from Spanish speaking countries such as Colombia, Argentina, Cuba and others; or East Indian where the respondents origin could be from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, etc.; and the list contains about 200 nationalities known to reside in the province. However, there are options for the respondent to identify the country alone.|$|E

25|$|Every Yemenite Jew {{knew how}} to read from the Torah Scroll with the correct {{pronunciation}} and tune, exactly right in every detail. Each man who was called up to the Torah read his section by himself. All this was possible because children {{right from the start}} learned to read without any vowels. Their diction is much more correct than the Sephardic and Ashkenazic dialect. The results of their education are outstanding, for example <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> speaking with his neighbor and needs to quote a verse from the Bible, he speaks it out by heart, without pause or effort, with its melody.|$|E
25|$|Zanfona (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, {{with three}} melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older {{examples}} had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually {{tuned to the}} key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the bordonciño in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the bordón in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the bordonciño (this string was sometimes known as the human voice, because it sounds as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> humming the melody an octave lower).|$|E

500|$|In a split decision, the Supreme Court {{declined}} {{to overturn the}} state court's conclusion about custody {{because it was not}} objectively incorrect. The Court noted that there was no precedent that required the use of age in determining whether someone is in police custody (this would change in 2011 with J.D.B. v. North Carolina, which held that age is relevant to determining <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> in custody). [...] The case has been cited in subsequent Supreme Court decisions as precedent for providing state courts with latitude in making decisions about general or broad rules.|$|E
500|$|... b2. It {{is related}} in some gospels {{that a woman}} was {{condemned}} by the Jews because of a sin and {{was taken to the}} customary place of stoning, in order that she might be stoned.

And no one dared to do so. [...] When they examined themselves and they recognized that they too bore responsibility for certain actions, they did not dare to stone her.

500|$|LaVey {{rejects the}} idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists {{to take action to}} fix a {{situation}} instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of [...] "controlled selfishness", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from [...] "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" [...] to [...] "Do unto others as they do unto you" [...] so that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. The Book of Lucifer also contains a list of [...] "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" [...] (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven [...] "Infernal Names", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.|$|E

500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Beauty Pageant" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 90-second clip, April seeks beauty contestant advice from Leslie, who tells her to act differently from her usual behavior. While awaiting the talent contest, April lists a number of her unusual talents, including inventing emoticons, convincing her mother she is adopted, instantly making security guards suspicious and determining <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> fat or pregnant [...] "with 60 percent accuracy". In the second 1-minute and 15 second clip, Ann tries to explain to Mark she is not hinting at sex when she asks him to [...] "fix her shower", and Sanderson talks about his insecurities, including that Leslie might be too smart for him. In the final 90-second clip, Tom expresses anger that the swimsuit competition {{has been removed from}} the contest, and tries to convince the judges to reinstate it during their deliberations.|$|E
500|$|For an offer, such as [...] "you may use my car {{whenever}} you like", {{the consequence of}} compliance [...] "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer {{of the use of}} the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> threatened with [...] "your money or your life", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.|$|E
500|$|British pop {{and soul}} singer Jahméne Douglas {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Titanium" [...] on July 22, 2013 {{as the lead}} single from his debut studio album, Love Never Fails (2013). Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. I was scared {{to do it because}} it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. The music video shows Douglas next to a piano, while a story of domestic abuse plays out.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of drug-related {{activities}} in northern Mexico and in Tamaulipas, many Facebook users also check Valor por Tamaulipas to verify if there is a shootout in their area, to know in what part of a highway a carjacking took place, or to see <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> reported missing. The information found at Valor por Tamaulipas is shared by Internet users themselves; the administrator, on the other hand, was active almost all hours during the day and throughout the whole week. Most of the Mexican mainstream media outlets play down the violence because they fear reprisals from the country's criminal organizations. Given the censorship, Valor por Tamaulipas was a popular outlet for crime watchdogs concerned with the violence in Tamaulipas. According to crime journalist James Barger from InSight Crime, the information in Valor por Tamaulipas is [...] "spotty, sometimes unreliable, but often the only source of what [...] happening". Several Internet users in Mexico, the United States, and in other countries around the world have shown their support for Valor por Tamaulipas' work and have followed their reports on Facebook and/or Twitter.|$|E
500|$|Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and {{misogyny}} through Kilgrave's {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Smile", calling the season [...] "the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique" [...] from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to [...] "similar well-meaning scenarios [...] play out {{in the real world}} time and again each day" [...] many in the form of gendered street harassment, that resonates with many women. Hill also added that [...] "Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent," [...] due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that [...] "Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise." [...] Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that [...] "powerlessness is not gendered." ...|$|E
500|$|Garland and VFX {{supervisor}} Jon Thum began {{developing the}} Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect {{to replicate the}} visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long {{it could be used}} before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, [...] "You see a whale or a shark breach the water...then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by...how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [...] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time." [...] He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: [...] "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." [...] Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design.|$|E
