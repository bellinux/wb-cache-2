40|$|The four Cichlidogyrus species (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae) {{found on}} the gills of Sarotherodon mvogoi and Tylochromis sudanensis (Teleostei, Cichlidae) in Cameroon are {{considered}} new and are described herein. Cichlidogyrus mvogoi n. sp. from Sarotherodon mvogoi, characterised by a long (> 100 mu m), thin and spirally coiled penis and a short marginal hook pair I. Cichlidogyrus sigmocirrus n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by a short marginal hook pair I, a slightly spirally coiled penis with reduced heel, an accessory piece being a spirally coiled band wrapped round the penis and attached to the penis basal bulb by a very thin filament. Cichlidogyrus chrysopiformis n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by an marginal hook pair I of medium size, a thin spirally coiled penis (1. 5 turn) with a developed <b>flared</b> <b>heel,</b> an accessory piece being a large gutter shaped band, ending in a narrow complex extremity, and linked to the basal bulb of the penis by a very thin filament, a short, straight and slightly ringed vagina. Cichlidogyrus djietoi n. sp. from Tylochromis sudanensis, characterised by a slightly spirally coiled penis (2 turns) with developed heel, an accessory piece being a large gutter shaped band, ending in a narrow folded back extremity, a short funnel shaped vagina. The three latter species are also remarkable by the morphology of their auricles implanted on the anterior side of the dorsal transverse bar which make them (together with the other species described from Tylochromis hosts) a homogeneous and original group within Cichlidogyrus, this distinctive feature seems to be ancestral compared to other Cichlidogyrus species...|$|E

40|$|Objectives This {{meta-analysis}} {{investigated the}} efficacies of foot orthoses, motion control footwear and therapeutic adhesive taping in controlling foot pronation {{as compared with}} no-intervention conditions. Data sources Electronic searches on four electronic databases were performed and the reference lists of the screened articles were also scrutinised. Review methods Two reviewers screened the quasirandomised or clinical controlled trials that examined {{the efficacy of the}} selected interventions in controlling calcaneal eversion. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed by I 2 index and Egger's regression intercept, respectively. Trial quality was rated by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results 29 studies were selected. The I 2 indices revealed large heterogeneity which supported the use of a random effect model of meta-analysis. The Egger's regression intercepts suggested that publication bias of the included studies was marginally present in the motion control footwear and the therapeutic adhesive taping groups (p= 0. 06 - 0. 07). All three interventions were effective in reducing calcaneal eversion (p< 0. 001) with therapeutic adhesive taping being most effective whereas Low-dye taping was less effective than the other taping techniques, such as high-dye and stirrups taping. Custom-made foot orthoses were more effective than prefabricated orthoses. Motion control footwear with <b>heel</b> <b>flare</b> or wedge design was less effective than those with dual midsole materials. Conclusions Foot orthoses, motion control footwear and therapeutic adhesive taping were able to control rearfoot eversion with therapeutic adhesive taping being the most effective. In the clinical practice, selection of an antipronation intervention should be based on patient characteristics, type of activity and personal preference. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Styles' time in One Direction, in website AllMusic writer Tim Sendra opined his [...] "charming persona and elastic vocals had him {{positioned}} as the Timberlake of the group." [...] Styles seemed [...] "a dimpled, rakish prankster happy {{to wear the}} mantle of Class Clown... maybe {{because he knew that}} Most Likely to Succeed belonged to him too," [...] as noted by Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt. During public appearances, Styles' fashion evolution has traded [...] "teen-friendly" [...] Jack Wills tracksuits for a selection of Saint Laurent, Gucci and Burberry. As his time in the band progressed, the singer started wearing skinny-jean-and-boots. For Billboards Chris Payne, [...] "From his influences to his fashion to his onstage persona to his (formerly) flowing locks, Styles' vibe has always screamed rock star." [...] The same publication noted over the course of five-year stint with his group, Styles' taste in fashion [...] "has blossomed from a teen wearing purple Jack Wills hoodies to a carefully executed blend of 70s rock with a glamorous magpie feel." [...] In September 2016 Styles was featured in three separate editorial shoots, and was interviewed by Paul McCartney and Chelsea Handler, for Another Man magazine prompting the Guardian to label the event as the death of a 'heartthob' and birth of an 'artthrob'.Promoting his solo projects during 2017, Styles opted for [...] "candyfloss" [...] pink suits, printed satin <b>flares,</b> gradually heightening <b>heels,</b> a style described as [...] "flamboyant look." [...] Regarding his favoritism for pink, he quoted The Clash's Paul Simonon in an interview: [...] "Pink is the only true rock & roll colour." ...|$|R
