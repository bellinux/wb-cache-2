40|$|Abstract. Rice husk ash (RHA) is {{the product}} of rice husk {{pyrolysis}} or combustion, which contains <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> in original rice husk and non-converted fixed carbon. Due to large amounts of inherent silicon dioxide in rice husk, the decarbonized residue of RHA has great value as industrial materials. One basic method to remove carbon from RHA is roasting. Because of low carbon content in RHA and low roasting reaction velocity, the roasting process takes a long time. In this case, fixed-bed roasting is suitable for removing carbon from RHA. In the present work, experimental study on RHA decarbonization is conducted based on a specially-designed multi-section fixed-bed roasting. The experimental results show that under the experimental conditions, the flame propagation spread of RHA in fixed beds is in the range 0. 833 to 0. 121 mm/s. The results documented in this paper provide the basis for further developing large-scale engineering devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{superheated}} steam fluidized bed dryer (SSFBD) in a self-heat recuperative configuration {{has a great}} potential of improving thermal efficiency of a lignite-fired power plant by recovering both of latent heat of vaporization of water kept in the fuel and part of sensible heat during the fuel processing. However, the optimal design of the dryer requires the fundamental knowledge of drying characteristics in respect to the individual properties of the utilized fuel. Experimental investigation to determine the correlation between a specific coal properties originated from geological background and its drying characteristics is thus the major concern in this paper. The investigated lignite is a representative of Turoszow deposit in Poland. Experimental attempts unveiling drying kinetics were carried out for 5 mm and 10 mm diameter spherical samples in the {{superheated steam}} atmosphere in the temperature range of 110 °C– 170 °C. Simultaneous and continuous measurements of changes in weight, surface and interior temperatures and appearance on each tested sample were carried out for describing drying behavior. Analytical investigation was applied to explain the drying characteristics, which are strongly affected by the individual properties of coal and the <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> composition...|$|E
40|$|Ash-related {{problems}} including deposition, slagging, Fouling, sintering, and agglomeration, caused {{during the}} operation of biomass gasifiers and combustors using various agroresidues, e. g., wheat straw, olive residue, corn cobs, as feedstocks constitute the limiting factor for a broad use {{of this kind of}} biomass materials for energy production via thermochemical conversion methods. Ash content minimization and simultaneous removal of a number of so-called troublesome elements, e. g., potassium, sodium, chlorine, sulfur, from the ash fraction of these materials were performed by two different pretreatment techniques, fractionation and leaching. Fractionation appeared to remove in all cases a large amount of the material's <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> fraction but resulted in a deterioration {{of the quality of the}} remaining ash. On the other hand, leaching resulted in both removal of a large portion of the material's inorganic fraction and an improvement of the quality of the remaining ash by removing to a large extent the so-called troublesome elements causing problems during the thermochemical conversion of biomass. Furthermore, ash thermal behavior of various untreated and pretreated samples using sintering tests performed in a laboratory muffle furnace in combination with SEM-EDX elemental analyses of the thermally treated ash samples was studied. In most cases, the results from the thermal treatment technique appeared to be in good agreement with the results obtained from the ash elemental analyses of the tested samples.

40|$|Recirculation of {{wood ash}} from energy {{production}} to forest soil improves {{the sustainability of}} this energy production form as recycled wood ash contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t wood ash ha- 1. We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria, Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha- 1 to alkaline at 167 t ha- 1. Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha- 1 followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha- 1 wood ash. The soil bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha- 1 while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash dose of 167 t ha- 1 with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha- 1 whereas {{this was not the}} case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of wood <b>ash</b> <b>inherent</b> nutrients...|$|R
40|$|Pulverized {{samples of}} Utah bituminous, Beulah (North Dakota) low Na lignite, Beulah high Na lignite and Texas (San Miguel) lignite coals were burned {{at a rate}} of 2. 5 kg/hr in a {{laboratory}} furnace under various (overall fuel lean) combustion conditions. Particle size distributions (PSD) and size segregated particle filter samples were taken at various positions within the convection section. Temperature and gas concentrations were measured throughout. The evolution of the submicron PSD within the convection section for the four coals was similar, although the location of the initial particle mode at the convection section inlet varied with coal type. While staged (. 8 / 1. 2) combustion of the Utah bituminous coal had a variable effect on the volume of submicron aerosol produced, staged combustion of two of the three lignites (Beulah low Na and Texas) caused a definite increase in the submicron aerosol volume. Vapor enhancement due to a localized reducing atmosphere, which would effect coals of higher ash volatility or higher <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> content, is thought to explain this behavior. Depressed combustion temperatures associated with the high moisture content of the Beulah high Na lignite are thought to offset the effects of staging. Increased combustion temperatures (through oxygen enrichment) caused staged volume increases for the Beulah high Na lignite. Combustion temperatures are a controlling factor even at more extreme staging conditions. Chemical analysis of the size segregated particle samples show the trace elements, As, Pb, Zn and the major elements, Na and K to be enriched in the submicron aerosol. Auger depth profiles show these small particles to be comprised of a core enriched in Fe, Si, Ca and Mg and surface layers enriched in Na and K. These results point to a mechanism of homogeneous nucleation of low vapor pressure species followed by successive layering of progressively more volatile species. Volatile species are enriched in the submicron aerosol due to the large surface areas provided. Modeling efforts show that while coagulation may be the dominant mechanism to describe the aerosol evolving within the convection section, it cannot be used solely to predict the PSD. Another mechanism, presumably surface area dependent growth (condensation) must be included...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Sodium in coal {{has been}} {{associated}} with the fouling of heat transfer surfaces of boilers for many years even though its role has not been understood in detail. Currently, a theoretical and experimental study has been undertaken to investigate the reactions and reaction mechanisms of sodium with sulphur species and with inherent silica and kaolin during coal combustion and the cooling of the combustion gases. The dependence of these reactions on the form of the sodium in the coal and the combustion temperature has also been assessed. The experimental investigations involved combusting synthetic coals in which the concentrations, the size and the distribution of the inorganic constituents were controlled. These coals were prepared by adding into a slurry of demineralised Loy Yang brown coal, known quantities of inorganic constituents - sodium as a solution of sodium chloride or sodium acetate and as required, size graded silica or kaolin. The slurry was dried, pulverised and sieved to obtain the 63 - 90 μm size fraction used in the experiments. The coals were combusted in a drop tube furnace and the supra micron product ash was collected in a heated cyclone, upstream of a filter to collect the submicron condensed sodium salts. As well as coal composition, other experimental variables examined, were the furnace wall temperatures of 1000 °C, 1200 °C and 1400 °C, coal feed rates of 5. 5 g/h and 2. 7 g/h, position and temperature at which the reaction products were quenched and collected, and the addition of gaseous sulphur dioxide with the secondary air equivalent to 3 % sulphur in the dry coal. The collected ash was analysed by wet chemical methods, examined by electron microscope and sized by a Malvern laser diffraction particle size analyser. The experimental program included the determination of coal particle temperatures by combusting a synthetic coal with <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> which was stable under combustion conditions and had a sharp melting point. The data from these experiments was used as input to a combustion model to establish the char reactivity which was then used in the same model to predict combustion parameters for the range of conditions employed in the other experiments. The experiments to investigate the reactions of sodium chloride with sulphur oxides in combustion gases, showed that below 1000 °C, the sulphation of sodium chloride was kinetically limited for times which are normally available in p. c. fired boilers. For temperatures above 1100 °C, the extent of sulkphation was found to be greater than that predicted at the thermodynamic equilibrium for the overall system, possibly due to the formation of the radicals NaSO₂ and NaSO₃ during combustion. From the experiments to study the reactions of sodium with silica, it was found that sodium silicates formed almost exclusively during coal combustion, probably due to the progressive agglomeration and coalescence of the ash reducing the surface of silica available for reaction. The rate of silicate formation increased with temperature but this was largely offset by a parallel reduction in combustion time, resulting in only small changes in the extent of formation with temperature. Generally, the extent of silicate formation was greatest at 1200 °C and least at 1000 °C. The presence of chlorine and to a much lesser extent sulphur, reduced the formation of sodium silicate. By firing coals which contained a mixture of two separately prepared coals, one with a sodium salt and the other with only silica, it was shown that at gas temperatures of 1200 °C- 1400 °C, sodium was completely released from the coal {{prior to the start of}} silicate formation. At 1000 °C, both organic sodium and sodium chloride were probably not fully released before silicate formation commenced. Exploratory experiments with kaolin evidenced that sodium, as sodium chloride, reacted to a greater extent with kaolin than with silica. Qualitative agreement was found between the experimental results and the thermodynamic equilibrium predictions of the influence of chlorine, sulphur, alumina and sodium concentration on the extent of sodium silicate or sodium aluminium silicate formation. Equilibrium calculations indicated that calcium or magnesium would reduce the extent of combination of sodium with silica. Theoretical predictions of the release rate of sodium from coal, during combustion, also agreed in general with experimental results. A theoretical model was developed to study the reaction of organic sodium with silica during coal combustion. From this model it was concluded that the reaction rate was controlled initially by the diffusion of sodium hydroxide in the char boundary layer but as combustion proceeded, the diffusion of sodium oxide in the product silicate melt combined with the diffusion of sodium hydroxide through the porous char increasing influenced the reaction rate. The results of the study show that the influence of sodium on the severity of fouling in boilers is dependent on the form and concentration of the sodium in the coal, the composition of the coal's other inorganic constituents and the combustion and furnace conditions...|$|E
40|$|This report {{details the}} results of a NIOSH {{investigation}} on the ability of the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) to accurately predict the explosibility of samples of coal and rock dust mixtures collected from underground coal mines in the U. S. The CDEM, which gives instantaneous results in real time, represents a new way for miners and operators to assess the relative hazard of dust accumulations in their mines and the effectiveness of their rock dusting practices. The CDEM was developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and successfully underwent national and international peer review. The intention of the device is to assist mine operators in complying with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) final rule 30 CFR* 75. 403, requiring that the incombustible content of combined coal dust, rock dust, and other dust be at least 80 % in underground areas of bituminous coal mines. As a final step towards commercialization of the CDEM, and to evaluate the performance of the device as a potential compliance tool, NIOSH undertook an extensive cooperative study with MSHA. This study, completed in 2009 - 2010, involved field use of the CDEM within MSHA's 10 bituminous coal districts. As part of their routine dust compliance surveys in these districts, MSHA inspectors collected sample coal and rock dust mixtures, field testing these samples for explosibility with the CDEM. Samples were then sent to the MSHA National Air and Dust Laboratory at Mt. Hope, WV, for parallel testing, first using a drying oven to determine the moisture followed by the traditional low temperature ashing (LTA) method. The LTA method determines explosibility of a coal and rock dust sample in a laboratory by heating the mixture to burn off the combustible material. The results, when combined with the moisture, are reported as total incombustible content (TIC). If the TIC is. 80 %, the sample is deemed to be nonexplosible and compliant with 30 CFR 75. 403. In the field component of this study, MSHA's use of the CDEM indicated that 30 % (175) of the 591 samples collected were explosible. NIOSH was able to obtain and remeasure 297 samples, and 97 % of those identified by the CDEM as being explosible (27 % of samples) or nonexplosible (73 % of samples) correlated with {{the results of}} the subsequent lab analysis using the LTA method. Of the remaining 3 % where there were differences between the field and laboratory methods, subsequent NIOSH evaluation attributed these differences to the variability (incomplete mixing, inadequate drying of the sample, the particle size of the rock dust and/or coal dust) of the samples being analyzed, the retained moisture in those samples, and the <b>inherent</b> <b>ash</b> in the coal. In considering these results and comparing the CDEM field measurements to the LTA laboratory measurements, {{it is important to understand}} the fundamental distinctions between the two methods. The determination of TIC by the LTA method is not itself a direct measure of explosibility, but a surrogate that calculates a single parameter associated with full-scale experimental results. This method is not based on particle size and treats all particles equally regardless of the size. In contrast, the CDEM utilizes a different approach, using optical reflectance to determine the ratio of rock dust to coal dust in a mixture, with full-scale experiments on flame propagation having already demonstrated the effects of varying the coal dust particle sizes and incombustible concentrations on the explosible vs. nonexplosible dust mixtures. A final important distinction between the two methods is that the CDEM offers real-time measurements of the explosion propagation hazard within a coal mine entry, allowing for immediate identification and mitigation of the problem, while the results from the traditional LTA method are not known for days or weeks after a sample is collected, allowing for the deficiency in rock dust to continue. The conclusions of this study strongly support the field use of the CDEM to measure the explosibility of coal and rock dust mixtures, to more effectively improve the onsite adequacy of rock dusting for explosion prevention. Mine operators could use the CDEM on a regular basis to ensure that their rock dusting practices are achieving inertization requirements and meeting the intent of 30 CFR 75. 403. MSHA inspectors could use the CDEM as a tool to immediately identify onsite explosibility hazards and initiate corrective action. A critical issue to both the LTA and the CDEM analysis methods is that the results are dependent on representative samples being collected for analysis.
