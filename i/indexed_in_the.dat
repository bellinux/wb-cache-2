500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is <b>indexed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first column by its {{number in the}} Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To print out the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting. [...] Collaborative works by Einstein are highlighted in lavender, with the co-author(s) provided in the final column of the table.|$|E

2500|$|The ranking is {{empirical}} and compiles {{a methodology}} that employs 10 different metrics. The criteria focused on academic papers, which indicate basic research performed at a university, and patent filings, which {{point to an}} institution's interest in protecting and commercializing its discoveries. Compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, the list uses proprietary data and analysis tools. The process began by identifying the 500 academic and government organizations that published {{the greatest number of}} articles in scholarly journals, as <b>indexed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database. The list was cross referenced against the number of patents filed by each organization during the same time period in the Derwent World Patents Index and the Derwent Innovations Index. Patent equivalents, citing patents and citing articles were included. The timeframe allows for the articles and patent activity to receive citations, thereby contributing to that portion of the methodology. The list was reduced to just those institutions that filed 70 or more patents, the bulk of which were universities. Each candidate university was then evaluated using various indicators including how often a university's patent applications were granted; how many patents were filed with global patent offices and local authorities; and how often the university's patents were cited by others. Universities were also evaluated in terms of how often their research papers were cited by patents; and the percentage of articles that featured a co-author from industry. The ranking has the Asia-Pacific edition featuring top 75 institutions across the region [...] and top 25 most innovative governmental institutions in the world.|$|E

50|$|When the {{conditions}} for dispersion staining are met (the particle is mounted in a liquid with a matching refractive <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible range of wavelengths but with a very different refractive index) then the particle has a high refractive <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red part of the spectrum and a lower refractive <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blue. This is because liquids {{tend to have a}} steeper dispersion curve than colorless solids. As a result, when the particle is dropped out of focus the red wavelengths are focused inward. For the blue wavelengths the particle behaves like a concave lens and the blue Becke` Line moves out into the liquid.|$|R
