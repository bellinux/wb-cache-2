In the process, he also considers all other factors that affect the witness’ credibility.

50|$|Davies {{had three}} {{children}} by his marriage. His only son to survive infancy John (Jack), was deaf and dumb but his daughter married Ferdinando Hastings and became Countess of Huntingdon. It is thought by many that his wife Eleanor {{may have been one}} of Davies's biggest problems in getting a job. On 28 July 1625 she was working on a commentary of the book of Daniel and believed she heard the voice of the prophet. Following this experience she wrote about it and took it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. When Davies found and burned her writing she predicted he would die within three years and went into mourning. In November 1626 Davies was appointed to high office in England. In early December, following Davies' new appointment, Eleanor started weeping during a dinner with friends. When asked why, she explained it was in anticipation of Davies' funeral. Davies was found in his home, dead of apoplexy on the morning of 8 December. In 1633, Eleanor was brought before the high commission in England on charges relating to her religious anagram practices. During a fruitless <b>examination</b> of her <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> one of the commissioners devised an anagram of his own: Dame Eleanor Davys - never so mad a ladye. She was sent to prison, and afterwards remarried, but was deserted by her new husband and buried next to Davies on her death in 1652.She continued to make prophesies until her death.|$|R
