50|$|Luftwaffe {{operational}} units returned to Chièvres {{during the summer}} of 1944 when a series of Junkers Ju 88 units, Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6); Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30), and Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) arrived in June and July. The units attacked targets in England, and later against Allied shipping in the English Channel after the Normandy Invasion of France. The base also served as a <b>diversion</b> <b>field</b> for Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
40|$|Although the SIP History-Info {{header field}} {{described}} in RFC 7044 {{is the solution}} adopted in IETF, the non-standard <b>Diversion</b> header <b>field</b> described, as Historic, in RFC 5806 is nevertheless already implemented and used for conveying call-diversion-related information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. RFC 7044 obsoletes the original RFC 4244 and redefines the History-Info header field for capturing the history information in requests. Since the <b>Diversion</b> header <b>field</b> is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the <b>Diversion</b> header <b>field</b> and the History-Info header field to handle call diversion information. This work is intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations toward IETF specification-based implementations. This document obsoletes RFC 6044, which describes the interworking between the <b>Diversion</b> header <b>field</b> defined in RFC 5806 and the obsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC 4244...|$|R
50|$|One {{branch of}} the Towerlands Tram Road {{appears to have been}} {{relatively}} cheaply constructed to supply coal to the population of Irvine and to the Town Mill using horse drawn waggons or trams that used dedicated sections of tram road {{along the edge of the}} existing road in places, with a few <b>diversions</b> through <b>fields</b> where necessary. The horse-drawn waggons may have been able to continue and complete their journey into Irvine by road, and as noted a weighing machine was present at Townhead near the toll.|$|R
40|$|A {{debris basin}} {{provides}} storage for silt, sand, gravel, or other debris moving from adjacent lands. The debris causes damage when it moves with runoff water from its source on land {{adjacent to a}} landowner's farm and deposits as sediment in ponds, waterways, <b>diversions,</b> bottomland <b>fields</b> or other developed areas. The landowner has no means of controlling {{the movement of the}} debris at its source on land adjacent to his or her farm and therefore must develop the debris basin on his or her own land to control the sediment before it causes damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of some water based EOR methods was evaluated for the Veslefrikk <b>field.</b> <b>Diversion</b> of injection water, by injection of sodium silicate, {{was regarded as}} having an EOR potential. This was analyzed by numerical simulation, first by using a conceptual model and then by using the full field simulation model. Different sensitivities were studied in the conceptual model. For a high vertical communication model the EOR was much lower than for a low vertical communication model. A possible sodium silicate pilot was studied in the full field simulation model. The simulation results indicated that considerable EOR volumes could be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} coupling {{between the}} ionosphere and magnetosphere is now {{understood to be}} Birkeland currents. During substorms the Birkeland current system in the midnight sector is generally interpreted as a cross-tail current interruption and <b>diversion</b> along magnetic <b>field</b> lines to the conducting ionosphere, which carries the intensified auroral electrojet. In the present study, the equatorial current diversion, the Birkeland current intensification, and the auroral electrojet increase in activity were observed to be initiated simultaneously {{at the onset of}} substorms. The principal finding is that the field-aligned currents of the components of the current wedge have been observed simultaneously on the ground, at low-altitude satellite orbits, and at geosynchronous satellite orbits. Recent dynamic modeling work by Chen et al. (1982) appears to support our findings. These observations contribute significantly toward the confirmation of the substorm current wedge model and complement and extend the results obtained by Nagai (1982) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{woundfin}} minnow (Plagopterus argentissimus) is {{a unique}} spiny-rayed minnow from the Colorado River system that was listed as Endangered in 1970 under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Prior to listing, the historical range was {{hundreds of miles of}} river that included the Gila, Colorado and Virgin Rivers in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. At the time of listing, woundfin were only found in approximately 80 miles of the Virgin River (Utah, Arizona, Nevada). Since listing, the woundfin has declined in the Virgin River due to non-native species (red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis), extended drought, and water development (Federal Register 2000). Woundfin currently exist primarily in a 17 mile reach of the upper Virgin River between the Quail Creek Diversion/ Pah Tempe Springs and the Washington <b>Fields</b> <b>Diversion</b> near St. George, Utah. Both diversions are large structures that typically divert most of the water from the Virgin River during the summer. At the top of the reach a thermal spring (Pah Tempe Springs) adds approximately 10 cfs of hot water to the reach. Groundwater, two small tributaries, a small hydropower plant discharge and a reservoir release (in the middle of the reach) add additional flow to the river. Woundfin numbers in the 17 mile reach have been critically low in recent drought years (especially 2001 - 2003). Woundfin Recovery Team fishes monitoring data since the late 1970 ’s indicate that woundfin numbers are lowest in the upper portion of this reach (Below the Ash Creek/La Verkin Creek confluence) and woundfin numbers fluctuate due to water year type. Woundfin numbers are low during low flow years and higher during high flow years (UDWR unpublished data). During the extreme drought year of 2002 (lowest water year on record), only 7 woundfin were captured in over 40 seining locations during fall collections. The most recent sampling (fall 2005), which followed an extremely wet year, showed that the number of woundfin captured for the same seining effort increased significantly to 1, 384 young-of-year (YOY) fish and 14 adults (UDWR unpublished data). The exact cause of the decline in the woundfin population during low flow years is still speculative, but some hypotheses suggest that the decline is related to high temperature and low turbidity during the low summer flow period and low dissolved oxygen during Quail Creek Diversion sluicing events (Fridell and Morvilius 2005 a). Here we focus on the effect high temperature [...] caused by low natural flows, natural hot springs, and water diversions [...] may be having on the woundfin population. We present the results of a laboratory growth and critical temperature study and river temperature data that indicate during the low flow years acute thermal tolerance and longer-term chronic temperatures for woundfin are periodically being exceeded...|$|R
