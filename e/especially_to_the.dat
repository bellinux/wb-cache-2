5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur.

5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon {{would have had}} to have been designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to the breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} and the series' legacy {{has focused on}} the two main trilogies of episodes, with Vorticons having large success as a shareware game and impacting the success of Apogee (now 3D Realms) and its shareware model. The second trilogy sold fewer copies, which was blamed by id and Apogee on its split into two parts, and the 2001 game received mixed reviews. The MS-DOS games have been re-released in several compilation packages, and all but the sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on platforms such as Steam. References to the series have been made by dozens of other games, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dopefish, an enemy in the fourth episode, which has been termed one of the video game industry's biggest in-jokes.

5|$|Initially, the IMD {{expected}} Chapala would intensify {{further into}} a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated it would strengthen to {{the equivalent of}} a Category5-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30October, causing the inner eyewall to degrade and for an outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. In addition, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around the eye to diminish. However, Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. On 31October, the outer eyewall became established, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the area's first hurricane-force impact since 1922.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active, costliest, and deadliest {{hurricane season}} since 2012. The season officially started on June1 and ended on November30, though the first storm, Hurricane Alex which formed in the Northeastern Atlantic, developed on January12, being the first hurricane to develop in January since 1938. The final storm, Otto, crossed into the Eastern Pacific on November25, {{a few days before}} the official end. Following Alex, Tropical Storm Bonnie brought flooding to South Carolina and portions of North Carolina. Tropical Storm Colin in early June brought minor flooding and wind damage to parts of the Southeastern United States, especially Florida. Hurricane Earl left 94fatalities in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, 81of which occurred in the latter. In early September, Hurricane Hermine, the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, brought extensive coastal flooding damage <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Forgotten and Nature coasts of Florida.

5|$|Natural {{resources}} {{have historically been}} the foundation of Spokane's economy, with the mining, logging, and agriculture industries providing much of the region's economic activity. After mining declined {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, agriculture and logging replaced mining as the primary influences in the economy. Lumberjacks and millmen working in the hundreds of mills along the railroads, rivers, and lakes of northern Washington and Idaho were provisioning themselves in Spokane. Agriculture has always been an important sector in the local economy. The surrounding area, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south is the Palouse, a region that has long been associated with farming, especially wheat production where it is one of the largest wheat producing regions in the United States. As with the mining industry in the late 1880s, Spokane was an important agricultural market and trade center. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Today, a large share of the wheat produced in the region is shipped to Far East markets. The Inland Northwest also supports many vineyards and microbreweries as well. By the early 20th century Spokane was primarily a commercial center rather than an industrial center.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise.
