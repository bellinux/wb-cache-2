The loops are created by recording the actual playing of the instrument and then slicing riffs with music editing software, and used by modern composers as an enhancement or {{as a basis for}} their own music. <b>Fish's</b> <b>loops</b> have been released with Sony Pictures Digital, Peace Love Productions, and Apple iLife.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{associations}} of form, practice, and textile history embodied in netted and looped head coverings preserved in burials on the desert coast of the south central Andes between 400 BC and AD 400. Following on my previous work on headdress elements in Paracas Necropolis, Cavernas and Ocucaje (Peters 2004) I have gone south to look at wrapped and fitted headdress elements in the valleys that run directly from the high herded plains south of Lake Titicaca to the Pacific Ocean. This work is inspired, in part, by a paper given for the TSA by Nikki Clark and Amy Oakland Rodman (1994) and by Anne Paul’s work on Paracas turbans (1982 / 3). On the Paracas peninsula and in contemporary cemeteries of the nearby Pisco and Ica valleys, hammock shaped and hood shaped netted and looped headdress elements are wrapped around braided or bound hair, under the knotted or looped or diagonal interlaced headbands. In embroidered and painted images associated with the tombs, depiction of net-like structures is associated with images of headdresses, slings, and bags holding human heads or <b>fish.</b> <b>Looped</b> caps of dark brown camelid hair or human hair appear in several Paracas Necropolis EIP 1 burials and EIP 2 images. Examples from burial 89 ar...|$|R

50|$|The {{property}} is open year round, sunrise to sunset, for hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and hunting (in season). Hunting is only permitted {{on the part}} of the property which lies west of the Outer <b>Loop.</b> <b>Fishing</b> is strictly prohibited. Dogs are allowed, but must be kept under voice control or on a leash. Mountain Bikes and Horseback Riders are permitted on the fire road only. The reservation offers more than 3 miles of trails and throughout the property and has moderate hiking which can be strenuous in places.|$|R
40|$|Meiotic {{chromosomes}} {{in human}} oocytes are packaged differently than in spermatocytes at the pachytene stage of meiosis I, when crossing-over takes place. Thus the meiosis-specific pairing structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), is considerably longer in oocytes {{in comparison to}} spermatocytes. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the influence of this length factor on meiotic recombination in male and female human germ cells. The positions of crossovers were identified by the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH 1. Spermatocytes have approximately 50 crossovers per cell in comparison to more than 70 in oocytes. Analyses of inter-crossover distances (and presumptively crossover interference) along SCs suggested that while there might be inter-individual variation, there was no consistent difference between sexes. Thus the higher rate of recombination in human oocytes is not a consequence of more closely spaced crossovers along the SCs. The rate of recombination per unit length of SC is higher in spermatocytes than oocytes. However, when the so-called obligate chiasma is excluded from the analysis, then the rates of recombination per unit length of SC are essentially identical in the two sexes. Our analyses indicate that the inter-sex difference in recombination is largely a consequence of the difference in meiotic chromosome architecture in the two sexes. We propose that SC length per se, and therefore the size of the physical platform for crossing-over (and not the DNA content) is the principal factor determining the difference in rate of recombination in male and female germ cells. A preliminary investigation of SC loop size by fluorescence in situ hybridization (<b>FISH)</b> indicated <b>loops</b> may be shorter in oocytes than in spermatocytes. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

50|$|Questa has {{two local}} parks: the Municipal Park and the Moly Park. The Municipal Park is {{relatively}} new and {{is a product of}} the hard work done by local students. Right by the Questa Library the park and playground it is open to all age ranges. The Moly Park contains public athletic fields.Outside and extremely near Questa is the surrounding Rio Gande del Norte National Monument and Carson National Forest. Within the National Forest is Eagle Rock Lake right next to Village limits featuring a walking <b>loop,</b> <b>fishing,</b> and picnicking. The Cabresto Lake features hiking trails, swimming, fishing, canoeing, picnicking, and camping. The trails from Cabresto Lake lead to mountain top lakes in the Latir Peaks Wilderness. In the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument hiking trails, fishing, picnicking, and camping are found. On the Monument two popular locations: the La Junta Overlook where the Rio Grande and the Red River come together over 800 feet below and the Big Arsenic Trail containing Petroglyphs and a natural spring.|$|R
40|$|Growth hormone (GH) {{is known}} to {{play a key role}} in the {{regulation}} of body growth and metabolism. Similar to mammals, GH secretion in fish is under the control of hypothalamic factors. Besides, signals generated within the pituitary and/or from peripheral tissues/organs can also exert a feedback control on GH release by effects acting on both the hypothalamus and/or anterior pituitary. Among these feedback signals, the functional role of IGF is well conserved from fish to mammals. In contrast, the effects of steroids and thyroid hormones are more variable and appear to be species-specific. Recently, a novel intrapituitary feedback loop regulating GH release and GH gene expression has been identified in <b>fish.</b> This feedback <b>loop</b> has three functional components: (i) LH induction of GH release from somatotrophs, (ii) amplification of GH secretion by GH autoregulation in somatotrophs, and (iii) GH feedback inhibition of LH release from neighboring gonadotrophs. In this article, the mechanisms for feedback control of GH synthesis and secretion are reviewed and functional implications of this local feedback loop are discussed. This intrapituitary feedback loop may represent a new facet of pituitary research with potential applications in aquaculture and clinical studies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Aquaponics {{might be}} one {{solution}} to produce food in a more sustainable way in the future. Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponics {{in a way that}} the disadvantages of one system become the advantages of the other one. The nutrient rich excess water from the fish tank is used for plant growth, while the plants are used as biofilter to clean the water for the <b>fish.</b> Further closed <b>loops</b> can be created by using plant-residues, sludge and food wastes as raw materials for a biogas digester. With a combined heat and power plant (CHP) the produced methane can be used for heat and electricity production needed by the aquaponics. This report determines if such implementation can lead to reduced overall running costs and which size the aquaponics should have. As example location Sweden is chosen. It shows that the methane demand of a CHP requires a minimum size of the biogas digesters and aquaponics. In the aquaponics at least 50 t of fish have to be bread with a complementing grow bed area of 800 - 900 m 2. In total the aquaponics system contains 1000 m 3 water. The Energy produced by the CHP will not cover totally the energy demand of the aquaponics-system and should be complement by energy from other sources (e. g. solar cells, wind turbines) if there is no access to a stable external energy supply. Energy produced by the CHP has an average price between 1 - 2. 1 kr/kWh. If no CHP is implemented, there is no minimum size required for the aquaponics- and biogas-system and the produced methane can be used for heating and cooking...|$|R
