40|$|The role of {{emotions}} in {{learning and teaching}} has largely been neglected in educational literature, particularly in higher education. Yet {{there are signs of}} increased interest in emotions in recent literature. This paper argues that emotions are a vital aspect of relationships. How we feel with and about others is central to the quality of those relationships. Thus, emotions matter in college teaching and learning as an aspect of enriching social and relational experiences that support student development. This paper discusses four <b>key</b> <b>relationships</b> in higher education: students with subject matter; students with teachers; students with other students; and students with their developing selves. For each <b>key</b> <b>relationship,</b> <b>key</b> literature is referenced, and suggestions for enhancing practice are offered...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{alternative}} theoretical {{explanations of}} empirical evidence of increasing regional income inequality in the United States since the mid- 1970 s. Analysis indicates that conventional regional growth theories, including the neoclassical, export base, cumulative causation, and growth pole theories, explain increasing regional inequality by resorting to exogenous forces. Although {{each of the}} theories contains <b>key</b> <b>relationships</b> that provide a partial explanation of unbalanced growth and regional inequality, none of them is complete. The theory of long waves, long {{used in the study}} of economic cycles, then is examined. <b>Key</b> <b>relationships</b> contained in each of the regional growth theories are synthesized with the long wave explanation to generate a more complete theory of unbalanced regional growth and an endogenous explanation of increasing regional inequality...|$|R

40|$|A loss {{estimation}} methodology {{is presented}} which provides several measures of seismic performance to decision-makers. The is methodology based on parametrically describing several <b>key</b> <b>relationships</b> between: (i) ground motion intensity measure (IM) and exceedance rate ?(IM); (ii) IM and engineering demand parameter (EDP); (iii) EDP and damage states (DS); and (iv) DS and economic loss (L). Both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are considered {{in each of}} the <b>key</b> <b>relationships.</b> A vector of EDPs is used and correlations between components are considered. The expected loss and standard deviation of loss {{as a function of the}} ground motion IM are obtained, allowing various percentile loss hazard curves to be computed. The distribution of Expected Annual Loss (EAL) is obtained for use in budgeting or assessing retrofit solutions.

40|$|School design occurs {{within a}} {{complicated}} matrix of divergent {{aspirations of the}} stakeholder community, changing ideas on education pedagogy and uncertainty on the most effective environments to facilitate learning. There are many contributors in the school design processes, each with their own objectives, creating a challenging climate for the architects to design within. Through research, exemplar case study analysis and reflection on school architecture projects that I have completed over the last ten years, I have identified three <b>key</b> <b>relationships</b> in the school design processes between the School Community, Architect and Pedagogy. The roles, interactions and participation of these three parties can impact the architectural outcomes. A series of deficiencies and reoccurring issues were identified by this study, which potentially inhibit {{the development of the}} three <b>key</b> <b>relationships.</b> To assist the architect in navigating these issues, my PhD research has focused on the development of School Design Tools, which provide strategies and approaches that can be used at different stages of design to assist in bridging the areas of deficiency. The tools identify key aspirations and objectives at each design stage, and evolved with the development of the project. They aim to capture and build on the three <b>key</b> <b>relationships</b> through facilitating and structuring the briefing process with the school and creating a balance between the School Community, Architect and Education Pedagogy, so as to support the design of more effective school architecture.
