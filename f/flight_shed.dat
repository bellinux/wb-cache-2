40|$|Ideal <b>flight</b> <b>sheds</b> {{the least}} amount of kinetic energy into a wake while imparting {{momentum}} sufficient to balance the vehicle weight. This combination defines a unique downwash distribution for the wake, which an aircraft designer should provide for. A central fuselage, as required for the typical flicht objective, presents an obstacle to this intent. A wing interrupted by a prominent fuselage is expected to shed inboard trailing vortices with central upwash harmful to the span efficiency of the aircraft. It is proposed here that a trailing edge on the fuselage can be used to control the circulation in the central region of the aircraft so that the central downwash deficiency can be avoided. Such a Kutta edge can further be applied as part of a high-o 8 ft system to increase cehtrao d 9 ownwashy by ihncreasi 8 ng the loading on the wing root and lift over the fuselage itself. Time-averaged flowfields behind a wing-body combination with and without a Kutta edge have been measured in wind-tunnel experiments. The results show that an edged aft-body does influence central circulation, as predicted. Flight with ideal wakes may be more readily attained than hitherto realized. [URL]...|$|R

I studied remigial moult in two sea ducks, Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and White-winged Scoters (M. fusca), in southeast Alaska and the Salish Sea to evaluate evidence of temporal, energetic or nutritional constraints. Scoters exhibited a relatively long flightless period and high inter-individual variation in timing of moult, suggesting there were not strong temporal constraints during this phase of the annual cycle. Increasing body mass during the feather growth period indicated that scoters met costs of moult without relying on endogenous reserves and they did so at moderate levels of foraging effort, strong evidence of lack of energetic or nutritional constraints...|$|R

40|$|Molt {{patterns}} of wild whooping cranes (Grus americana) are largely unknown, and what knowledge we have {{has been based}} on scant data. We documented {{patterns of}} feather molt in nonmigratory whooping cranes in Florida during 1993 - 2005. All birds replaced flight feathers (remiges) in a synchronous (simultaneous) manner and spent time flightless. It took 38 - 46 days (mean = 44 days, n = 8) for feathers to regrow and birds to regain flight ability. When flightless due to remigial molt, cranes became more secretive and spent more time in wetlands during feather regrowth. Most (70 %) whooping cranes first molted their remiges at 3 years of age, 20 % at 2 years of age, and 10 % at 4 years of age. Birds never molted their flight feathers in consecutive years; instead they usually skipped 1 or 2 years between molts. Sets of flight feathers lasted 2 - 4 years (mean 2. 5 years, n = 41). The remigial molt was seasonal; <b>flight</b> feathers were <b>shed</b> during 10 April- 23 June, and contour plumage was molted later in the year (24 June- 23 October).

50|$|The act of {{manufacturing}} the Brabazon alone {{was found to}} be a challenge. During {{the first two years of}} the development, the question of how and where to manufacture the aircraft was amongst the biggest issues that had preoccupied the design team and delayed progress on the project. Bristol's existing factory at Bristol Filton Airport proved to be too small to handle what was one of the largest aircraft in the world, let alone producing the type in quantity, while the adjacent 2,000 ft (610 m) runway was also too short to launch it. While considerations were made for developing the firm's Banwell facility, it was eventually decided to expand the main Filton site to suit the Brabazon. Work on the project was slowed as a consequence of meeting Bristol's wartime commitments; amongst the early physical steps was the construction of a full-scale wooden mockup in the old No. 2 <b>Flight</b> <b>Shed</b> so that components and fittings could be applied and tested.|$|E

During the war the site was also home to some of Hawker Hurricanes and Airspeed Oxfords that were under the command of No. 9 Group RAF. By the end of the war, over 3,000 bombers had been built and flown from Samlesbury.|$|E
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} to suggest that space flight leads to immune system dysregulation, however the nature of the phenomenon as it equilibrates over longer flights has not been determined. This dysregulation may be a result of microgravity, confinement, physiological stress, radiation, environment or other mission-associated factors. The clinical risk (if any) for exploration-class space flight is unknown, but may include increased incidence of infection, allergy, hypersensitivity, hematological malignancy or altered wound healing. The objective of this Supplemental Medical Objective (SMO) is to determine the status of the immune system, physiological stress and latent viral reactivation (a clinical outcome that can be measured) during both short and long-duration spaceflight. In addition, this study will develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints. Pre-mission, in-flight and post-flight blood and saliva samples will be obtained from participating crewmembers. Assays included peripheral immunophenotype, T cell function, cytokine profiles (RNA, intracellular, secreted), viral-specific immunity, latent viral reactivation (EBV, CMV, VZV), and stress hormone measurements. This study is currently ongoing. To date, 10 short duration and 5 long-duration crewmembers have completed the study. Technically, the study is progressing well. In-flight blood samples are being collected, and returned for analysis, including functional assays that require live cells. For all in-flight samples to date, sample viability has been acceptable. Preliminary data (n = 4 / 7; long/short duration, respectively) indicate that distribution of most peripheral leukocyte subsets is largely unaltered during flight. Exceptions include elevated T cells, reduced B/NK cells, increased memory T cells and increased central memory CD 8 + T cells. General T cell function, early blastogenesis response to mitogenic stimulation, is markedly reduced in-flight. In-vivo cytokine production profiles are altered, with in-flight dysregulation observed in the Th 1 /Th 2 /Treg equilibrium. EBV specific T cell levels are increased during flight, whereas their function is reduced. VZV reactivation was observed inflight and several days post flight with highest levels measured later during long-duration <b>flight.</b> The <b>shedding</b> of CMV in the urine was detected of 4 / 5 long duration and 4 / 7 short duration crewmembers. Plasma cortisol was not elevated during flight. Further data will be required to validate the initial observations...|$|R

40|$|In the {{classical}} concept {{for the operation}} of electrodynamic tethers in space, a voltage is generated across the tether, either by the tether's orbital motion through the earth's planetary magnetic field or by a power supply; electrons are then collected from the ionospheric plasma at the positive pole; actively emitted back into space at the negative pole; and the circuit is closed by currents driven through the ambient conducting ionosphere. This concept has been proven to work in space by the Tethered Satellite System TSS- 1 and TSS- 1 R Space Shuttle missions; and the Plasma Motor-Generator (PMG) tether flight experiment. However, it limits electrodynamic tether operations to the F-region of the ionosphere where the plasma density is sufficient to conduct the required currents [...] in other words, between altitudes of approximately 200 to 1000 km in sunlight. In the earth's shadow, the ionospheric density drops precipitously and tether operations, using the above approach, are not effective [...] even within this altitude range. There are numerous missions that require in-space propulsion in the Earth's shadow and/or outside of the above altitude range. This paper will, therefore, present the fundamentals of a concept that would allow electrodynamic tethers to operate almost anywhere within the magnetosphere, the region of space containing the earth's planetary magnetic field. In other words, because operations would be virtually independent of any ambient plasma, the range of electrodynamic operations would be extended into the earth's shadow and out to synchronous orbit [...] forty times the present operational range. The key to this concept is the active generation of plasma at each pole of the tether so that current generation,does {{not depend on the}} conductivity of the ambient ionosphere. Arguments will be presented, based on,existing <b>flight</b> data, which <b>shed</b> light on the behavior of charge emissions in space and show the plausibility of the concept...|$|R
