5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. <b>Experimental</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. <b>Experimental</b> <b>studies</b> have shown that mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E

5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of an <b>experimental</b> <b>study,</b> we propose a {{cognitive}} simulation model of collaborative problem solving and learning. In the <b>experimental</b> <b>study,</b> we investigated how qualitative and quantitative problem representations in classical mechanics are acquired and successively interrelated during collaborative problem solving. Two students, who were taught different aspects of classical mechanics, collaborated on problems which were beyond the competence of each of them individually. Students successfully learned to interrelate qualitative and quantitative problem representations. Furthermore, students who initially were taught qualitative aspects of classical mechanics gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners than the other way round. The model simulates collaborative problem solving and learning under the conditions set up in the <b>experimental</b> <b>study.</b> On {{the basis of}} the model it was possible to reconstruct the main results of the <b>experimental</b> <b>study...</b>|$|R
