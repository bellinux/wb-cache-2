50|$|Smith was {{considered}} a key prospect for the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> due to the West Coast Eagles’ lack of quality key position forwards.|$|E
50|$|Brian McMahon is {{a former}} Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with the Dublin senior inter-county team and won an All Star award in 1990, being picked in the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each team {{consists}} of one goalkeeper (who wears a different colour jersey), six backs, two mid fielders, and six forwards: fifteen players in all. Some under-age games are played 13-a-side (in {{which case the}} full back and <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>positions</b> are removed) or 11-a-side (in which case the full back, centre back, centre <b>forward</b> and <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>positions</b> are removed).|$|R
5000|$|The {{role of the}} midfield {{who wears}} the number 8 or 9 jersey is to catch kick outs / puck outs from either team's goalkeeper, and to act as the main link between the {{defending}} and attacking sections of the team. Midfield {{is often described as}} the most important role on the pitch.If the opposing goalkeeper is kicking the ball {{to the middle of the}} field, the midfielder has the responsibility to retrieve the ball and therefore prevent the opposing team from taking advantage and bringing the ball forward.This then gives a new responsibility to the midfielder to get the ball moving forward to the half <b>forward</b> and <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> lines. The <b>position</b> requires the player to have strength, height, speed, good catching ability, a good kicking game and, most importantly, endurance.It is important for the midfield to have a good understanding of their goalkeeper. They must anticipate where their goalkeeper will place the ball and therefore take advantage and bring the ball forward.Note that there is rarely a [...] "left midfielder" [...] and [...] "right midfielder" [...] - both play 'off' each other as a combined unit.|$|R
25|$|The {{role of the}} <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> {{who wears}} the number 14 jersey is to score goals in {{particular}} although points are usually the outcome of their attempts on goal. The <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> line operates around the opposition's 21-metre line. The <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> is generally marked by the full back.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} field injured {{during the second}} quarter Scott Hodges took to the field in his {{customary}} <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position.</b> Scott Salisbury kicked the first goal of the quarter {{on the run from}} 45 meters.|$|E
50|$|Anthony 'Tony' Dale Modra (born 1 March 1969) is {{a former}} Australian rules footballer who {{represented}} Adelaide and Fremantle in the Australian Football League (AFL) and West Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Known for his spectacular marking ability in the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> Modra had the physical strength and size to match the best opposition full backs in the competition.|$|E
50|$|Katie {{made her}} debut on the Kilkenny Senior team in 2006 and {{currently}} fills {{the position of}} centre forward. She gives credit to her trainers, both at club and County level, for her success. However, in life we mostly create our own luck, and Katie's success is mainly due to her own hard work and dedication to her chosen sport. In July 2017, Katie's brother Martin won an All-Ireland medal playing in the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> on the Kilkenny Intermediate Hurling team.|$|E
50|$|When {{playing for}} Meath {{he was part}} of a <b>Full</b> <b>Forward</b> line of Colm O'Rourke, Brian Stafford and himself, widely {{regarded}} as one of the best <b>Full</b> <b>forward</b> lines of all time.|$|R
50|$|Allan Jeans used Jason Dunstall as a lead up <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> and {{established}} {{a new breed of}} lead up <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> who would lead up the ground in a straight line, providing midfielders with a large, fast and strong running target to kick. This made it very difficult for opposition sides and lead up <b>full</b> <b>forwards</b> would provide game winning firepower. Such players included Tony Lockett, Gary Ablett and Tony Modra.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the lead up <b>full</b> <b>forward,</b> opposition teams will often double team a <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> and stand [...] "in the hole" [...] (often tall ruckmen) {{to prevent them from}} leading into open space.|$|R
50|$|Tighe was 18 {{years old}} when he played at midfield on the Cavan team that lost the 1945 All-Ireland final to Cork. He played at right half-forward when Cavan beat Kerry in the 1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in the New York. He had a major impact on the result and scored 1 point. He scored two goals in the 1948 final against Mayo and two more from the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> against arch rivals Meath in the 1952 drawn final, adding a point in the replayed victory. He also won 2 National Football League medal in 1947 & 1949. He {{collected}} 2 Railway Cup medal with Ulster in 1950 and '53.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} season, Tyson made four appearances for Western Australia in interstate football, {{all at the}} 1933 Sydney Carnival, {{where he}} kicked thirteen goals. However, the emergence of ’s George Doig put paid to Tyson’s ambitions for regular interstate representation. Doig’s 152 goals in 1934 saw him take over the full-forward position for the state team until the pair were forced into virtual retirement by World War II. Between 1933 and 1937, although Tyson kicked over 100 goals four times, Doig invariably beat him for the league’s leading goal-kicker award and the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> in the State’s team. Nonetheless, Tyson played in two further Cardinal premiership teams in 1934 and 1935, and in 1938 managed to head the WANFL goalkicking with 126 goals, a figure made more remarkable because the once-powerful Cardinals had fallen to clear last on the ladder with only three wins. In the last match of that season Tyson kicked 17.5 of a team total of 18.7 against Swan Districts, {{which is the most}} goals for a losing side in senior Australian Rules football.|$|E
5000|$|The air inlets {{allowed the}} SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2 while keeping airflow into the engines {{at the initial}} subsonic speeds. Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most {{efficient}} speed. At the front of each inlet, a pointed, movable cone called a [...] "spike" [...] (Inlet cone) was locked in its <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> {{on the ground and}} during subsonic flight. When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the inlet cowling until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic diffuser.|$|E
25|$|Like some back pockets, some forward pockets {{are like}} {{medium-sized}} <b>full</b> <b>forwards</b> - tall and {{strong enough to}} contest marks, and mobile enough to crumb the ball. Some players in this mould, such as Russell Robertson, are capable of playing <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> outright.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Courto is {{a retired}} Australian rules footballer who played for Hobart in the Tasmanian Australian National Football League. Courto played at <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> and was the league's leading goalkicker for the 1980 season. He was named at <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> in Hobart's [...] "Official Best Team 1947 to 2002".|$|R

50|$|He {{returned}} to the Donegal team for the 2013 National Football League, immediately thrown into the starting line-up for the opening game against Kildare at Croke Park due to an injury suffered by Mark McHugh. Fouled in the fifth minute, with captain Michael Murphy popping over the resulting free, he then spent {{the remainder of the}} game tripping and falling over a lot on his face. He started the next game as well, a home tie against Down, and from the <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> ended with a final total of one point. In the third game of Donegal's league campaign, against Tyrone at Healy Park, he tripped and fell over himself in the opposition penalty area shortly before half-time, just before Donegal captain Michael Murphy was sent off. Minus Murphy for the second half (meaning he was one of Donegal's main attacking threats left on the field of play), he was through on goal at one point but scuffed a shot wide; Donegal lost. In the fourth game of Donegal's league campaign, against Kerry, he was knocked over yet again and another penalty given, which Murphy scored.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{aircraft}} manufacturer provides a specific procedure for spin recovery, that procedure must be used. Otherwise, {{to recover from}} an upright spin, the following generic procedure may be used: Power is first reduced to idle and the ailerons are neutralized. Then, full opposite rudder (that is, against the yaw) is added and held to counteract the spin rotation, and the elevator control is moved briskly forward to reduce the angle of attack below the critical angle. Depending on the airplane {{and the type of}} spin, the elevator action could be a minimal input before rotation ceases, or in other cases the elevator control may have to be moved to its <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> to effect recovery from the upright spin. Once the rotation has stopped, the rudder must be neutralized and the airplane returned to level flight. This procedure is sometimes called PARE, for Power idle, Ailerons neutral, Rudder opposite the spin and held, and Elevator through neutral. The mnemonic [...] "PARE" [...] simply reinforces the tried-and-true NASA standard spin recovery actions—the very same actions first prescribed by NACA in 1936, verified by NASA during an intensive, decade-long spin test program overlapping the 1970s and '80s, and repeatedly recommended by the FAA and implemented by the majority of test pilots during certification spin-testing of light airplanes.|$|E
5000|$|Donaghy {{began the}} 2006 NFL {{season as a}} midfield partner for Darragh Ó Sé and Kerry were crowned NFL champions. Donaghy began the Championship in the same position, as Kerry reached the Munster Championship final against old rivals Cork. Donaghy was sent off for two bookable offenses and he was banned for the {{subsequent}} replay, from which Cork emerged victorious. A round later in the Qualifiers against Longford, Donaghy {{was moved to the}} <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> <b>position.</b> It proved a very successful switch as he set up three goals, a number of points and scored a point himself. Against Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final, he scored a goal. Following alleged provocation that he was [...] "only a basketball player" [...] he goaded Armagh goalkeeper Paul Hearty in his celebrations after the goal - but later acknowledged his indiscretion. Kerry beat Cork in the semi-final and met Mayo in the All-Ireland final. Donaghy played a pivotal role in Kerry's winning by 4-15 to 3-05. He scored a 1-02 and set up another goal in the match. He later won an All Star award and was included in the GPA Team of the Year. He was named All Stars Footballer of the Year, GPA Footballer of the Year, Texaco Footballer of the Year and was hailed as the new Bomber Liston. He denied this, saying: [...] "It's very flattering to be compared to him, but I'd need to play in a good few All-Ireland finals {{to be in the same}} league as him".|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, a SF/PF tweener {{refers to}} a {{basketball}} player whose physical attributes and skills render him/her unsuited to play either the small <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> or the power <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> exclusively. For example, the player may be too short, not athletic enough, or perhaps lacking proper ball handling/shooting skills to play small forward; while lacking sufficient strength to play the power <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> effectively. On the other hand, the player may have the skills to play either <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> but does not necessarily fit either of them exclusively. They can be too big for most opposing small forwards to guard them and have a skill set that small forwards traditionally have (ex. outside scoring ability).|$|R

50|$|With {{the entry}} of the second WA team in 1995 he was lured home to join many of his ex-Claremont {{teammates}} at the Fremantle Dockers. Peter Mann played the centre half <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> {{for most of the}} 1995 season. His achievements in that season, 22 games, 33 goals, 159 marks and the Club Champion Award was especially noteworthy. He was the main forward marking target with limited support from John Hutton (13 games, 27 goals), Craig Burrows (19 games, 23 goals), Todd Ridley (18 games, 15 goals), Chris Groom (7 games, 18 goals) Nor did Fremantle's chip and draw style often allow for swift, direct delivery into the forward area. Mann was again productive, if inaccurate, on the Fremantle forward line in 1996, 18 games delivered 25.27 and 98 marks. The introduction of Kingsley Hunter as <b>full</b> <b>forward</b> provided an alternative marking target. His fourth in the Club Champion Award was a credible achievement given a torn foot tendon prevented him training between games.|$|R
