40|$|The current {{approach}} of morbidity control of schistosomiasis, a helminth disease of poverty with considerable {{public health and}} socioeconomic impact, is based on preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel. There is a pressing need for new drugs against this disease whose control entirely depends on this single drug that has been widely used over the past 40  years. We argue that a broader anthelminthic approach supplementing praziquantel with new antischistosomals targeting different parasite development stages would not only increase efficacy but also reduce the risk for <b>drug</b> resistance. <b>Repositioning</b> <b>drugs</b> already approved for other diseases provides a shortcut to clinical trials, as {{it is expected that}} such drugs rapidly pass the regulatory authorities. The antischistosomal properties of antimalarial drugs (e. g., semisynthetic artemisinins, synthetic trioxolanes, trioxaquines and mefloquine) and of drugs being developed or registered for other purposes (e. g., moxidectin and miltefosin), administered alone or in combination with praziquantel, have been tested in the laboratory and clinical trials. Another avenue to follow is the continued search for new antischistosomal properties in plants.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of novel drug targets {{is a significant}} challenge in drug development. Although the human genome comprises approximately 30, 000 genes, proteins encoded by fewer than 400 are used as drug targets {{in the treatment of}} diseases. Therefore, novel drug targets are extremely valuable as the source for first in class drugs. On the other hand, many of the currently known drug targets are functionally pleiotropic and involved in multiple pathologies. Several of them are exploited for treating multiple diseases, which highlights the need for methods to reliably <b>reposition</b> <b>drug</b> targets to new indications. Network-based methods have been successfully applied to prioritize novel disease-associated genes. In recent years, several such algorithms have been developed, some focusing on local network properties only, and others taking the complete network topology into account. Common to all approaches is the understanding that novel disease-associated candidates are in close overall proximity to known disease genes. However, the relevance of these methods to the prediction of novel drug targets has not yet been assessed. Here, we present a network-based approach for the prediction of drug targets for a given disease. The method allows both <b>repositioning</b> <b>drug</b> targets known for other diseases to the given disease and the prediction of unexploited drug targets which are not used for treatment of any disease. Our approach takes as input a disease gene expression signature and a high-quality interaction network and outputs a prioritized list of drug targets. We demonstrate the high performance of our method and highlight the usefulness of the predictions in three case studies. We present novel drug targets for scleroderma and different types of cancer with their underlying biological processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our method to identify non-suspected repositioning candidates using diabetes type 1 as an example...|$|R

Here, we present a formal consensus evaluation of these opportunities, based on a systematic review of published literature. We highlight several compounds for which sufficient evidence is available to encourage further investigation to clarify an optimal dose and consider progression to clinical trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} <b>drug</b> <b>repositioning</b> over traditional drug development {{is that since}} the repositioned drug has already passed {{a significant number of}} toxicity and other tests, its safety is known and the risk of failure for reasons of adverse toxicology are reduced. More than 90% of drugs fail during development, and this is the most significant reason for the high costs of pharmaceutical R&D. In addition, repurposed drugs can bypass much of the early cost and time needed to bring a drug to market. It significantly reduces the transition of bench research work to treatment at bedside. On the other hand, <b>drug</b> <b>repositioning</b> faces some challenges itself since the intellectual property issues surrounding the original drug may be complex and from a commercial point of view it may not always make sense to take such a drug to market.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sixteen FDA-approved {{drugs were}} {{investigated}} to elucidate their mechanisms of action (MOAs) and clinical functions by pathway analysis based on retrieved drug targets interacting with or {{affected by the}} investigated drugs. Protein and gene targets and associated pathways were obtained by data-mining of public databases including the MMDB, PubChem BioAssay, GEO DataSets, and the BioSystems databases. Entrez E-Utilities were applied, and in-house Ruby scripts were developed for data retrieval and pathway analysis to identify and evaluate relevant pathways common to the retrieved drug targets. Pathways pertinent to clinical uses or MOAs were obtained for most drugs. Interestingly, some drugs identified pathways responsible for other diseases than their current therapeutic uses, and these pathways were verified retrospectively by in vitro tests, in vivo tests, or clinical trials. The pathway enrichment analysis based on drug target information from public databases could provide a novel approach for elucidating <b>drug</b> MOAs and <b>repositioning,</b> therefore benefiting the discovery of new therapeutic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background <b>Drug</b> {{repurposing}} or <b>repositioning</b> {{refers to}} the usage of existing drugs in diseases other than those it was originally used for. For diseases like malaria, where there is an urgent need for active drug candidates, the strategy offers a route to significantly shorten the traditional drug development pipelines. Preliminary high-throughput screens on patent expired drug libraries have recently been carried out for Plasmodium falciparum. This study reports the systematic and objective further interrogation of selected compounds reported in these studies, to enable their repositioning as novel stand-alone anti-malarials or as combinatorial partners. Methods SYBR Green flow cytometry and micro-titre plate assays optimized in the laboratory were used to monitor drug susceptibility of in vitro cultures of P. falciparum K 1 parasite strains.

40|$|AbstractUnintended {{effects of}} drugs {{can be caused}} by various mechanisms. Conventional {{analysis}} of unintended effects has focused on the target proteins of drugs. However, an interaction with off-target tissues of a drug might be one of the unintended effect-related mechanisms. We propose two processes to predict a drug's unintended effects by off-target tissue effects: 1) identification of a drug's off-target tissue and; 2) tissue protein – symptom relation identification (tissue protein – symptom matrix). Using this method, we predicted that 1, 177 (10. 7 %) side-effects were related to off-target tissue effects in 11, 041 known side-effects. Off-target tissues and unintended effects of successful <b>repositioning</b> <b>drugs</b> were also predicted. The effectiveness of relations of the proposed tissue protein – symptom matrix were evaluated by using the literature mining method. We predicted unintended effects of drugs as well as those effect-related off-target tissues.

40|$|In {{patients}} with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) {{is a major}} concern in the management of these devastating diseases. Among NPS in AD, agitation and aggression are common with earlier institutionalization, increased morbidity and mortality, and greater caregiver burden. Pharmacological treatments for AD-related agitation, specifically off-label use of atypical antipsychotics, showed only modest improvements, with increased side-effect burden and risk of mortality. Non-pharmacological treatment approaches have become the preferred firstline option. However, when such treatments fail, pharmacological options are often used. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify effective and safe pharmacological treatments for agitation/aggression in AD and dementia. Unfortunately, progresses have been slow, with a small number of methodologically heterogeneous randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with disappointing results. However, evidence coming from recently completed RCTs on novel or <b>repositioned</b> <b>drugs</b> (mibampator, dextromethorphan/ quinidine, cannabinoids, and citalopram) showed some promise in treating agitation in AD, but still with safety concerns.

40|$|Predicting drug-target {{interactions}} {{is important}} for the development of novel <b>drugs</b> and the <b>repositioning</b> of <b>drugs.</b> To predict such interactions, {{there are a number of}} methods based on drug and target protein similarity. Although these methods, such as the bipartite local model (BLM), show promise, they often categorize unknown interactions as negative interaction. Therefore, these methods are not ideal for finding potential drug-target interactions that have not yet been validated as positive interactions. Thus, here we propose a method that integrates machine learning techniques, such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM, to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a clustering method. Then, using the BLM method and self-training SVM, the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and nuclear receptors, SELF-BLM showed the best performance for predicting not only known interactions but also potential interactions in three protein classes compare to other related studies.

40|$|<b>Drug</b> {{repurposing}} or <b>repositioning</b> is {{an important}} part of drug discovery that has been growing in the last few years for the development of therapeutic options in oncology. We applied this paradigm in a screening of a library of about 3, 800 compounds (including FDA-approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds) employing a model of metastatic pheochromocytoma, the most common tumor of the adrenal medulla in children and adults. The collection of approved drugs was screened in quantitative mode, testing the compounds in compound-titration series (dose-response curves). Analysis of the dose-response screening data facilitated the selection of 50 molecules with potential bioactivity in pheochromocytoma cells.
