5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> losses of A$130million.|$|E

5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> for Silver Linings Playbook, then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E

For IMAX in its second weekend, Captain America: Civil War earned $31 million, a new record for a day-and-date opening for a Marvel film. By its third weekend, the film remained at number one in some territories, being overtaken by The Angry Birds Movie in others, and became the top film of 2016 and fourth-highest-grossing superhero film outside of North America.|$|E

40|$|This article {{shows that}} women’s rising {{earnings}} contributed to reducing inequality <b>in</b> household <b>earnings,</b> {{with respect to}} couples. We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) on 1, 148, 762 coupled households, covering 18 OECD countries and the period from 1973 to 2013. In this period, women’s share of household earnings grew, spouses’ earnings became more strongly and positively correlated in various countries, and inequality <b>in</b> women’s <b>earnings</b> was reduced. Inequality <b>in</b> household <b>earnings</b> increased due to the rising correlation between spouses’ earnings, but was reduced more by the decline of inequality <b>in</b> women’s <b>earnings.</b> Had women’s earnings remained unchanged since the 1970 s and 1980 s, inequality <b>in</b> household <b>earnings</b> would have been higher around 2010 in all observed OECD countries. Household inequality was reduced least by trends <b>in</b> women’s <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> countries {{with a long history}} of high female labor-force participation, such as Finland (3 % reduction) and Sweden (5 %), and most in countries that observed a stronger increase in female labor-force participation in recent decades such as Spain (31 %) and the Netherlands (41 %). As more countries are reaching a plateau in the growth of women’s employment and earnings, the potential for further stimulating women’s employment and earnings to counter both women’s and household inequality seems to be increasingly limited...|$|R
