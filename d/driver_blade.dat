40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an articulating endoscopic screw driver {{that can be used to}} place screws in osteosynthetic plates during thoracoscopic surgery. The device is small enough to be used with a 12 mm trocar sleeve and transmits sufficient torque to fully secure bone screws. The articulating joint enables correct screw alignment at obtuse angles, up to 60 ° from the tool axis. A novel articulating joint is presented, wherein a flexible shaft both transmits torque and actuates the joint; antagonist force is provided by a super-elastic spring. Screws are Joseph E Petrzelka MED- 10 - 1046 2 secured against the <b>driver</b> <b>blade</b> during insertion with a retention mechanism that passively releases the screw once it is securely seated in the bone. The prototype has been fitted with a blade compatible with 2. 0 and 2. 3 mm self-drilling screws, though a different <b>driver</b> <b>blade</b> or drill bit can be easily attached. Efficacy of the tool has been demonstrated by thoracoscopically securing an osteosynthetic plate to a rib during an animal trial. This tool enables minimally invasive, thoracoscopic rib fixation...|$|E

The {{main problem}} faced by almost half Selorejo Reservoir area covered by water {{hyacinth}} plant which resulted tergangagunya activities of citizens and farmers around the reservoir. In a grove of water hyacinth plants into a rat's nest. When the water hyacinth leaves turn yellow and die, straight {{down to the bottom}} of the reservoir so as to accelerate siltation. The design goal is to produce a design thrasher wet hyacinth capacity of 350 kg / hour. The method used in this study is the Pahl & Beitz to order literature study to obtain descriptions of existing machines. calculate the capacity of the machine, serves as a cutter knife.

Obtained by the above method calculation results include shaft diameter of 40 mm with a length of 880 mm, for a transmission system using a V-belt and pulley, where the V-belt used type A (1 piece).

50|$|Neon noirs were popularised in the 70’s and 80’s by {{films like}} Taxi <b>Driver</b> (1976), <b>Blade</b> Runner (1982), and David Lynch {{films such as}} Blue Velvet (1986) and later, Lost Highway (1997). In the more current {{cinematic}} landscape, films like Harmony Korine’s highly provocative Spring Breakers, and Danny Boyle’s Trance (2013) have been especially recognised for their neon-infused rendering of the noir genre; Whilst Trance was celebrated for ‘shak(ing) the ingredients (of the noir) like coloured sand in a jar’, Spring Breakers notoriously produced a slew of criticism referring to its ‘fever-dream’ aesthetic and ‘neon-caked explosion of excess’ (Kohn). Another neon-noir endowed with the 'fever-dream' aesthetic is The Persian Connection, expressly linked to Lynchian aesthetics as a neon-drenched contemporary noir.|$|R

The {{goal is to create}} the new generation helicopter prototype till the end of year 2012 and it will be useful in civil aviation in the Europe. This innovative product pays attention to the ecology and low noise level. Here the attention is paid to the gas turbine engine, which doesn’t blow off a lot of pollutants.

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw <b>drivers</b> with <b>blades</b> to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
