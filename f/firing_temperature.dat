Once the fire smoke has been exhausted effectively, the <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> will be reduced and the fire-resistance performance of steel structures may be improved as well.

30|$|Although we {{expected}} pre-burn fuel loads {{to be related}} to patterns of mean <b>fire</b> <b>temperature,</b> this was not consistently true in all plots. This finding contrasts with results of other studies that have found various measures of <b>fire</b> behavior (<b>fire</b> <b>temperature,</b> burn severity, <b>fire</b> intensity) to be correlated with vegetation and fuel heterogeneity (Hobbs et al. 1984, Hobbs and Atkins 1988, Gibson et al. 1990, Rice 1993, Odion and Davis 2000). It is possible that the combined effects of standing biomass, litter, and 1 – 1000 hour fuels on <b>fire</b> <b>temperatures</b> prevented us from seeing strong relationships with any single fuel component. For example, overlaying the distribution of standing fuels and litter in Plot 7 would create a similar pattern as mean <b>fire</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, multiple regression analysis confirmed generally weak relationships between pre-burn fuel loads and mean <b>fire</b> <b>temperature,</b> indicating that other variables were likely contributing factors.|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>temperature</b> during four low-intensity surface {{fires in}} {{longleaf}} pine forest was spatially dependent and varied significantly over medium scales (27 – 157 m). Notably, the specific range of this spatial pattern (patch size) was not consistent, even among fires occurring in relatively similar fuel conditions and burned under similar weather conditions. Patterns of pre-burn fuel loads were only moderately related to patterns of mean <b>fire</b> <b>temperature.</b> Incorporating additional fuel parameters (e.g., fuel moisture) and microscale changes in wind and relative humidity may have explained {{the pattern of}} <b>fire</b> <b>temperatures</b> more completely. Prescribed burns altered the strength and scale of fuel load spatial patterns from pre- to post-burn. However, the pattern of post-burn fuels loads could not be predicted based on <b>fire</b> <b>temperatures</b> or pre-burn fuel loads alone. The low range of <b>fire</b> <b>temperatures</b> experienced during these low-intensity burns may have prevented detecting distinct patterns in vegetation following burns.|$|R

25|$|An {{open circuit}} gas turbine cycle has a compressor, a {{combustor}} and a turbine. For gas turbines {{the amount of}} metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the <b>firing</b> <b>temperature),</b> is relatively high (900 to 1,400°C). The output temperature of the flue gas is also high (450 to 650°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a Rankine cycle).|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} both gas {{and steam}} cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. The {{efficiency of the}} cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. This large range means that the Carnot efficiency of the cycle is high. The actual efficiency, while lower than this, is still {{higher than that of}} either plant on its own. The actual efficiency achievable is a complex area.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the initial <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures</b> (IFT) of pottery from two archaeological sites in Northwest Alaska. Arctic ceramics are consistently described as low-fired technology in archaeological and ethnographic literature. However, regional and temporal variation in the quality and hardness of arctic ceramics suggests variation in <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> To describe all Arctic pottery as low-fired ignores variation in <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures</b> and ultimately in the production process. Sherds from two archaeological locales, the Cape Krusenstern site complex and the Ahteut village site, were selected to represent sites with differential access to fuel resources. IFT’s were estimated by measuring color change in a stepwise refiring experiment. Preliminary results indicate {{that a majority of}} sherds from Cape Krusenstern had lower initial <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures</b> than did sherds from Ahteut. Additionally, this experiment indicates that (1) a majority of the sherds contained residual organic content, (2) shows the effects of the presence of organic content on a refiring experiment, and (3) confirms that vessels from these two sites were originally fired under reducing atmospheres. These results do provide {{a better understanding of the}} production process of arctic ceramics. The difference between the initial firing atmosphere and the refiring atmosphere, as well as the presence of organic content, may be masking the true indications of initial <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Because of these confounding factors additional research, including alternative methods of estimating initial <b>firing</b> <b>temperatures,</b> are necessary.

25|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) {{and covered with}} a glaze made with lead and other minerals. This is because lead will fuse and produce a shine at a <b>firing</b> <b>temperature</b> of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high. The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends to leach into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, Oaxaca and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery. This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.|$|E

In a laboratory experiment we assessed a critical knowledge gap: how <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> and live fuel moisture (LFM) influences ignitability, sustainability, combustibility and consumability of J. virginiana. Percentage occurrence of ignition rose as <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> increased. The time to ignition increasedwhile {{the occurrence of}} ignition decreasedwith increasing LFM.

2500|$|Fritware {{refers to}} a type of pottery which was first {{developed}} in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. Frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1. This type of pottery has also {{been referred to as}} “stoneware" [...] and “faience” among other names. A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from Baghdad has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments. The lack of “inclusions of crushed pottery” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze. The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low <b>firing</b> <b>temperature,</b> and thus increase the hardness and density of the [...] body.” ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Fire {{is a key}} {{controlling}} factor in ecosystem dynamics worldwide, especially, in tropical areas under slash-and-burn agricultural systems. Farmers use fire {{as a tool to}} clean the land, and benefit from nutrient enrichment from ash-soil heating. However, fire can cause some detrimental effects on soil systems, such as organic carbon depletion, increased soil erodibility, and changes to aggregate stability. In this study, an experimental fire was applied to a plot of land following the local traditional practice of slash-and-burn. The <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> was monitored in the field, and its effect on soil aggregate stability was assessed. The <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> on soil surface was measured in four trenches, and it ranged from 355 to 660 °C (average 484 ± 142 °C). The <b>fire</b> <b>temperature</b> did not affect soil organic matter content. However, aggregate stability increased by 10 % in comparison to unburned soil.
