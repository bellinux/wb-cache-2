25|$|Actually {{for some}} experts (like Tripodi) the {{question}} arises <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{could get to the}} end {{in such a short time}} and without major incidents: no loss of life happened. Fascist propaganda pinpointed that the dam was done without enhancing the distinction of class or color - although the work was done in very difficult conditions.|$|E

25|$|The station {{itself was}} {{refurbished}} in 1986 {{with a new}} booking office. A few years later the canopy was renewed. This saw the removal of a few bays of the canopy at {{the east end of}} the station, and the replacement of the hipped canopy by a simpler modern design, although the original cast iron columns support this. Some hipped bays remain on the road side of the station entrance as a reminder of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> once looked.|$|E
25|$|The show ends on a {{high and}} in a similar style to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began. At Fiona's mansion {{boarding}} house, a young couple arrive, {{and ask for a}} room. The young woman is heavily pregnant. Fiona takes them in, just as she had with David and Patricia all those years ago. The woman gives birth to twins, {{a boy and a girl}} and the story seems to have finally come full circle. The final episode ends with a montage of many cast members, both past and present.|$|E
25|$|The Riverworld series {{originated}} in a novel, Owe for the Flesh, written {{in one month}} in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, but the book was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, {{a copy of a}} revised version of the original novel surfaced in a box in a garage and was published as River of Eternity by Phantasia Press in 1983. Farmer's Introduction to this edition gives the details of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> happened.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{while at}} Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored {{and starred in}} the play <b>How</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Began, which was {{performed}} at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments. In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) {{came in the form}} of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving; it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled My Edens After Burns, that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.|$|E
500|$|Though he was {{considered}} one of the front-runners, there was still much competition for one of the limited 2013 bullpen spots as a relief pitcher. His main competition was seen as Brett Cecil and J. A. Happ. John Gibbons said, [...] "How it best fits the team, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> stacks up down there is really what it's going to come down to. But we're going to go with the best guy, not because guys are out of options."

500|$|Joshua Alston of Newsweek {{criticized the}} episode and the {{introduction}} of the Charles character. Although Alston said Elba's acting was fine, he said the character [...] "sucked the funny out of every scene he was in" [...] and created an awkwardness inappropriate for the show. During the week following the episode's original broadcast, many fans theorized on the Internet that Michael said [...] "I acquit" [...] rather than [...] "I quit", and that Michael's supposed resignation was something of a prank. Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam on The Office, addressed this issue on her MySpace blog, saying, [...] "He said 'I quit'. [...] And he meant it.

Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the [...] "...context and history of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> came to be" [...] and [...] "...respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [...] because you probably won't see anything like it again."

500|$|Reviewers of {{the first}} three episodes {{interpreted}} Carnivàles story as being full of myth and allegory. The show was seen as more than just a human-scaled metaphor of good and evil, with the power of spirits as one of the show's strongest elements. Some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as [...] "mysterious" [...] the characters and their powers and abilities, characters and scenarios within visions, the whole carnival [...] wondering <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> fit together. The visions of the two main characters were shortly addressed, distinguishing between violent and benign visions, but parallels between the visions and the beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn. The characters' stories were described as unfolding in [...] "zig-zagging starts, moving back and forth in time and space, dropping oblique clues along the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{example that}} {{mentions}} Ælfgar shows {{a different kind}} of unreliability in the Chronicle: that of omission. Ælfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in that year was exiled again. This time only [...] has anything to say: [...] "Here Earl Ælfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from Norway; it is tedious to tell <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> happened." [...] In this case other sources exist to clarify the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [...] says nothing at all, and [...] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that when the Chronicle is silent, other sources that report major events must be mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the Chronicle does omit important events.|$|E
500|$|While {{shooting}} the episode, Jorge Garcia noted [...] "the {{group on the}} beach has been quite big. They laid out the most cast chairs I've ever seen at one time since the pilot and it's been fun." [...] Garcia previewed his character's flashback in a New York Post interview, [...] " [...] the kind of relationship Hurley has {{with his father and}} how it's changed from {{when he was a kid}} now that he's an adult and a lottery winner. He finds something on the island that brings him back to that time and that's <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> gets started". Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate. Holloway commented that Sawyer is thinking I have [...] "my beer... but I don't have my girl. He's worried, and drowning it with beer".|$|E

"Bounce" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} as a digital extended play (EP)—which included a remix by DJ Green Lantern—on 27 May 2013 in selected {{countries such as}} France, while the release in several other countries were postponed to a later date. The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I {{was one of these}} people too– is that they think they work in the industry and know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> works. They're like, 'put 'Bounce' out now or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'. It's coming out on July 8 and I need fans to trust their fave on this one because it's for the best. I need to hashtag that– #trustyourfaves."

500|$|Sam Wollaston for The Guardian said he {{was missing}} the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, {{and that the only}} fun in the drama was [...] "recognising the nods, working out who's who and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite {{a lot of the time}} you were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you".

SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall praised Joshua Jackson and Lance Reddick's performances, giving Jackson [...] "top honors" [...] as he [...] "once again shows us the fangs behind that cherubic smile". Stegall also noted the allusions to The X-Files, which included an episode playing during the first shapeshifter's transformation, [...] "Which is fine, as far as I'm concerned. If I can't have Mulder and Scully, I'll take Walter and Peter, and even Astrid and Charlie... I'm happy to see another show on TV that deals with the unknowable and the possibly fascinating, with an actual budget in hand.
