50|$|The {{end result}} was that the {{government}} must prove an intent to <b>defraud</b> the <b>tax</b> system, not merely that Snider made an untrue statement. The majority then concluded that Snider's claiming three billion adjustments was so clearly {{outside the realm of}} possibility {{that there was no way}} a jury could conclude that he intended to deceive his employer or the IRS into giving him credit for three billion adjustments.|$|R
50|$|First in March 2015 {{and again}} in February 2016, Gerdau’s offices in Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, Recife and Porto Alegre, the company’s headquarters, were raided by the Brazilian federal police. Part of Operation Zealots, a probe into tax fraud, Gerdau was summoned to testify on {{suspicion}} that “executives bribed <b>tax</b> authorities, <b>defrauded</b> Brazil's <b>tax</b> revenue service of $429 million, laundered illegal funds and carried out influence peddling”. In defense, the company said in a securities filing it had legally hired external experts for technical advise. However, Johannpeter agreed {{to appear in court}} voluntarily.|$|R
500|$|Mayor Richard M. Daley {{criticized the}} Park Grill deal, blaming Chicago's Corporation Counsel Mara Georges, saying that {{lawyers for the}} city and the Chicago Park District erred and that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. [...] "Lawyers do make mistakes," [...] Daley said. [...] "That's what it was. ... It's {{embarrassing}} to them. Yes it is - the corporation counsel and the Park District counsel." [...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for <b>defrauding</b> <b>tax</b> payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the [...] "Clout Cafe" [...] and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals.|$|R

50|$|He was prosecuted at the Old Bailey for {{submitting}} false {{income tax}} returns in 1954. The prosecuting counsel was Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, the Solicitor General and later Speaker of the House of Commons; {{counsel for the}} defence was Frederick Lawton, later a senior judge. Megarry's tax affairs were complex, with his earnings as a lecturer dealt with by {{his wife and his}} self-employed income from his legal practice dealt with by his clerk. Each assumed that the other was dealing with certain items of income, but in fact neither did, so it was omitted from Megarry's tax returns. The judge directed the jury to acquit Megarry, {{on the grounds that the}} error was a genuine mistake with no intention to <b>defraud</b> the <b>tax</b> authorities.|$|R
40|$|Tax {{agents are}} {{responsible}} for assisting taxpayers to submit tax returns for individual, company, {{and other types of}} tax returns and to prepare business activity statements for business taxes, including goods and services taxes or GST. Unfortunately, some agents abuse their positions of trust to <b>defraud</b> the <b>tax</b> system. One way they do this is by inflating the busi-ness deductions of their clients. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is responsible for identifying high-risk tax agents who are engaging in unaccept-able practice. The methods described in this paper were aimed at identifying high-risk agents. In this paper, we report some results from modelling tax agent behavior using a distance-from-the-centroid (DFC) method with assistance from a ge-netic algorithm (GA). DFC is an example of what are called “instance-based learning methods. ” These use known high-risk cases, or instances, to see if other cases have practice profiles that are similar to them. DFC works simply by identifying the center of gravity or centroid of a collection of known high-risk cases and then finds other cases not previously classified that are close in distance to the centroid. GAs are ideal for problem...|$|R
5000|$|On 19 February 2009, the US {{government}} {{filed suit}} against UBS to reveal {{the names of all}} 52,000 American customers, alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to <b>defraud</b> the US <b>tax</b> authority IRS of legitimately owed tax revenue. [...] However revealing of customer names was contrary to Swiss law and put UBS in a difficult position. Eventually UBS with the support of FINMA agree to provide the names of 250 to 300 clients through FINMA and pay a U.S. $780 million of fine as settlement. FINMA used a section of the Act provided for situations where a bank is threatened with bankruptcy to allow this to happen. Subsequently, in February 2009 the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland ordered FINMA to stop the transmission to the U.S. tax authorities. However it is believed that data from 250 UBS clients had already been transmitted.|$|R
