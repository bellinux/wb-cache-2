Other than the IAI, other programmes {{for the development of the}} Mekong Basin—where all four newer ASEAN members are located—that tend to focus on infrastructure development were enacted. In general, ASEAN does not have the financial resources to extend substantial grants or loans to the new members. Therefore, it usually leaves the financing of these infrastructure projects to international financial institutions and to developed countries. Nevertheless, it mobilised funding from these institutions and countries, and from the ASEAN-6 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, and Thailand) themselves, for areas where the development gap needs to be bridged through the IAI programme. Other programmes intended for the development of the ASEAN-4 take advantage of the geographical proximity of the CLMV (Cambodia-Laos-Myanmar-Vietnam) countries and tend to focus on infrastructure development in areas like transport, tourism, and power transmission.|$|E

40|$|Although {{immigrant}} <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> {{have long}} been hypothesized {{to be associated with}} majority members’ anti-immigrant sentiments, systematic empirical research exploring this relationship is largely absent. To address this gap in the literature, the present research takes a cross-national perspective. Drawing from theory and research on group conflict and intergroup norms, we conduct two studies to examine whether preexisting <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> that are more permissive promote or impede majority group members’ subsequent negative attitudes regarding immigrants. For several Western and Eastern European countries, we link country-level information on immigrant <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> from 2006 with individual-level survey data from the Eurobarometer 71. 3 collected in 2009 (Study 1) and from the fourth wave of the European Value Study collected between 2008 and 2009 (Study 2). For both studies, the results from multilevel regression models demonstrate that immigrant <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> that are more permissive are associated with decreased perceptions of group threat from immigrants. These findings suggest that immigrant <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are of key importance in improving majority members’ attitudes regarding immigrants, which is widely considered desirable in modern immigrant-receiving societies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{diffusion}} of civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe, which requires immigrants by certain category of entry to accomplish integration tests for acquisition of residence. Despite a flurry of literature based on civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> attention drawn to the implication of these policies has been quite rare. This thesis examines how civic integration strategies associate with immigration, and tests if civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are connected to variations of immigration by certain category of entry. I argue in this thesis that the conditional factor in civic <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> creates a barrier for affected migrants and their possibility to gain long term residence in the host country.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to interrelate <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> with self-organisation and to find ways for spatial {{planners}} to enlarge the role of self-organisation. The role of self-organisation for refugee integration is promising {{because it has a}} deep understanding of the spatial context and responds to the local needs. Research about <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> {{on the one hand and}} self-organisation and spatial planning on the other hand puts forward the relevance of spatial planning to complement <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> with self-organisation, because spatial planning is a way of planning that strives for <b>policy</b> <b>integration</b> and incorporation of the spatial context. Spatial planning has a competence to provide supportive organisational and spatial conditions, although literature research about those conditions for the role of self-organisation in <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in particular is hardly present yet. This research investigates organisational and spatial conditions in the context of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. First, this thesis gives a theoretical understanding of refugee <b>integration,</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> and spatial planning and self-organisation. Then, it explores the complementarities between <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> and self-organisation by a case-study analysis for Rotterdam. The case-study analysis consists of an analysis of <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> of a thematic analysis that analyses common patterns and characteristics of eleven existing self-organised initiatives in Randstad municipalities and of an in-depth case analysis that goes more deeply into the development processes of three initiatives in Rotterdam. Finally, the thesis proposes general principles to enhance the interrelations between <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> and self-organisation, which are illustrated by a spatial planning strategy for Rotterdam. The results show that integration of refugees takes place in multiple domains simultaneously that require tailor-made support and distinct approaches per domain. The design principles propose that planners define either a policy or a self-organisation approach per domain of integration, in which planners play a collaborating role in the first and a facilitating role in the latter. Accordingly, the principles propose that municipalities coordinate the provision of tailor-made organisational support to self-organisation actors on multiple levels and in multiple domains. Furthermore, the principles propose to provide a network of buildings for self-organisation, consisting of three keystone buildings where initiatives cluster and typical buildings for self-organisation in all neighbourhoods. By deciding on strategic locations where integration is challenging or where relevant actors are located, planners can encourage the emergence and development of self-organisation at desired locations.

30|$|While {{there are}} {{theoretical}} and normative arguments supporting either perspective, there is surprisingly little empirical {{study of the}} relationship between naturalisation and <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> for immigrants. Both camps rarely consider whether the extension of rights to foreigners is also more likely in countries where immigrants have greater access to naturalisation. Even in comparative empirical studies, the links between naturalisation <b>policies</b> and <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> are more often assumed than tested. We find both international policy indicators or indexes focused on naturalisation policies (e.g. Howard 2009; Goodman, 2010; Janoski, 2010; Koning, 2011), as well as those measuring both or either naturalisation and other <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> (Waldrauch and Hofinger 1997; Huddleston, Niessen and Ni Chaoimh, 2010; Ruhs, 2011; Banting and Kymlicka, 2013; Koopmans et al., 2012; see also Helbling 2013 for a more general discussion).
