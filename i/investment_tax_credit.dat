These <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> {{were expected to}} promote the creation of jobs and business investment. This dissertation, using the CGE model of Nebraska, analyzes the effectiveness of <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> in the State of Nebraska. ^ I conducted seven simulations in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> The simulations were divided into two groups. First, I simulated the effects of an additional $ 100 million in <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> that were offset by reducing government spending or that were financed by increasing other taxes. Second, I conducted the simulations with alternative <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rates: a flat <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rate and optimized <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rates. ^ A main finding is that there is no significant evidence that additional <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> will significantly stimulate state income. The model predicts that an additional $ 100 million in <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> generally increases gross investment by about $ 40 million and also increases the capital stock by about $ 600 million. These amounts represent about 1 % from initial levels. ^ The simulation with optimized <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rates reveals the most effective industrial sectors for <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> credits: (1) Chemicals, (2) Utility, (3) Wholesale, (4) Bank, (5) Insurance, (6) Real Estate, (7) Other Financial, (8) Other Services and (9) Business Services. When <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> are concentrated in those sectors, the model predicts that total state income increases by about $ 50 million. ...|$|R

The results show that privately held firms {{are more likely than}} listed firms to choose shareholder <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> and forego corporate tax benefits. Listed firms with relatively high earnings response coefficients tend to choose a corporate 5 -year tax exemption, as it can enhance reported after-tax earnings. Further, in the 5 -year period following their choice of a particular tax incentive, firms choosing a corporate 5 -year tax exemption exhibit significantly lower earnings persistence than those choosing shareholder <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that stock market pressure has a significant effect on firms’ choices between corporate and shareholder tax benefits, and that the choice of tax incentives has an effect on future earnings quality...|$|R

2500|$|Canadian {{technology}} companies have attracted interest {{from the global}} venture capital community partially {{as a result of}} generous tax incentive through the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR) <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> program.

Because the CCPC rules require a minimum of 50% Canadian ownership in the company performing R, foreign investors who would like to benefit from the larger 35% tax credit must accept minority position in the company, which might not be desirable.

40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{empirical}} framework {{for assessing the}} effects of tax policy on an array of producer decisions about output supplies and input demands in Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey. They specify and estimate a dynamic production structure model with imperfect competition for selected industries in these countries. The model results suggest that tax policy affected production and investment and further that selective tax incentives such as <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> <b>investment</b> allowances, and accelerated capital consumption (depreciation) allowances are more cost effective at promoting investment than more general tax incentives such as corporate tax rate reductions. The long run cost effectiveness of these incentives - except corporate tax rate reductions, which proved cost ineffective in all cases - varies by country. In Turkey, investment allowances and capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In Mexico, neither <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> nor accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In contrast, in Pakistan, both <b>investment</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> and accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In the intermediate run, defined as tax policy impact after one year, only the investment allowances and accelerated capital consumption allowances available to Turkish industries proved cost effective. To make selective tax incentives more effective, investmenttax credits must be refundable and carrying forward investment depreciation allowances must be permitted. If stimulating investment expenditure is the sole objective of tax policy, reducing the corporate tax rate is not a cost effective instrument to achieve this objective.
