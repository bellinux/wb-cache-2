The outer zone is that which <b>joins</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean. The inner zone is inland where rivers <b>join</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ria. Another way to refer to these two zones is <b>with</b> <b>the</b> terms [...] "mouth" [...] and [...] "head".

5|$|Elizabeth's {{foreign policy}} was largely defensive. The {{exception}} was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, {{which ended in}} failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies <b>joined</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off {{in the war against}} Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.|$|E
