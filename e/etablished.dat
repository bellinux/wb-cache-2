Therefore, characteristic image features are extracted which can be compared efficiently. We analyse three feature extraction methods and five feature similarity measures. The evaluation is based on two datasets recorded under real conditions. The computations are performed on a Nokia N 95 mobile phone, which is mounted on the quadrocopter.

40|$|Hardness {{measurements}} have {{a significant}} role in mechanical metrology, as they are frequently used to characterise materials properties relevant to industrial processes. A recently introduced method, called Martens Hardness, is based on force and indentation records obtained during a test cycle; the Force/Depth Curve, which describes the indetation pattern, is typically formed by two parts having a zero-point in common. A segmented regression model is proposed in this paper, based on the introduction of a threshold parameter in order to estimate the unknown zero-point. The problem is not trivial, since the relationship between observed force and indentation depth is structural and, moreover, the number of nuisance parameters grows with the number of measured data. The asymptotic likelihood theory leads to an estimate of the unknown parameters of the model. Monte Carlo simulations are resorted to in order to analyse the properties of estimators under different hypotheses about measurement errors, and to <b>etablish</b> the applicability conditions of the method propose...|$|R

Between 1920 and 1928, the rules stated that an additional extra time (two periods of 15 minutes each) should be played to determine finals, that were tied after full time (90 minutes). In 1929, the rules were changed, so that a replay match was scheduled, if a semi-final or final match was tied.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} define several notions of security. This notions will be applicated only on {{symmetric}} encryption scheme specily {{in a concrete}} security framework. The first notion is Left-or-Right Indistinguishability which considers two string with the same lenght x 0 and x 1 and a left-or-right oracle. To summarize, we take a bit b and encrypt x 0 if b= 1 or x 1 if b= 0. The challenge for the adversary is to guess the value of b. The second notion is Real-or-Random Indistinguisability. The idea is that an adversary cannot distinguish an encrypted text with an encryption of an equal-lenght string of garbage. Then, we have the Find-then-Guess Security which is an adaption of the polynomial security. The last notion is semantic security, It is presented saying that whatever can be efficiently computed about a plaintext given the cyphertext can also be computed in absence of the ciphertext.

40|$|We {{propose to}} realize a mass gap in QCD not {{imposing}} the transversality condition {{on the full}} gluon self-energy, while preserving the color gauge invariance condition for the full gluon propagator. Since due to color confinement the gluon is not a physical state, none of physical observables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a temporary violation of color gauge invriance/symmetry. In {{order to make the}} existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the corresponding subtraction procedure is introduced. All this llows one to <b>etablish</b> the general structure of the full gluon propagator {{in the presence of a}} mass gap. It is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of massless gluon modes. The physical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible for the large-scale (low-energy/momentum), i. e., nonperturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum. The direct nonlinear iteration solution of the transcendental equation for the full gluon propagator in the presence of a mass gap is present. We formulate a generl method how to restore the transversality of the full gluon propagator relevant for the nonperturbative QCD. It is explicitly shown that such a solution confines QCD. The exact and gauge-invariant criterion of gluon confinement is derived. The gauge-invariant quark confinement criterion is also formulated.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study pricing of {{differential}} services and its impact on the choice of service priority at equilibrium. We consider both TCP connections as well as non controlled (real time) connections. The performance measures (such as through-put and loss rates) are determined according to the operational parameters of a RED buffer management. The latter is assumed to be able to give differentated services to the applications according to their choice of service class. We consider a best effort type of service differentiation for both TCP as well as real-time traffic where the QoS of connections is not guaranteed, but by choosing a better (more expensive) service class, the QoS parameters of a session can improve (as long as the service class of other sessions are fixed). The choice of a service class of an application will depend both on the utility as well as on the cost it has to pay. We first study the performance of the system as a function of the connections'parameters and their choice of service classes. We then study the decision problem of how to choose the service classes. We model the problem as a noncooperative game. We <b>etablish</b> conditions for an equilibrium to exist and to be uniquely defined. We further provide conditions for convergence to equilibrium from non equilibria initial states. We finally study the pricing problem of how to choose prices so that the resulting equilibrium would maximize the network benefit...|$|R

In spite of this the context that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s are situated in can constitute a discource whereby the object is securized anyway.

40|$|The thesis {{began as}} a study of new firm formation. Preliminary {{research}} suggested that infant death rate {{was considered to be}} a closely related problem and the search was for a theory of new firm formation which would explain both. The thesis finds theories of exit and entry inadequate in this respect and focusses instead on theories of entrepreneurship, particularly those which concentrate on entrepreneurship as an agent of change. The role of information is found to be fundamental to economic change and an understanding of information generation and dissemination and the nature and direction of information flows is postulated to lead coterminously to an understanding of entrepreneurhsip and economic change. The economics of information is applied to theories of entrepreneurhsip and some testable hypotheses are derived. The testing relies on <b>etablishing</b> and measuring the information bases of the founders of new firms and then testing for certain hypothesised differences between the information bases of survivors and non-survivors. No theory of entrepreneurship is likely to be straightforwardly testable and many postulates have to be established to bring the theory to a testable stage. A questionnaire is used to gather information from a sample of firms taken from a new micro-data set established as part of the work of the thesis. Discriminant Analysis establishes the variables which best distinguish between survivors and non-survivors. The variables which emerge as important discriminators are consistent with the theory which the analysis is testing. While there are alternative interpretations of the important variables, collective consistency with the theory under test is established. The thesis concludes with an examination of the implications of the theory for policy towards stimulating new firm formation...|$|R

Fourth, potential solutions that can be offered to overcome the problems arising in the application offair value. This research used a fenomenology intepretif approach. The informants consisted of seven auditors accounting educators who work at Public Accounting firms in Semarang. Data obtained using deep and direct interviews and were analyzed using techniques of analysis suggested by Moustakas (1994). The results showed that all informants can explain how to estimate fair value.

40|$|Many {{physical}} problems, {{for example}} the behaviour of a compressible fluid, can be modelled as systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, d/dt U + div. F(U) = 0, if certain effects (for instance viscosity) are neglected. One of the first computational schemes for systems of conservation laws was introduced by Godunov in 1959. This scheme is based on exactly solving a Riemann problem at each cell interface and then projecting the solution back onto the space of piecewise constant functions after some finite time step. A major drawback of Godunov's scheme is the necessity to solve all the Riemann problems exactly, which usually consists of an iterative process. To overcome this handicap, there {{were in the past}} many ideas for so-called approximate Riemann solvers, i. e. procedures to obtain a suitable approximation to the solution of a Riemann problem. In principle, the idea of Godunov's scheme is at first only applicable to problems in one space dimension. However, problems naturally often arise in two or three space dimensions, and some standard techniques to extend the scheme to more space dimensions have been developped. A detailed description of Riemann solvers and Riemann solver based schemes can for example be found in the textbooks of LeVeque, Kröner, Godlewski and Raviart, and Toro. On the other hand, while the numerical treatment of systems of conservation laws (as well as of other differential equations) has been developped and refined more and more and computers have become increasingly powerful, the classical analytical tool of characteristic theory (see for example Courant and Hilbert) seems to have been sunk little by little into oblivion. Since about 15 years, there is an ongoing discussion (see for example Roe et al) whether one-dimensional Riemann solvers do justice to the multi-dimensional effects arising in systems of conservation laws in multi-dimensions. There were a number of approaches which therefore purposely dispensed with Riemann solvers, and some of which were based on the classical characteristic theory. This thesis includes both a recapitulation of some aspects of the multi-dimensional characteristic theory (and therefore hopefully makes for preventing this beautiful theory from being forgotten) and some new analytical connections and differences between three Riemann solver free approaches. In particular, the thesis includes a new and elementary derivation of Noelle's version of Fey's "Method of Transport" (called MoT-ICE in contrast to Fey's version, which we call MoT-CCE), which on the one hand naturally fits into the framework of so-called state decompositions and flux decompositions (in which also the standard finite volume approach can integrated) {{and on the other hand}} is based on the gas-kinetic theory. This <b>etablishes</b> a close connection between the MoT-ICE and the kinetic schemes. Some implementory details for the MoT-ICE and an extensive numerical comparison of the MoT-ICE to a standard, Riemann solver based scheme complete the thesis. This comparison in a way confirms the close connection between the MoT-ICE and the kinetic schemes, but at the same time shows that the MoT-ICE in its current state does not meet the claim of being a reasonable alternative to Riemann solver based schemes...|$|R
