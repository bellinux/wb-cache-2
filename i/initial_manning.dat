40|$|EMBA Project ReportEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: At {{the request}} of the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force, the Naval Air Systems Command‘s program office for Multi-Mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) —also known as PMA- 266, began MQ- 8 B flight {{operations}} in Afghanistan. Due to the importance and short notice of this request, the <b>initial</b> <b>manning</b> and support measures for the Fire Scout detachment has relied heavily on contractors. In an effort to refine and redirect the future manning of Fire Scout detachments, PMA- 266 asked the Washington DC Naval Postgraduate School Consulting Group to evaluate three different courses of action (COAs) detailing manning options for deployment of the MQ- 8 B Fire Scout for the next year. The three COAs were: 1) Manning with a military component 2) Manning with NGC contract services 3) Manning through a third party contractor. This report recommends that PMA- 266 use the military component COA to the maximum extent possible. In addition to annual cost savings of over $ 10 M, a military component provides greater mission-focus and flexibility inherent in a military chain of command as compared to a contract manning structure. The Navy would also benefit by obtaining operational UAS experience as it looks to develop an unmanned aviation community. The experience gained could be used to develop Navy instructors for operator and maintenance training instead of continuing to rely on contract support for these requirements.

40|$|Issues {{relating}} to the selection of initial landing sites for manned Mars missions are discussed from a geological viewpoint. The two prime objectives for <b>initial</b> <b>manned</b> exploration should be the youngest unambiguous lava flows (to tie down the late end of the cratering history curve for Mars) and old highland crust, which is best sampled and studied {{through the use of}} large impact basins as natural, planetary drill-holes. Exploration of these two sites will provide data on Martian chronology, volcanism, impact processes and gross chemical structure that will enable a first-order global synthesis through integration of these results with the global remote-sensing data already in hand from Viking and that to be provided by the Mars Observer Mission...|$|R
50|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>manned</b> spaceflights in {{the early}} 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight {{extension}} of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had {{little in common with}} the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.|$|R

40|$|A {{scenario}} for an <b>initial</b> <b>manned</b> mission to Mars involves transits through the Van Allen Radiation Belts, a 30 day ‘short surface stay’ and a 400 day Cruise Phase (to/from the planet). The {{contribution to the}} total dose incurred through transiting the belts is relatively small and manageable. Estimates of the particle radiation hazard incurred during a 30 day stay on the surface (using ESA's Mars Energetic Radiation Environment Models dMEREM and e MEREM) indicate that the dose {{is not expected to}} be particularly challenging health-wise due to the shielding effect provided by the Martian atmosphere and the body of the planet. This is in accord with estimations obtained using the Langley HZETRN code. Estimates of GCR exposure in free space during the minimum phase of Solar Cycle 23 determined using the CREME 2009 model are in reasonable agreement with published results obtained using HZETRN (which they exceed by about 10...|$|R

25|$|Gentry's {{most notable}} {{contributions}} to flight test occurred {{when he was}} assigned to the lifting body research program in 1965. The lifting body program, operated jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Air Force, performed the <b>initial</b> <b>manned</b> tests to evaluate the feasibility of landing a wingless spacecraft on a pre-determined runway. Gentry was the eighth pilot assigned to the lifting body program and made his first air-towed flight in the NASA M2-F1 on July 16, 1965. He transitioned to the heavyweight Northrop M2-F2 lifting body which he first flew on October 12, 1966 in an unpowered mission air-dropped from a B-52 Stratofortress. By May 1967, he had made five unpowered flights in the M2-F2 to define the vehicle's aerodynamic characteristics in preparation for upcoming rocket-powered supersonic flights. M2-F2 testing ended prematurely when the vehicle crashed on May 10, 1967 severely injuring fellow lifting body test pilot, Bruce Peterson.|$|R
40|$|An {{in-flight}} visibility test {{conducted on}} the Apollo 14 mission is discussed. The need for obtaining experimental data on lunar feature visibility arose from visibility problems associated with {{various aspects of the}} Apollo missions; and especially from anticipated difficulties of recognizing lunar surface features at the time of descent and landing under certain illumination conditions. Although visibility problems have influenced many other aspects of the Apollo mission, they have been particularly important for descent operations, due to the criticality of this mission phase and the crew's guidance and control role for landing site recognition and touchdown point selection. A series of analytical and photographic studies were conducted during the Apollo program (prior to as well as after the <b>initial</b> <b>manned</b> lunar operations) to delineate constraints imposed on landing operations by visibility limitations. The purpose of the visibility test conducted on Apollo 14 was to obtain data to reduce uncertainties and to extend the analytical models of visibility in the lunar environment...|$|R
5000|$|The two {{designs were}} {{reviewed}} from January to March 1942. Reichminister Todt, and later, his replacement Albert Speer, both recommended the DB design to Hitler {{because of its}} advantages over the <b>initial</b> <b>MAN</b> design. At the final submission, MAN refined its design, having learned from the DB proposal apparently through a leak by a former employee in the Wa Pruef 6, senior engineer Heinrich Ernst Kniepkamp and others. [...] On 5 March 1942, Albert Speer reported that Hitler considered the Daimler-Benz design to be superior to MAN's design. A review by a special commission appointed by Hitler in May 1942 selected the MAN design. Hitler approved this decision after reviewing it overnight. One of the principal reasons given for this decision was that the MAN design used an existing turret designed by Rheinmetall-Borsig, while the DB design would have required a brand new turret and engine to be designed and produced, delaying the commencement of production. This time-saving measure compromised the subsequent development of the design.|$|R
