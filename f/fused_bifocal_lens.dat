40|$|SummaryAlmost all animal eyes {{follow a}} few, {{relatively}} well-understood functional plans. Only rarely do researchers discover an eye that diverges fundamentally from known types. The principal eye E 2 of sunburst diving beetle (Thermonectus marmoratus) larvae clearly {{falls into the}} rarer category. On the basis of two different tests, we here report that it has truly <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{something that has been}} previously suggested only for certain trilobites [1]. Our evidence comes from (1) the relative contrast in images of a square wave grating and (2) the refraction of a narrow laser beam projected through the lens. T. marmoratus larvae have two retinas at different depths behind the lens, and these are situated so that each can receive its own focused image. This is consistent with a novel eye organization that possibly comprises “two eyes in one. ” Moreover, we find that in contrast to most commercial <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses,</b> the lens of E 2 exhibits asymmetry, which results in separation of the images both dorsoventrally and rostrocaudally within the layered retina. Visual contrast might thus be improved over conventional <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> because the unfocused version of one image is shifted away from the focused version of the other, an organization which could potentially be exploited in optical engineering...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bifocal</b> {{spectacle}} <b>lenses</b> {{have been}} used as a strategy to slow myopic progression in children since the 1950 s and perhaps earlier.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{we report on}} a unique and ancient type of eye, in which the lower surface of the upper calcite lens units possessed an enigmatic central bulge making the dioptric {{apparatus}} similar to a <b>bifocal</b> <b>lens.</b> This eye belonged to the trilobite Dalmanitina socialis, which became extinct several hundred million years ago. As far as we know, image formation by <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> of this kind did/does not occur in any other ancient or modern animal visual system. We suggest that the function of these <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> may be to enable the trilobite to see simultaneously both very near (e. g. floating food particles and tiny preys) and far (e. g. sea floor, conspecifics, or approaching enemies) in the optical environment through the central and peripheral lens region, respectively. This was the only reasonable function we could find to explain the puzzling lens shape. We admit {{that it is not}} clear whether bifocality was necessary for the animal studied. We show that the misleading and accidental resemblance of an erroneous correcting lens surface (designed by René DesCartes in 1637 [DesCartes, R. (1637). Oeuvres de DesCartes. La Géometrie. Livre 2. pp. 134. J.

While. concentric-design <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> {{have been used for}} at least 40 years, there have been few investigations of the visual or optical peflormances of this form of correction. This study, the second of two parts, examined the effects of lens design, central optic zone diameter (COZD), pupil size and contact lens decentration on the visual petiormance of rigid concentric-design <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lenses.</b> Part I of this study examined the optical per$ormance of the same <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lenses.</b> Ten experimental, rigid, <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> designs with varying COZD and of both Centre-Near (CN) and Centre-Distance (CD) format were investigated. The visual pelrformance offive trained presbyopic subjects was assessed using monitor-based contrast sensitivity, Pelli-Robson contrast thresholds at 4 m, and high- and low-contrast visual acuity, Visual perfrmance was affected by COZD, contact lens decentration, and pupil size. Repeatability of the visual pe$ormance measures was worse than in previous reports and correlated with the relative reduction in visual pelrformance. The low-contrast letter chart was the test most sensitive to differences in <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> design. Pupil coverage by the COZ needed to achieve optimal visual perhormance (equal distance and near vision) varied with visual test, lens decentration and pupil size.

The MTF varied with COZD, aperture size, and decentration. CD lenses were shown to give slightly better optical performance {{with one of the}} two optical performance indices. Differences may have been due to optical aberrations inherent in the back-surface design of these contact lenses. As expected, with increased COZD, optical pe$ormance improved when the central optic zone (COZ) formed the focus, and reduced when the peripheral optic zone formed the&us. With the <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lenses</b> centred over the aperture the optimal aperture coverage of the COZ (equal distance and near optical performance) was found to remain at 37 % of the aperture area for apertures of 3 - 6 mm diameter. Decentration of the <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> over the aperture caused marked changes in both image form and the MTF, which were only partly explained by changes in the proportion of the aperture covered by the COZ. The MTF was shown to be a usefil measure of changes in the optical performance which influence visual per$ormance.

40|$|Although diffractive {{contact lenses}} {{have been well}} {{documented}} in theory, no definitive experimental data have been reported which confirm that the near image is in fact created by diffraction rather than by refraction. We have tested the diffraction hypothesis for one type of diffractive contact lens (the Hydron Echelon bifocal) experimentally by measuring its longitudinal chromatic aberration in isolation and when worn on the eye. The basis of this test is that, according to theory, diffractive lenses should have chromatic aberration which is opposite in sign to that measured for the eye. Objective measurements of chromatic aberration were made with a focimeter when the lens was in a wet cell. Subjective measurements were made with a Badal optometer when the lens was worn on the eye. Four control experiments were conducted to provide baseline measurements of the eye’s chromatic aberration, against which we compared the results obtained for the diffractive contact lens. The data were also compared with conventional measurements of refractive error obtained by standard subjective techniques and by an automated infrared refractor. Our {{results showed that the}} longitudinal chromatic aberration of the diffraction image of the Echelon <b>bifocal</b> <b>lens</b> was about one-half that obtained under the four control conditions: for the naked eye, for the nondiffraction image of the Echelon lens, or for either image of a refractive <b>bifocal</b> contact <b>lens</b> (CIBA Bisoft). These results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that the negative chromatic aberration of a diffractive contact lens should partially cancel the positive chromatic aberration of the human eye. Conversely, {{it would be difficult to}} explain these results on the basis of any other known technique for achromatizing the human eye. We therefore conclude that diffraction is responsible for one of the images formed by the Echelon <b>bifocal</b> <b>lens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{experimentally}} {{compare the}} optical performance of {{three types of}} hydrophobic intraocular lenses (IOLs) : extended depth of focus (TECNIS Symfony), bifocal (TECNIS ZMB 00), and trifocal (FineVision GFree). Setting: Rothschild Foundation Paris, France - Liege Space Center Liège, Belgique Methods: Surface topography was analyzed by optical microscopy. Modulation transfer function (MTF) and spherical aberrations were determined on optical bench for variable pupil apertures and with two cornea models (0 µm and + 0. 28 µm). United States Air Force target imaging was analyzed for different focal points (near, intermediate, and far). Point spread function (PSF) and halos were quantified and compared. Results: All lenses presented step-like optic topography. For a pupil size of = 3 mm, distinctive MTF peaks were observed for all lenses: two peaks for the extended depth of focus and <b>bifocal</b> <b>lenses</b> with + 1. 75 and + 4. 00 diopters (D) addition, respectively, and three peaks for the trifocal lens with + 1. 75 and + 3. 50 addition for intermediate and near vision, respectively. The extended depth of focus and <b>bifocal</b> <b>lens</b> had slightly higher MTF at best focus with the + 0. 28 µm cornea model than with the 0 µm model, whereas the trifocal lens {{was likely to be}} more independent of the corneal spherical aberrations. Conclusions: Each lens appears to rely on light diffraction for optical performance, presenting halos with comparable intensities.
