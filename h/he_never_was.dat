5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 (less {{than two years after}} the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{his former}} seat of power, Osborn regains control of his {{business}} and also buys out the Daily Bugle, humiliating former friend and societal peer J. Jonah Jameson as he no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over Urich's exposé of his time as the Green Goblin, providing faked evidence that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research. However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting {{not only as a}} constant reminder of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time.|$|E

25|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the literature of}} early geography and early conceptions of the earth, all sources lead to Homer, who {{is considered by many}} (Strabo, Kish, and Dilke) as the founding father of Geography. Regardless of the doubts about Homer's existence, one thing is certain: <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> a mapmaker.|$|E
25|$|Socrates says <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> a (paid) teacher; therefore, {{he is not}} {{responsible}} for the corruption of any Athenian citizen. That if he corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward to bear witnesses? That if the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? In point of fact, Socrates indicates relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a sickly}} child {{that was not}} {{expected}} to survive; burial clothing was ordered for him. He survived and, eventually, moved to Ohio. He became a lawyer, and was involved in both the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party. After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Edgerton was invited, by Brown's family, to settle Brown's affairs. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> able to meet with Brown. He had a successful career as a politician, and after his term ended in the Territory of Montana, Edgerton returned to Ohio. He served as a lawyer {{in his home state}} until his death in 1900.|$|E

25|$|Milton Friedman {{was awarded}} the 1976 prize in part {{for his work on}} monetarism. Awarding the prize to Friedman caused {{international}} protests. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial six-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 (less than two years after the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende).

25|$|RCR debuted at the 1969 Talladega 500 as a 1968 Chevy {{numbered}} 13. Childress himself {{drove the}} car, finishing 23rd after suffering axle problems. In 1972, the team {{came back to}} run fourteen races with Childress driving again, but didn't go full-time until 1976 when he would begin using the No. 3. Childress earned eleven top-10 finishes and finished eleventh in points that year. Over the next few years, he posted many top-10s and twice was among the highest top 10 points earners, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> in serious contention to win. In 1981, he decided to end his career before the season ended, and handed his No. 3 ride to the defending Winston Cup champion, Dale Earnhardt, who brought his Wrangler sponsorship with him.|$|E
25|$|In his {{campaign}} in Hispania, Cato behaved {{in keeping with}} his reputation of untiring hard work and alertness. He lived soberly, sharing the food and the labours of the common soldier. Wherever it was possible, he personally superintended the execution of his requisite orders. His movements were reported as bold and rapid, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> negligent in pushing the advantages of victory. The sequence of his operations and their combination in agreement with the schemes of other generals in other parts of Hispania appear to have been carefully designed. His stratagems and manoeuvres were accounted as original, talented, and successful; and the plans of his battles were arranged with expert skill. He managed to set tribe against tribe, benefited himself from native deceitfulness, and took native mercenaries into his pay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{highlight}} of ESPN's {{coverage of this}} draft was a verbal altercation between ESPN draft expert Mel Kiper, Jr. and Indianapolis Colts' GM Bill Tobin. While disputing the Colts pick of linebacker Trev Alberts of Nebraska (when Kiper felt a quarterback such as Trent Dilfer made more sense), Tobin famously said to the ESPN crew [...] "Who in the hell is Mel Kiper, anyway? I mean, here's a guy who criticizes everybody, whoever they take. In my knowledge of him, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> even put on a jockstrap, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a player, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a coach, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a scout, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> an administrator, {{and all of a}} sudden, he's an expert. Mel Kiper has no more credentials to do what he's doing than my neighbor, and my neighbor's a postman and he doesn't even have season tickets to the NFL." [...] Tobin would be fired as Colts GM in 1997 while Kiper is still employed by ESPN. Alberts is considered a draft bust with just four sacks in three seasons; Dilfer, although never a star, had a productive career, including game-managing the Baltimore Ravens to a win in Super Bowl XXXV several years after being drafted. This was also the final draft for both Los Angeles football teams for over two decades; by the 1995 draft, the Raiders had returned to Oakland and the Rams began a 21-year tenancy in St. Louis.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{fret about}} money {{has done it}} all, Margaret," [...] said the wife. [...] "Since the day that Walter's {{shocking}} will <b>was</b> read, <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> himself for an hour. Of course he wouldn't show it to you; but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> has." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|Garmin-Cervélo {{was again}} {{touted as a}} strong team for the season's second monument, the Tour of Flanders, with Hushovd perhaps seen as the strongest of the team's three leaders. Noted in the team's favor was the {{leadership}} of sporting director Peter Van Petegem, twice a winner of this race. On race day, Hammond made the day's first major breakaway group, one which stayed away over the first ten cobbled climbs. Hushovd effectively stayed {{at the front of}} the race most of the day, even chasing back on to the front after puncturing on the Taaienberg. However, attacks from the likes of Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara on the Leberg gapped him off to the point that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> able to rejoin the front of the race. He finished with the second large group on the road, over four minutes down, in 54th place. Garmin-Cervélo had no riders factor into the race's finale; Farrar fared slightly better than Hushovd, leading the first large group across the finish line, but he was a minute and a half down in 12th place. Haussler was over eight minutes back, having never been a factor in the race. After yet another disappointing showing in a major spring classic, one post-race analysis suggested the team should no longer be considered favorites in single-day races.|$|E
500|$|When Higginson {{urged her}} to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could {{formally}} meet for the first time, she declined, writing: [...] "Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town". It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as [...] "a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqué & a blue net worsted shawl." [...] He also felt that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> [...] "with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her." ...|$|E

5000|$|Between September and December 1995, {{he stabbed}} to death and {{mutilated}} four men [...] "for fun". He {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment in November 1996 with a recommendation that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> released.|$|R

500|$|Wilson's [...] "penchant for festivities" [...] is {{also well}} documented. Biographer Clifton Blue Parker {{described}} him as [...] "... the Roaring '20s epitome of a baseball player, primed for an age of American excess ... {{at a time when}} baseball was America's favorite sport." [...] His love of drinking and partying did not endear him to Cubs owner William Wrigley, who abhorred alcohol consumption. (Wilson always insisted that he never played drunk; [...] "hung over, yes; drunk, no.") [...] Manager Joe McCarthy worked hard to shield Wilson from Wrigley, and to keep him on an even keel. [...] "Better than any other manager", wrote sportswriter Frank Graham, [...] "Joe understood Hack, made allowances for him when he failed, and rewarded him with praise when he did well. Joe could be strict and stern with his players ... but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> with Hack, and Hack repaid him by playing as he never had before, nor would again." ...|$|E
500|$|Although shy and {{insecure}} as a teenager, as {{an adult}} Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Goldberg put it: [...] "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." [...] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met {{him when he was}} 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: [...] "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> bad or rude." [...] Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing out that their names are on it, as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in [...] "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. [...] However, Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was [...] "rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was", adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Fatio's theory {{remained}} largely unknown {{with a few}} exceptions like Cramer and Le Sage, because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> able to formally publish his works and he fell under the influence of a group of religious fanatics called the [...] "French prophets" [...] (which belonged to the camisards) and therefore his public reputation was ruined.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the victim's father was an LAPD police officer also {{generated}} suspicions that the district attorney's office was pressured for convictions, with Farris Sr. supposedly enjoying extraordinary access to authorities and attorneys, and using his influence to gain favors for the prosecution.
