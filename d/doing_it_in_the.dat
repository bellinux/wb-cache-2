25|$|Young {{contended that}} he was merely acting {{for the state of}} Minnesota when he sought to enforce its laws. The Court disagreed, holding that when a state {{official}} does something that is unconstitutional, the official cannot possibly be <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of the state, because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution means that the Constitution overrides all the laws of the states, invalidating any contrary laws. Therefore, when a state official attempts to enforce an unconstitutional law, that individual is stripped of his official character. He becomes merely another citizen who can constitutionally be brought before a court by a party seeking injunctive relief.|$|E

During the division's push to Baghdad, Mattis relieved Colonel Joe D. Dowdy, commander of Regimental Combat Team-1. It was such a rare occurrence in the modern military that it made the front page of newspapers. Despite this, Mattis declined to comment on the matter publicly other than to say that the practice of officer relief remains alive, or at least [...] "we are <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marines." [...] Later interviews of Dowdy's officers and men revealed that [...] "the colonel was doomed partly by an age-old wartime tension: Men versus mission—in which he favored his men" [...] while Mattis insisted on execution of the mission to seize Baghdad swiftly.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{the capital}} city of Sol-Falena remains under Godwin control. The battle for it claims the lives of both Sialeeds and Gizel. As she expires, Sialeeds hints at her motives (which her maids confirm, if the player speaks with them later): She knew that, if the Prince had rescued Lymsleia when he first had the chance, things only would have {{returned}} to the way they were before, with the same corrupt nobility holding power struggles. [...] The only way, in her mind, to secure the royal family's hold on the Queendom was to prolong the war such that the nobility would be completely and utterly ruined. [...] By <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Godwins' name, the Prince and Lymsleia could be rid of them without getting their hands dirty. [...] As Gizel dies, felled by the Prince in a duel, he declares that Sialeeds was the only real winner. [...] Lord Marscal, the only remaining Godwin, retreats with the Sun Rune to a nearby mountain range, where he meets the Prince in a showdown to prove that the royals can rule without the power of the Sun Rune. [...] He draws the Rune's power into himself for the final battle with the Rune incarnation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E
