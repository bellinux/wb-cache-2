A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1 m wide with a capacity of 600 L. Some models for small households fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86 cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> may have a small section just to make ice cubes.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (R 744) {{is widely}} used as {{refrigerant}} in supermarkets located in cold weather sites thanks to its negligible environmental impact and its favourable thermo-physical properties. Due to its low critical temperature, transcritical operations in CO 2 refrigeration systems can commonly take place, increasing the energy consumption substantially. On the other hand, the high temperatures reached by the CO 2 in the high pressure heat exchanger (gas cooler) potentially allow recovering {{a large amount of}} heat at different temperature levels according to the supermarket needs. The paper deals with the energy performance evaluation of a R 744 refrigeration system, which provides the selected supermarket with DHW and heating, besides satisfying the cooling load required by the refrigerated and <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>storage</b> equipment.

40|$|About 10 years ago, Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) {{carried out}} a {{feasibility}} study on businesses using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for cold power generation, air separation, cryogenic crushing, <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>storage,</b> and carbonic acid. Recently, an air liquefaction plant started operations near Pyungtaek Receiving Terminal (R/T) and a cryogenic crushing plant is now partially operating near Tongyoung R/T. However, although the business of air separation has already been industrialized, the problem of {{increasing the amount of}} gas sales remains. It has been revealed that there is more increased demand in the gas-phase market than the liquid-phase market, and that there exists a different demand pattern between the air separation plant and the LNG plant. Accordingly, the final object {{of this study is to}} establish a comprehensive business plan on the use of LNG cold energy in which all situations in South Korea are taken into consideration. Here, this report deals mainly with the economical efficiency of LNG cold energy use in South Korea based on several previously published reports. First, we performed an exergy analysis on the process of LNG receiving terminals and obtained the amounts of exergy available in the present process. From the results, the cold power generatio...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{shelf life}} of a food {{can be defined as}} the time period within which the food is safe to consume and/or has an {{acceptable}} quality to consumers. Just like any other <b>food,</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>foods</b> deteriorate during <b>storage</b> by different modes or mechanisms, as summarized in Table 1. Microbes usually are not a problem since they cannot grow at freezing temperatures unless subjected to extensive temperature abuse above the freezing point. Enzymes are a big concern for <b>frozen</b> <b>foods,</b> which can cause flavor change (lipoxygenase) in non-blanched fruits and vegetables and accelerated deterioration reactions in meat and poultry (enzymes released from disrupted membranes during precooking). Cell damage or protein and starch interactions during freezing cause drip and mushiness upon thawing. Discoloration could occur by nonenzymatic browning, bleaching, and freezer burn. Vitamin C loss is often a major concern for frozen vegetables. Physical changes, such as package ice formation, moi...|$|R
40|$|Fung In February 2008, the FDA {{released}} a draft Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) on Listeria monocytogenes and proposed that ready-to-eat (RTE) foods {{that do not}} support the growth of L. monocytogenes may contain up to 100 CFU/g of this pathogen. <b>Frozen</b> <b>foods</b> such as ice cream fall in that category since they are consumed in the frozen state. However, other <b>frozen</b> <b>foods,</b> such as vegetables and seafood that are thawed and served at salad and food bars, may support the growth of Listeria and {{would not be allowed to}} contain 100 CFU/g according to the draft CPG. In the current study, growth curves were generated for L. monocytogenes inoculated onto four thawed frozen foods- corn, green peas, crabmeat, and shrimp- stored at 4, 8, 12, and 20 ºC. Growth parameters, lag phase duration (LPD), and exponential growth rate (EGR) were determined using a two-phase linear growth model and the Square Root Model. The results demonstrated that L. monocytogenes has a very short LPD on these thawed <b>frozen</b> <b>foods</b> during refrigerated <b>storage</b> and that there would be several orders of magnitude of growth (i. e., more than 1. 7 log increase at 4 ºC) of the organism before the product is found to be organolepticall...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the ice content of frozen systems is of the utmost interest for monitoring and controlling <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> production and <b>storage.</b> It is also useful if freezing is an undesirable process. Although there is a well known relation between temperature and ice content, this is of little practical help since the easily measurable superficial temperature is not suitable for this calculation: information on the spatial temperature distribution is required. The speed of sound depends strongly on the physical state of media, briskly varying from water to ice. It is also a function of temperature. An easy and fully feasible method to determine a representative overall temperature of food and the ice content by measuring {{the speed of sound}} through a given sample thickness is here reported. The method is quick and suitable for online monitoring of frozen, freezing and thawing systems, and it can be adapted to a large variety of containers, geometrical situations and water contents.
