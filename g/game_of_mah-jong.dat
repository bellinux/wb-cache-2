50|$|Rummy {{is a group}} <b>of</b> {{matching}} card <b>games</b> {{notable for}} similar gameplay based on matching cards of the same rank or sequence and same suit. The basic goal in any form of rummy is to build melds which consists of sets, {{three or four of}} a kind of the same rank; or runs, three or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. You can also have mixed runs in all types of rummy so long as all 7 cards are in order. The original form of rummy is called Sai rummy, Straight Rummy, Standard Rummy, Traditional Rummy, or Basic rummy. The Mexican <b>game</b> <b>of</b> Conquian is considered by games scholar David Parlett to be ancestral to all rummy games, which itself is derived from a Chinese game called Khanhoo and, going even further back, Mahjong. The Rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century and perhaps as early as the 18th century and is, in fact, the essence <b>of</b> <b>Mah-jong.</b> Rummy is also very popular in India. It is most likely that Indian Rummy is an extension of Gin Rummy and Rummy 500 which originated from the USA. It is played with 13 cards, one or two decks, two or more players and with or without jokers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has yet to}} be {{determined}} whether visual-tactile cross-modal plasticity due to visual deprivation, particularly in the primary visual cortex (V 1), is solely due to visual deprivation or if it is a result of long-term tactile training. Here we conducted an fMRI study with normally-sighted participants who had undergone long-term training on the tactile shape discrimination of the two dimensional (2 D) shapes on Mah-Jong tiles (Mah-Jong experts). Eight Mah-Jong experts and twelve healthy volunteers who were naïve to Mah-Jong performed a tactile shape matching task using Mah-Jong tiles with no visual input. Furthermore, seven out of eight experts performed a tactile shape matching task with unfamiliar 2 D Braille characters. Results When participants performed tactile discrimination <b>of</b> <b>Mah-Jong</b> tiles, the left lateral occipital cortex (LO) and V 1 were activated in the well-trained subjects. In the naïve subjects, the LO was activated but V 1 was not activated. Both the LO and V 1 of the well-trained subjects were activated during Braille tactile discrimination tasks. Conclusion The activation of V 1 in subjects trained in tactile discrimination may represent altered cross-modal responses as a result of long-term training. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Massive Ordnance Penetrator(MOP) {{has been}} {{developed}} to destroy deeply buried nuclear components by controlled release from a B 2 or B 52 airplane. This type of release must be cockpit software controlled by the Tactical Optimal Strategy Game(TOSG) Protocol to optimally determine the war <b>game</b> aspects <b>of</b> the dueling from other countries' MOP releases, and the depth at which the MOP explosions can occur for maximal safety and risk concerns. The TOSG Protocol characteristics <b>of</b> <b>games</b> <b>of</b> strategy, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> optimal strategy and tactical games are defined initially by the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy as a certain series of events, each of which must have {{a finite number of}} distinct results. The outcome <b>of</b> a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy, in some cases, depends on chance. All other events depend on the free decision of the players. A game has a solution if there exist two strategies, which become optimal strategies when each mathematically attains the value <b>of</b> the <b>game.</b> The TOSG Protocol war game tactical problem for a class <b>of</b> <b>games</b> can be mathematically modeled as a combat between two airplanes, each carrying a MOP as the specification of the accuracy of the firing machinery and the total amount of ammunition that each plane carries. This silent duel occurs, because each MOP bomber is unable to determine the number of times its opponent has missed. The TOSG Protocol realizes a <b>game</b> theory solution <b>of</b> the tactical optimal strategy game utilizing the theory <b>of</b> <b>games</b> <b>of</b> timing, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> pursuit, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> time lag, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> sequence, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> maneuvering, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> search, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> positioning and <b>games</b> <b>of</b> aiming and evasion.
