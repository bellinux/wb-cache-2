5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|Cotton was the South's primary export and {{the basis}} of its economy, and the system of {{production}} the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to <b>European</b> <b>nations,</b> but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The Union blockade of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South's military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.|$|E
50|$|After a {{long period}} of peace, Japan rearmed by importing, then {{manufacturing}}, Western weapons, and finally by manufacturing weapons of Japanese design. During the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Japan became the first modern Asian nation to win a war against a <b>European</b> <b>nation.</b> In 1902, it became the first Asian nation to sign a mutual defense pact with a <b>European</b> <b>nation,</b> Britain.|$|R

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military.

The commercial success in Europe enabled the album to debut at position two on Billboards European Top 100 Albums chart, behind Norah Jones' studio album Not Too Late. The DVD of The Confessions Tour has sold more than 1.2 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|As {{concerns}} intensified {{in early}} 2010 and thereafter, leading <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> implemented {{a series of}} financial support measures such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering interest rates and providing cheap loans {{of more than one}} trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).|$|E
5|$|By 1919, the White armies were {{in retreat}} {{and by the}} start of 1920 were {{defeated}} on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extant of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In some cases—such as the north-eastern <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland—the Soviets recognised their independence and concluded peace treaties. In other cases, the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although fighting in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.|$|E

With 21.2 million people, {{government is the}} leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> tend to.|$|E

The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> to defense of Crete. The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E

5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} to {{countries}} at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented <b>European</b> <b>nations</b> from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E

On a standard Holt-Laury criterion, parents of daughters, whether unborn or recently born, become almost twice as risk-averse as parents of sons. The study demonstrates this in longitudinal and cross-sectional data, for fathers and mothers, for babies in the womb and new-born children, and in a West <b>European</b> <b>nation</b> and East <b>European</b> <b>nation.</b> These findings may eventually aid our understanding of risky health behaviors and gender inequalities. ...|$|R
