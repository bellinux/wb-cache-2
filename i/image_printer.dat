40|$|Line {{drawing on}} {{discrete}} graphics {{devices such as}} raster video displays, plotters, and <b>image</b> <b>printers</b> {{is one of the}} fundamental operations in computer graphics. Real-time interactive applications or high speed image output (such as on a Postscript laser printer) may require line drawing speeds in the millions of pixels per second. Such demands, which are ever increasing, push the efficiency of line generation. For nearly thirty years Bresenham's algorithm has been the standard which subsequent efforts in line drawing have sought to surpass. This work can be broadly classified into three groups: parallel algorithms which divide line generation over multiple processing units; multi-point algorithms which output a fixed number of pixels in each iteration with fewer decision tests per pixel; and structural methods, including run-length algorithms, which identify periodic patterns in raster lines {{to reduce the number of}} decision tests or even to eliminate them. This paper describes a hybrid method which uses structural properties of raster lines, such as runs, to improve the efficiency of multi-point line generation. A quadruple-step algorithm is developed which requires fewer decision tests than other multi-point algorithms, while retaining the multi-point's advantage in pixel output efficiency, particularly when implemented in hardware. A hardware state-machine circuit is described which efficiently implements the algorithm and outputs a four pixel segment every machine cycle...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the {{accuracy and reliability}} of radiographic methods for assessment of the marginal bone level around oral implants in human cadavers. METHODS: In three human cadavers two implants were placed according to the Instruction Manual for the Brånemark System. One implant was installed in the canine {{and one in the}} premolar region of the left mandible. For each implant, conventional and digital intra-oral paralleling radiography were performed. Digital images were printed with a Kodak 1200 Distributed Medical <b>Imaging</b> <b>printer</b> on blue transparent film, glossy and plain paper. Furthermore, digital scanographic, panoramic and tomographic images were taken with the Cranex Tome multimodal X-ray unit and printed on Agfa Drystar TM 1 B transparent films. All images were evaluated by five dental specialists. Data were statistically compared with real measurements of the marginal bone level on the human cadavers, performed by the same group of observers. Intra- and inter-observer variability were determined. RESULTS: Digital intra-oral images on glossy paper showed the smallest absolute difference between real and measured bone level, followed by digital intra-oral images on film and on plain paper, conventional intra-oral images on analogue film, panoramic, scanographic and tomographic images on film. The difference between real and radiographic measurements was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) for all radiographic techniques. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was high for all techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The selected imaging techniques showed an acceptable accuracy for peri-implant bone level measurements with an overall error of less than 0. 5 mm. Intra-oral images showed the smallest absolute differences. status: publishe...|$|R

This creates the illusion of more colors. A new error diffusion method is presented in which the adaptive recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is used.

40|$|Abstract —Digital halftoning is {{a process}} to convert a continuous-tone image into a binary image with black and white dots. This process is {{necessary}} to print a continuous-tone <b>image</b> using <b>printers.</b> The Error Diffusion {{is one of the}} most popular methods of digital halftoning, because it can generates high quality output images with relatively low computing time. Binary images generated by the Error Diffusion are fine grained in the sense that they have a lot of isolated small black and white dots. However, fine binary images are not appropriate for practical printing, because isolated black and white dots may disappear by dot-gain or dot-loss. Hence cluster-dot halftoning, which generates binary images has no isolated black and white dots are important. It is known that the Error Diffusion with some feedback operation can generate clustered-dot binary images. However, the resulting binary images have strong directional characteristic, which spoils the printing results. The main contribution of this paper is to presents new filters of the Error Diffusion for cluster-dot halftoning with no directional characteristic. Quite surprisingly, it can generate cluster-dot binary images with no directional characteristic using our new filter. Also, the size of cluster can be adjusted by an additional feedback operation. The experimental results show that the Error Diffusion using our new filter can generate better quality binary images than the previously published know results...|$|R
40|$|Grayscale halftoning is the {{technique}} of approximating a grayscale image by a black-and-white <b>image.</b> Black-and-white <b>printers</b> use halftoning to replicate grayscale images on paper. The printers have only the black of ink and the white of paper as the colors at their disposal. Although the printers may vary the size of dots they drop, they cannot vary {{the intensity of the}} droplets. All droplets are black. The printers therefore actually produce black-and-white halftones instead of grayscale prints. The task is to make the black-and-white image indistinguishable from the grayscale one. We consider a halftoned image to be a good approximation to the original grayscale in the obvious sense: perceptually, the images look like one another. How to quantify this metric, however, is less than obvious. A complete model for the human visual system is an open research problem and must take many things into account: for example, how the eye blurs together nearby pixels, the sensitivity of the eye to changes in texture and luminescence, the attenuated response of the eye to changes along diagonal directions, and how optical illusions fool the brain. Understanding that the approximation problem must take into account visual perception, we define the grayscale halftoning problem: The Halftoning Problem Given a grayscale image I, find a black and white image O that minimizes �G(O) − G(I) � 2, where G(·) is the image perceived when viewing ·...|$|R

In this paper we present and analyze a simple, yet optimal, error-diffusion parallel algorithm for digital halftoning and we discuss an implementation on a parallel machine. In particular, we describe implementations on data-parallel computers that contain linear arrays and two-dimensional meshes of processing elements. Our algorithm runs in 2 ·n+m parallel steps, a considerable improvement over the 10 ·m·n sequential algorithm.

50|$|However, {{the cost}} of {{implementation}} was high; computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster <b>image</b> at the <b>printer's</b> natural resolution. This required high performance microprocessors and ample memory. The LaserWriter used a 12 MHz Motorola 68000, making it faster {{than any of the}} Macintosh computers to which it attached. When the laser printer engines themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal. But as printer mechanisms fell in price, {{the cost of}} implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost; in addition, with desktop computers becoming more powerful, it no longer made sense to offload the rasterisation work onto the resource-constrained printer. By 2001, few lower-end printer models came with support for PostScript, largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non-PostScript ink jet printers, and new software-based methods to render PostScript images on the computer, making them suitable for any printer; PDF, a descendant of PostScript, provides one such method, and has largely replaced PostScript as de facto standard for electronic document distribution.|$|R
