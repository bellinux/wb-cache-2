25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including <b>integrated</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

The aim {{of the work is}} to create the construction principles, theory bases and methods for designing of EHF <b>integrated</b> <b>devices</b> on base of the leaky waveguides. The new approach to the modelling of integrated circuits has been proposed; this approach has been based on the transfer to the two-dimensional problems with non-local boundary conditions. The element base of leaky integrated circuits and methods of device design on its base have been developed, the <b>integrated</b> <b>devices</b> of EHF range have been realized. The leaky <b>integrated</b> <b>devices</b> have been introduced into the short detection and ranging and computer-aided process.

30|$|The {{realization}} of RF measurement on the processed (annealed) lumped-element QD-EAM confirms {{the prospect of}} QD epiwafer in monolithic integration for future references. By applying low-cost intermixing, such integration will have low insertion loss and polarization-independent properties [14]. This is because the <b>integrated</b> <b>devices</b> would actually be made from the same epilayers unlike other types of integration. Therefore, the EAMs would naturally be tuned to the same polarization {{as that of the}} emitted radiation from the corresponding QD lasers, and improved extinction ratio may even be observed due to the improved absorption strength of the same platform that <b>integrated</b> <b>devices</b> share.|$|R
