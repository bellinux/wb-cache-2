5000|$|This is a <b>free</b> <b>quotation</b> from Zechariah 11:12-13. However, Matthew {{attributes}} the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew {{may have been}} mistaken. There are two other possible reasons for the reference. First, Jeremiah also speaks of buying a field, in Jeremiah 32:6-15. That field {{is a symbol of}} hope, not despair as mentioned in Matthew, and the price is 17 pieces of silver. The author of Matthew could have combined the words of Zechariah and Jeremiah, while only citing the [...] "major" [...] prophet. Secondly, [...] "Jeremiah" [...] was sometimes used to refer to the Books of the Prophets in toto as [...] "The Law" [...] is sometimes used to refer to Moses' five books [...] - [...] Genesis through Deuteronomy, the Pentateuch.|$|E
5000|$|Meyer {{explains}} that [...] "there is no exactly corresponding passage, indeed, in Scripture; {{it is simply}} a <b>free</b> <b>quotation</b> harmonizing in thought with parts of various passages, especially , [...] and [...] ". The gospel itself notes, explaining the figurative expressions of Christ, that Jesus was speaking of the Holy Spirit, whom those believing in him would receive (later): [...] "the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified" [...] (John 7:39). Literally, the text states [...] "the (Holy) Spirit was not yet", but this [...] "strange and startling statement" [...] is best read as [...] "the Holy Ghost (Spirit) was not yet given; the word [...] "given" [...] is not in the original text; but is very properly supplied, {{as it is in the}} Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Persic versions. The Arabic version renders it, [...] "for the Holy Ghost was not yet come".|$|E
50|$|The general {{impression}} of luxury and monumentality {{of the interior}} is reinforced by an ensemble of decorative wall painting, {{one of the best}} preserved and most prestigious created in the early 20th century. It followed European trends of the time and was conceived as fully subordinate to architecture. This type of decorative painting is understandably devoid of the painter’s personal touch and probably follows a pattern of central-European origin. The painted decoration of the part of the building constructed in 1925 shows the same pattern, iconography and style as the older part. Its iconography displays a compilation of motifs based on <b>free</b> <b>quotation</b> from various mythologies and artistic traditions. The symbolism of the decoration, through the motifs of cornucopias, sphinxes, gryphons and, the central one, Mercury, clearly refers to the function of the building, conveying the idea of success, affluence and prosperity. To be singled out in terms of artistic merit is the allegorical bust of Serbia, a work of the sculptor Djordje Jovanović originally intended for the monument to the heroes of the Battle of Kosovo in Kruševac. Set up in the vestibule of the older part of the building, the bust underscores the national character of the establishment. Until the Second World War the interior was adorned with the portraits of all previous governors of the National Bank, oils on canvass painted by Uroš Predić.|$|E

500|$|The cantata text is {{the usual}} {{combination}} of Bible <b>quotation,</b> <b>free</b> contemporary poetry and as closing chorale a stanza from a hymn as an affirmation. An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for movement 1, and wrote a sequence of aria, recitative and aria for the following movements. His poetic text places the Christian in general, including the listener at Bach's time or any time, in {{the situation of the}} disciples: he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering, although he does not comprehend. The poetry ends on a prayer for [...] "denial of the flesh". The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger's [...] "", intensifying the prayer, on a melody from the Lochamer-Liederbuch.|$|R
40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis {{deals with}} the copyright issues related to practice of TV companies emphasizing the specific area of TV news and journalism. It presents a basic survey of methods applied by TV stations to ensure {{the requirements of the}} copyright law for a copyright protection of the works which are supposed to be used. A difference is made between the use {{on the basis of a}} contract, above others through a standard license contract or a contract for work, and a non- contractual use on base of a <b>free</b> licence and <b>quotations</b> used most frequently in the sphere of reporting and journalism. Even the regime of collective management of copyrights is described, considering in particular audiovisual works and their individual components. In the context of the private law recodification with its foreseen effectivity from 1 January 2014 this thesis is also pursuing both direct and indirect impacts of the new civil code in the field of copyright. On a theoretical level, it deals with issues which should be resolved in connection with this significant legislative change...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to demonstrate the}} uniqueness of the work of Gilberto Mendes (b. 1922) in the panorama of twentieth-century Brazilian music, through an examination of selected piano pieces. Even though Mendes is mainly known through his choral works, pieces specifically meant for the piano appear throughout his career, allowing the tracing of his evolution as a composer as well as to detect common characteristics that define his style. The list of works chosen includes two Preludios (1945, 1949), four pieces from Pequeno Album para Criancas (1947 - 1951), Sonatina Mozartiana (1951), two Pecas para Piano (1957 - 1958), Musica para Pianono 1 (1962), Blirium C- 9 (1965), Vento Noroeste (1982), Il neige [...] . de nouveau! (1985), Um Estudo? Eisler e Webern Caminham nos Mares do Sul [...] . (1989), and estudo extudo eis tudo pois (1997). Even though the time span of these works allowed for a fascinating development of Mendes' style towards maturity, the pieces chosen for this study share many common traits such as pervasive use of musical <b>quotation,</b> <b>free</b> manipulation of form, and use of intensive repetition. The freedom and flexibility utilized by the composer when combining these elements make him a unique figure among Brazilian contemporary composers...|$|R
40|$|We will {{integrate}} {{in a single}} optimization problem a risk measure beyond the variance and either arbitrage <b>free</b> real market <b>quotations</b> or financial pricing rules generated by an arbitrage free stochastic pricing model. A sequence of investment strategies such that the couple (risk; price) diverges to (-∞, -∞) will be called good deal. We will see that good deals often exist in practice, and the paper main objective will be to measure the good deal size. The provided good deal measures will equal an optimal ratio between both risk and price, and there will exist alternative interpretations of these measures. They will also provide the minimum relative (per dollar) price modification that prevents the good deal existence. Moreover, they will be a crucial instrument to detect those securities or marketed claims which are over or under-priced. Many classical actuarial and financial optimization problems may generate wrong solutions if the used market quotations or stochastic pricing models do not prevent the good deal existence. This fact will be illustrated in the paper, {{and it will be}} pointed out how the provided good deal measurement may be useful to overcome this caveat. Numerical experiments will be yielded as well.

40|$|We {{integrate}} into {{a single}} optimization problem a risk measure, beyond the variance, and either arbitrage <b>free</b> real market <b>quotations</b> or …financial pricing rules generated by an arbitrage free stochastic pricing model. A sequence of investment strategies such that the couple (expected-return, risk) diverges to (+∞, -∞) will be called a good deal. The existence of such a sequence {{is equivalent to the}} existence of an alternative sequence of strategies such that the couple (risk, price) diverges to (-∞, -∞). Moreover, by appropriately adding the riskless asset, every good deal may generate a new one only composed of strategies priced at one. We will see that good deals often exist in practice, and the main objective of this paper will be to measure the good deal size. The provided good deal indices will equal an optimal ratio between both risk and price, and there will exist alternative interpretations of these indices. They also provide the minimum relative (per dollar) price modification that prevents the existence of good deals.
