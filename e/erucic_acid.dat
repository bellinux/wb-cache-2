40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty acid (FA) levels and the severity of symptoms of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Subjects {{of the present study}} consisted of 80 neuroleptic-naïve UHR patients. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between baseline erythrocyte membrane FA levels, measured by gas chromatography, and scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after controlling for age, sex, smoking and cannabis use. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the predominance of positive or negative symptoms based on PANSS subscale scores; membrane FA levels in the three groups were then compared. More severe negative symptoms measured by PANSS were negatively correlated with two saturated FAs (myristic and margaric acids), one ω- 9 monounsaturated FA (MUFA; nervonic acid), and one ω- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; docosapentaenoic acid), and were positively correlated with two ω- 9 MUFAs (eicosenoic and <b>erucic</b> <b>acids)</b> and two ω- 6 PUFAs (γ-linolenic and docosadienoic acids).

Primary manifestations occur in the CNS, the adrenal cortex and the testes' Leydig cells. The clinical presentation shows a marked variability which is not explained by the different X-ALD genotypes. Phenotypes range from rapidly progressive cerebral disease with childhood (childhood cerebral ALD [CCALD]) or adulthood (adult cerebral ALD [ACALD]) onset leading to death within a few years, over adult-onset adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) with or without focal CNS demyelination, AMN converting into a rapidly progressive, cerebral demyelinating phenotype resembling CCALD, to slow disease progression over decades, or adrenal insufficiency only. Approximately 50 % of female heterozygotes develop moderate spastic paresis resembling the AMN phenotype. This review focuses on current experiences with different therapeutic approaches.

40|$|Acyl-acyl {{carrier protein}} (ACP) thioesterases are enzymes {{that control the}} {{termination}} of intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis by hydrolyzing the acyl-ACP complexes. Among the different thioesterase gene families found in plants, the FatA-type fulfills {{a fundamental role in}} the export of the C 18 fatty acid moieties that will be used to synthesize most plant glycerolipids. A reverse genomic approach has been used to study the FatA thioesterase in seed oil accumulation by screening different mutant collections of Arabidopsis thaliana for FatA knockouts. Two mutants were identified with T-DNA insertions in the promoter region of each of the two copies of FatA present in the Arabidopsis genome, from which a double FatA Arabidopsis mutant was made. The expression of both forms of FatA thioesterases was reduced in this double mutant (fata 1 fata 2), as was FatA activity. This decrease did not cause any evident morphological changes in the mutant plants, although the partial reduction of this activity affected the oil content and fatty acid composition of the Arabidopsis seeds. Thus, dry mutant seeds had less triacylglycerol content, while other neutral lipids like diacylglycerols were not affected. Furthermore, the metabolic flow of the different glycerolipid species into seed oil in the developing seeds was reduced at different stages of seed formation in the fata 1 fata 2 line. This diminished metabolic flow induced increases in the proportion of linolenic and <b>erucic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> in the seed oil, in a similar way as previously reported for the wri 1 Arabidopsis mutant that accumulates oil poorly.

The distribution of major QTLs for fatty acids showed a relationship with the fatty acid types: linkage group A 03 for monounsaturated fatty acids, A 04 for saturated fatty acids, and A 05 for polyunsaturated fatty acids. Using a genetical genomics approach, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) hotspots were found at major fatty acid QTLs on linkage groups A 03, A 04, A 05, and A 09. An eQTL-guided gene coexpression network of lipid metabolism-related genes showed major hubs at the genes BrPLA 2 -ALPHA, BrWD- 40, a number of seed storage protein genes, and the transcription factor BrMD- 2, suggesting essential roles for these genes in lipid metabolism.

2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel.
