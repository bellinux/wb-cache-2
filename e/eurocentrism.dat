5|$|Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was {{involved}} in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to {{the election of the}} First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised <b>Eurocentrism</b> and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s.|$|E

He oversaw the opening of the Ghana Museum on 5 March 1957; the Arts Council of Ghana, a wing of the Ministry of Education and Culture, in 1958; the Research Library on African Affairs in June, 1961; and the Ghana Film Corporation in 1964.

2500|$|Kasravi's [...] "views {{threatened}} both modernist {{intellectuals and}} the traditionalist cleric class", {{not only because}} of his vision of religion (apart from Shi'a faith and Sufism, he was also sceptical of Bahaism), but also due to his critical stance on secularism {{and the fact that he}} was [...] "the first Iranian to criticize modernism and <b>Eurocentrism</b> before Al-e Ahmad coined the term “Weststruckness” and made it a genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics contend}} that some Afrocentric {{historical}} research {{is grounded in}} identity politics and myth rather than scholarship. In The Skeptic's Dictionary, philosophy professor Robert Todd Carroll labeled Afrocentrism [...] "pseudohistorical". He argued that Afrocentrism's prime goal was to encourage black nationalism and ethnic pride in order to effectively combat the destructive consequences of cultural and universal racism. Similarly, African-American professor Clarence E. Walker who teaches history at the University of California, Davis, has described Afrocentrism as [...] "a mythology that is racist, reactionary, essentially therapeutic and is <b>eurocentrism</b> in black face." ...|$|E
2500|$|Environmental {{determinism}} (also {{known as}} climatic determinism or geographical determinism) {{is the study}} of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories. Nineteenth century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and eugenics. Many scholars underscore that this approach supported colonialism and <b>eurocentrism,</b> and devalued human agency in non-Western societies. Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth century. This [...] "neo-environmental determinism" [...] school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions.|$|E
2500|$|Francis {{asserted}} that [...] "Almost all non-European contributors to American history either {{have been made}} by individuals and groups that have assimilated Euro-American ideas, values, and goals, or have been conceived, organized, and directed by white leaders.

[...] Francis also called for [...] "white racial consciousness," [...] equating it with <b>Eurocentrism,</b> the [...] "supremacy of white European culture." [...] He called for a society in which [...] "Whites would simply no longer countenance nonwhite aggression and insults or the idolization of nonwhite heroes, icons, and culture; white children would be raised in accordance with what is proper to being white, and norms openly recognized as appropriate to whites would be the legitimizing and dominant norms of American society as they were prior to the 1960s.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of Latin American development, the term [...] "Latin American structuralism" [...] refers to the era of import {{substitution}} industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s until the 1980s. The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized {{in the works of}} Raúl Prebisch, Hans Singer, Celso Furtado, and other structural economic thinkers, and gained prominence with the creation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC or CEPAL). While the theorists behind ISI or Latin American structuralism were not homogeneous and did not belong to one particular school of economic thought, ISI and Latin American structuralism and the theorists who developed its economic framework shared a basic common belief in a state-directed, centrally planned form of economic development. In promoting state-induced industrialization through governmental spending through the infant industry argument, ISI and Latin American structuralist approaches to development are largely influenced by a wide range of Keynesian, communitarian, and socialist economic thought. ISI is often associated and linked with dependency theory, although the latter has traditionally adopted a much broader Marxist sociological framework in addressing what are perceived to be the origins of underdevelopment through the historical effects of colonialism, <b>Eurocentrism,</b> and neoliberalism.|$|E

5000|$|In treatises on {{historical}} or contemporary <b>Eurocentrism</b> that appeared since the 1990s, <b>Eurocentrism</b> is mostly cast {{in terms of}} dualisms such as civilized/barbaric or advanced/backward, developed/undeveloped, core/periphery, implying [...] "evolutionary schemas through which societies inevitably progress", with a remnant of an [...] "underlying presumption of a superior white Western self as referent of analysis" [...] (640). <b>Eurocentrism</b> and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-European countries, cultures and persons have often been criticized in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s, particularly in the greater context of political correctness, race in the United States and affirmative action.In the 1990s, there was a trend of [...] "criticizing" [...] various geographic terms current in the English language as [...] "Eurocentric", such as the traditional division of Eurasia into Europe and Asia or the term [...] "Middle East".Eric Sheppard, in 2005, argued that contemporary Marxism itself has [...] "Eurocentric traits" [...] (in spite of [...] "Eurocentrims" [...] originating in the vocabulary of Marxian economics), because it supposes that the third world must go through a stage of capitalism before [...] "progressive social formations can be envisioned".|$|E
