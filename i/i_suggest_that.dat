25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies {{in accordance with the}} opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{received a}} generally mixed response. Nelson Shin, {{the founder of}} AKOM, the Korean company that animates The Simpsons, {{said that he and}} his staff did protest being asked to animate the sequence. Shin said that the sequence suggests that animators work in sweatshops, but they actually work in [...] "high-tech workshops". He added, [...] "Most of the content was about degrading people from Korea, China, Mexico and Vietnam. If Banksy wants to criticize these things ... <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he learn more about it first." ...|$|E

500|$|Heidemann and Walde {{produced}} a prospectus for internal discussion, outlining what {{was available for}} purchase and the costs. The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: [...] "If our company thinks that the risk is too great, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights." [...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted {{a little over two}} hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.|$|E
500|$|The first {{shipping}} line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, {{better known as}} the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder, the Canadian Samuel Cunard. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when [...] left Liverpool for Boston, via Halifax, Nova Scotia. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary. [...] Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a US steamship line: [...] "America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy... <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard". In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract. The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{then called}} for Stevenson {{to give a}} full {{accounting}} of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E

2500|$|S. N. Hagen stated [...] "The Kensington {{alphabet}} is {{a synthesis}} of older unsimplified runes, later dotted runes, {{and a number of}} Latin letters ... The runes for a, n, s and t are the old Danish unsimplified forms which should have been out of use for a long time ...<b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> [...] creator must at some time or other in his life have been familiar with an inscription (or inscriptions) composed at a time when these unsimplified forms were still in use" [...] and that he [...] "was not a professional runic scribe before he left his homeland".|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao then wrote a {{memorial}} to Emperor Xian: [...] "Army Libationer Guo Jia {{had served in the}} military for 11 years. There would be a discussion whenever we faced difficult situations, and when I could not decide on what to do, {{he was the one who}} helped me arrive at my decisions. He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. It is unfortunate that he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households." [...] The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao to Emperor Xian, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Zhen" [...] (貞侯), which literally means [...] "chaste marquis".|$|E
2500|$|The {{guests at}} the hotel {{typically}} are comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, as for example in the episode [...] "Communication Problems", revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. By the end, Basil faints just {{at the mention of}} her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.") and to the guests ("May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").|$|E

2500|$|In 258, Sun Chen deposed {{the second}} Wu emperor Sun Liang and {{replaced}} the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, [...] "Ding Feng {{may not be}} proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions." [...] Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng for a meeting and said to the latter, [...] "Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want {{you to help me}} eliminate him." [...] Ding Feng replied, [...] "The Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court is on our side. We cannot confront them directly. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival." [...] Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen stepped inside, Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him. For his contributions, Ding Feng was promoted to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍) and received the additional appointments of Left and Right Protectors of the Capital (左右都護).|$|E
