The composition of Thy-1 carbohydrate moieties varies considerably between different tissues or even among cells of the same lineage at different stages of differentiation: e.g., <b>galactosamine</b> only in brain Thy-1, sialic acid in thymic Thy-1 in far excess than brain Thy-1, that too increasing in parallel with T cell maturation.

2500|$|The slime glands {{themselves}} are {{deep inside the}} body cavity, each {{at the end of}} a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. The slime, which can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight, is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins â€” primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly <b>galactosamine.</b> The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant nonylphenol. Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes [...] "slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent". The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime's high tensile strength and stretchiness. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which is appropriate, because it takes an onychophoran about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes. They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with his}} {{students}} and collaborators, {{over the next}} 20 years, McCarty's work changed {{the understanding of the}} organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by electronmicroscopy. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A-specific polysaccharide and the peptidoglycan, and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal hexosamine. In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved hexosamine (a hexosaminidase) from a soil organism. Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the hexosamine linkage by synthesizing both Î±- and Î²-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal Î²-N-acetyl <b>galactosamine</b> as the serological determinant.|$|E

The amino-terminal threonine residue is blocked by an O-linked <b>galactosamine</b> oligosaccharide, and the protein has five glucosamine oligosaccharides N-linked to the acceptor sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr. The 18 tryptophan residues are arranged in four clusters, and 12 of the tryptophans are conserved in homologous positions. Computer-assisted analysis of the internal homology in amino acid sequence suggested duplication of an ancestral gene thus indicating that hemopexin consists of two similar halves.Altruda et al.

The demonstration shows direct correspondence between exons and the 10 repeating units in the protein. As the introns were not placed randomly; they fell {{in the center of}} the region of amino acid sequence homology in strikingly similar locations in 6 of the 10 units and in a symmetric position in each half of the coding sequence.

50|$|Considering {{the animal}} source of {{pharmaceutical}} heparin, {{the numbers of}} potential impurities are relatively large compared with a wholly synthetic therapeutic agent. The range of possible biological contaminants includes viruses, bacterial endotoxins, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents, lipids, proteins, and DNA. During the preparation of pharmaceutical-grade heparin from animal tissues, impurities such as solvents, heavy metals, and extraneous cations can be introduced. However, the methods employed to minimize the occurrence and to identify and/or eliminate these contaminants are well established and listed in guidelines and pharmacopoeias. The major challenge {{in the analysis of}} heparin impurities is the detection and identification of structurally related impurities. The most prevalent impurity in heparin is dermatan sulfate (DS), also known as chondroitin sulfate B. The building-block of DS is a disaccharide composed of 1,3-linked N-acetyl <b>galactosamine</b> (GalN) and a uronic acid residue, connected via 1,4 linkages to form the polymer. DS is composed of three possible uronic acid (GlcA, IdoA or IdoA2S) and four possible hexosamine (GalNAc, Gal- NAc4S, GalNAc6S, or GalNAc4S6S) building-blocks. The presence of iduronic acid in DS distinguishes it from chrondroitin sulfate A and C and likens it to heparin and HS. DS has a lower negative charge density overall compared to heparin. A common natural contaminant, DSis present at levels of 1-7% in heparin API, but has no proven biological activity that influences the anticoagulation effect of heparin.|$|E
5000|$|The Onychophora forcefully squirt glue-like slime {{from their}} oral papillae; {{they do so}} either in defense against predators or to capture prey.

Inside, they have a syringe-like system that, by a geometric amplifier, allows for fast squirt using slow muscular contraction. High speed films show the animal expelling two streams of adhesive liquid through a small opening (50 to 200 microns) at a speed of 3 to 5 m/s. The interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow produces a passive oscillatory motion (30-60 Hz) of the oral papillae.

In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden bei der Galaktosamin-Hepatitis biochemische und morphologische VerÃ¤nderungen beschrieben, die durch die Verabreichung von Triton WR- 1339 beziehungsweise Prednisolon hervorgerufen werden. â€” Durch Bestimmung der sauren Phosphatase, N-Acetyl-ÃŸ-glucosaminidase, Kathepsin D und sauren Carboxypeptidase in Lysosomenfraktionen konnte sowohl durc...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{turnover}} of 1251 -labelled fibrinogen and 131 I-labelled albumin was {{studied in the}} course of galactosamine-induced hepatitis in rabbits. In addition to <b>galactosamine,</b> some animals were treated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) to inhibit the activation of the fibrinolytic system. The infusion of <b>galactosamine</b> and EACA caused generation of fibrin-rich microclots in the renal glomerular capillaries in seven out of 12 rabbits. Correspondingly, the incorporation of 125 I-radioactivity into liver, spleen, and kidneys was pronounced in galactosamine- and EACA-treated rabbits compared with control animals treated with EACA. An acceleration of the 1251 -fibrinogen elimination from the plasma was observed between eight and 12 hours after the start of the <b>galactosamine</b> infusion. The administration of heparin in addition to <b>galactosamine</b> and EACA prevented the occurrence of intravascular coagulation, but shortened the survival times of the animals because of bleeding into visceral organs. The elimination of 131 I-albumin in plasma as well as the distribution of 131 I-radioactivity in organs were similar in all the rabbits independent of the treatment with <b>galactosamine,</b> EACA, or heparin. The experiments indicate that, in addition to diminished synthesis of coagulation factors, disseminated intravascular coagulation is involved in galactosamine-induced hepatitis and contributes to the haemostatic disorder. Severe liver disease may be complicated by coagula-tion abnormalities. It is not yet established whether diminished synthesis or enhanced consumption of coagulation factors caused by disseminated intra-vascular coagulation (DIC) is responsible for the haemostatic disorder in liver failure (Bloom, 1975). Studies in man indicate that DIC may be involved in the pathogenesis of liver disease (Verstraete et al. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{glucosamine}} and <b>galactosamine</b> were determined in conidia, germinating conidia, and vegetative mycelia of Neurospora crassa. In the vegetative mycelia about 90 % of the amino sugars {{were shown to}} be components of the cell wall. The remaining 10 % of the amino sugars were tentatively identified as the nucleotide sugars uridine diphospho- 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose and uridine diphospho- 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-galactose. Conidia and vegetative mycelia contained about the same levels of glucosamine. During the first 9 h after the initiation of germination, the total glucosamine content had increased 3. 1 -fold, whereas the residual dry weight of the culture had increased 7. 7 -fold. This led to {{a drop in the}} glucosamine concentration from 100 mumol/g of residual dry weight to 42 mumol/g. During this time, all of the conidia had germinated and the surface area of the new germ tubes had increased to 10 times that of the conidia. Either germ tubes were initially produced without glucosamine-containing polymers, or these polymers (probably chitin) were deposited only at low densities in the germ tube cell walls. The chitin precursor uridine diphospho- 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose was present at all times during conidial germination. Conida contained very low levels of <b>galactosamine.</b> During germination, <b>galactosamine</b> could not be detected until the culture had reached a cell density of about 0. 6 mg of residual dry weight per ml of growth medium. This was observed regardless of the time required to reach this cell density or the fold increase in dry weight. The accumulation of galactosamine-containing polymers {{does not appear to be}} necessary for germ tube formation. The levels of soluble <b>galactosamine</b> (uridine diphospho- 2 -actamido- 2 -deoxy-D-galatose) were very low in conidia and increased during germination at the same time that <b>galactosamine</b> appeared in the cellular polymers. In addition, under certain culture conditions, the appearance of <b>galactosamine</b> and the increase in the glucosamine concentration occurred simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The endothelin {{system has}} been implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of acute liver failure. However, {{it has not yet}} been assessed in a tissue specific manner. Acute liver failure was induced in rats by two in-traperitoneal injections of <b>galactosamine</b> (1. 3 g/kg, in-terval of 12 hours, n = 20). The animals were sacri-ficed after 48 hours. Plasma measurements demonstrated that animals receiving <b>galactosamine</b> had a laboratory constellation of severe liver injury and they histologically presented with hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Plasma con-centrations of endothelin- 1 were elevated 60 -fold in the animals receiving <b>galactosamine</b> (p = 0. 005). In contrast endothelin- 1 tissue contents were decreased in the kidneys and unchanged in the liver. Western blot analysis showed that animals receiving <b>galactosamine</b> had a significantly lower endothelin B receptor con-centration in liver and kidney tissue, whereas no differ-ences were detected for endothelin A receptors. This study demonstrates that the local endothelin system of liver and kidneys is not responsible for the increase of plasma endothelin- 1 concentrations in acute liver failure. Since it is well established that the endothelin B receptor acts as a clearance receptor, its decreased density might contribute to the strongly ele-vated plasma endothelin- 1 concentrations seen in this model of acute liver injury.

40|$|Cell wall lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{prepared}} from oxidase-positive Moraxella duplex {{and from}} oxidase-negative Micrococcus calco-aceticus (a presumptive moraxella) contained D-glucose, D-galactose, glucosamine, <b>galactosamine,</b> lipid A, ethanolamine, fatty acids, phosphate, and protein. The lipid A moieties prepared from the LPS fractions were composed primarily of hexosamines, ethanolamine, fatty acids, and phosphate with minor {{amounts of the}} other LPS constituents. The LPS from M. duplex and M. calco-aceticus had the same neutral sugar composition but differed markedly in their hexosamine composition. <b>Galactosamine</b> was the major hexosamine component of M. duplex; also present was an unidentified amino sugar and {{a small amount of}} mannosamine. In contrast, glucosamine was the major hexosamine component of M. calco-aceticus with a lesser amount of <b>galactosamine</b> and no mannosamine. The presence of <b>galactosamine</b> as the major component of the lipid A of M. duplex suggests that this fraction has a novel structure which differs from the poly-D-glucosamine 'backbone' structure assigned to lipid A. The fatty acid compositions of the lipid A from the two species were mutually similar and consisted mainly of hydroxylauric, hydroxymyristic, and C 17 -cyclopropane fatty acids. The LPS fractions of the two organisms studied resemble that of Neisseria catarrhalis and differ from those of the true neisserias. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|D-galactosamine (100 mg) {{was added}} to the reconstituted blood during 4 h {{perfusion}} of livers isolated either from control rats or those injected with turpentine 20 h or 5 h earlier. This dose of <b>galactosamine</b> administered 30 min before [3 H]lysine significantly inhibited the incorporation of the label into liver proteins, and even more into plasma proteins, but albumin and acute-phase reactants (fibrinogen, seromucoid fraction, Concanavalin A-adsorbed glycoproteins) were all similarly affected. When <b>galactosamine</b> was administered in vivo simultaneously with turpentine, and the liver was isolated 5 h later, trauma-induced fibrinogen synthesis was selectively inhibited. This can be explained either by a differential control of synthesis of various acute-phase reactants, or by augmentation of catabolism of fibrinogen in galactosamine-treated rats. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of the full perfusate or Concanavalin A-adsorbed glycoproteins did not reveal any significant effect of <b>galactosamine</b> on the protein pattern obtained from control or turpentine-stimulated liver donors...|$|E
