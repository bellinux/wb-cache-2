5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E

5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} feeds {{primarily on}} molluscs, followed by crustaceans and bony fishes. A predator of both this shark and its egg cases is the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). A known parasite {{of this species}} is the myxosporidian Chloromyxum scyliorhinum. Reproduction is oviparous; adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts. As a prelude to mating, the male bites at the female's pectoral fin, side, and gill region. Once he has a grip, he wraps his body around <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation may last between 15 seconds and 4 minutes. The claspers of the male are unusual in that each has a row of around a hundred hooks running along the inner margin. These hooks likely serve to anchor the male to the female during copulation. The female is capable of storing sperm within her nidamental gland (an organ that secretes egg cases) for many months.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple {{have a hard time}} getting any sleep. Pete has to cope with {{the death of his father}} in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{has said}} one of her biggest {{developments}} in college was to build her strength up. Despite pulling down 7.3 rebounds per game, she counted rebounding as a weakness of <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> would continue to work hard on it to improve.|$|E

25|$|Barnett visited Kelly for {{the last}} time between 7:00 and 8:00p.m. on 8 November.

25|$|In 1975, in {{preparation}} for the American Bicentennial, the City ordered the remains moved to the courtyard of the Betsy Ross House. However, cemetery workers found no remains beneath her tombstone.

25|$|The {{ambivalent}} {{attitude to}} Messalina {{can be seen}} in the late mediaeval French prose work in the J. Paul Getty Museum illustrated by the Master of Boucicaut, Tiberius, Messalina, and Caligula reproach one another in the midst of flames. It recounts a dialogue that takes place in hell between the three characters from the same imperial line. Messalina wins the debate by demonstrating that their sins were far worse than <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> suggests that they repent of their own wickedness before reproaching her as they had done.|$|E
60|$|He {{pointed to}} a pub up a side street, and went in with Kumbo holding on to his arm. The barman was for sending us out at fust, but such a crowd follered us in that he altered 'is mind.

25|$|In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her {{start in}} music when she founded {{and was the}} lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be {{confused}} with the English band Placebo). She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring the Ramones. At this concert she met Brendan Canning, whose band hHead performed immediately before <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> with whom she joined in Broken Social Scene ten years later.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{the living}} {{collections}} include 14,980 individual plants (including nursery holdings) belonging to 10,117 accessions representing 3,924 taxa; with {{particular emphasis on}} the ligneous species of North America and eastern Asia. Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by Charles Sprague Sargent, Ernest Henry Wilson, William Purdom, Joseph <b>Hers,</b> <b>and</b> Joseph Rock. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to Japan and Korea, the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western Hubei Province, and more recent expeditions to China and Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Days later, Mulder {{repeated}} her allegations, {{this time}} to a weekly magazine in an interview conducted in her Paris apartment. Within hours of the interview, her sister Saskia arrived and took her to Villa Montsouris, a psychiatric hospital specializing in such disorders as depression, anxiety, and delirium, where she stayed for five months. The stay reportedly was paid for by Elite models president Gérald Marie, {{an old friend of}} <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> one of the accused.

25|$|In October 2009, workmen {{clearing}} vegetation {{from the}} bottom of the M5 at Junction 14 discovered human bones in a black bin bag dumped in the bushes at the side of the motorway. The police were called soon after, and it was soon established that the bones were those of a young female. A few days later, DNA found on the remains confirmed that the body was that of Melanie Hall, who disappeared in June 1996 after a night out in Bath, Somerset, and who had been declared dead in absentia in 2004. Dental records confirmed that the body was <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> the police began a formal investigation into her murder. As of 2016 no one has been prosecuted in connection with this case.|$|E
25|$|According to the OFAC, this {{sanction}} {{was part}} of a joint effort with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles to work with the Mexican government. The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally with drug money invested in the economy. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a wire tap phone conversation Abigael had with Diana María Sánchez Carlón, one of his financial assistants. In that conversation, Abigael asked her how his hotel was doing, prompting the U.S. government to investigate what he was referring to exactly. Sánchez Carlón was introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho Cázares, a close friend of <b>hers</b> <b>and</b> wife of Abigael. Both Sánchez Carlón and Camacho Cázares were sanctioned through the Kingpin Act for their alleged role in money laundering.|$|E
25|$|The family {{house of}} Suzu & Shūsaku {{is located on}} a {{hillside}} {{in the suburbs of}} Kure, {{with a view of the}} Japanese Naval Fleet in the harbor, including the largest battleships, Yamato and Musashi. Suzu enjoys touching nature and viewing warships moving on the sea with her niece, Harumi. One day, as Suzu draws pictures of floating warships, the military police accost her and come close to accusing her of espionage. In December 1944, a navy sailor named Tetsu comes to visit Suzu: he was a childhood friend of <b>hers,</b> <b>and</b> he has been assigned to the Japanese cruiser Aoba, which is stationed in Kure. Understanding it might be Suzu's last chance to see Tetsu alive, Shūsaku leaves them alone to talk without a chaperone. The next spring, Shūsaku is drafted by the Navy and temporarily quartered with troops in Otake City, 40 miles away from Kure.|$|E
