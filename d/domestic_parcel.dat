50|$|Taft {{proposed}} that the Post Office Department act as a bank that would accept small deposits. Though the idea was opposed by conservative Republicans such as Senator Aldrich and Speaker of the House Joseph Cannon, Taft won passage of a law establishing the United States Postal Savings System. Taft also oversaw {{the establishment of a}} <b>domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> post delivery system.|$|E
50|$|The British <b>domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> {{post service}} was {{established}} on 1 August 1883. Commonwealth and foreign parcel post services were also established. The eight Australasian colonies (South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, New Zealand, British New Guinea and Fiji) {{and the other}} separate postal services of the colonies joined the UPU in 1891. By 1909/10, over 118 million parcels annually were being carried in the U.K., around 2.5% of which were international.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outskirts}} of Orari consists of mainly 2-8 hectare [...] "lifestyle blocks", <b>domestic</b> land <b>parcels</b> where families graze farm animals including horses, sheep, and cattle. Surrounding {{the town is}} pastoral farmland including sheep raised for wool and meat, small scale horse breeding, and large scale dairy farming, orchards supporting fruit and nut production, and small support businesses supporting bee wax refining, irrigation, and agricultural and farming activities.|$|R
40|$|Both culture-based and culture-independent, biomarker-targeted {{microbial}} enumeration {{and identification}} technologies {{were employed to}} estimate total microbial and viral burden and diversity within the cabin air of commercial airliners. Samples from each of twenty flights spanning three commercial carriers were collected via air-impingement. When the total viable microbial population was estimated by assaying relative concentrations of the universal energy carrier ATP, values ranged from below detection limits (BDL) to 4. 1 x 106 cells/cubic m of air. The total viable microbial population was extremely low in both of Airline A (approximately 10 % samples) and C (approximately 18 % samples) compared to the samples collected aboard flights on Airline A and B (approximately 70 % samples). When samples were collected {{as a function of}} time over the course of flights, a gradual accumulation of microbes was observed from the time of passenger boarding through mid-flight, followed by a sharp decline in microbial abundance and viability from the initiation of descent through landing. It is concluded in this study that only 10 % of the viable microbes of the cabin air were cultivable and suggested a need to employ state-of-the art molecular assay that measures both cultivable and viable-but-non-cultivable microbes. Among the cultivable bacteria, colonies of Acinetobacter sp. were by far the most profuse in Phase I, and Gram-positive bacteria of the genera Staphylococcus and Bacillus were the most abundant during Phase II. The isolation of the human pathogens Acinetobacter johnsonii, A. calcoaceticus, Janibacter melonis, Microbacterium trichotecenolyticum, Massilia timonae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium lipophiloflavum is concerning, as these bacteria can cause meningitis, septicemia, and a handful of sometimes fatal diseases and infections. Molecular microbial community analyses exhibited presence of the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta- proteobacteria, as well as Gram-positive bacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deinococci, Bacterioidetes, Spirochetes, and Planctomyces in varying abundance. Neisseria meningitidis rDNA sequences were retrieved in great abundance from Airline A followed by Streptococcus oralis/mitis sequences. Pseudomonas synxantha sequences dominated Airline B clone libraries, followed by those of N. meningitidis and S. oralis/mitis. In Phase II, Airline C, sequences representative of more than 113 species, enveloping 12 classes of bacteria, were retrieved. Proteobacterial sequences were retrieved in greatest frequency (58 % of all clone sequences), followed in short order by those stemming from Gram-positives bacteria (31 % of all clone sequences). As for overall phylogenetic breadth, Gram-positive and alpha-proteobacteria seem to have a higher affinity for international flights, whereas beta-and gamma-proteobacteria are far more common about <b>domestic</b> cabin air <b>parcels</b> in Airline C samples. Ultimately, the majority of microbial species circulating throughout the cabin airs of commercial airliners are commensal, infrequently pathogenic normal flora of the human nasopharynx and respiratory system. Many of these microbes likely originate from the oral and nasal cavities, and lungs of passengers and flight crew and are disseminated unknowingly via routine conversation, coughing, sneezing, and stochastic passing of fomites. The data documented in this study will be useful to generate a baseline microbial population database and can be utilized to develop biosensor instrumentation for monitoring microbial quality of cabin or urban air...|$|R
50|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> {{post service}} was adopted in 1913, 25 {{years after the}} Post Office had agreed to deliver {{international}} parcel post packages pursuant to the Universal Postal Union treaty and various bilateral agreements with other nations. Initially, there were no or few postal regulations governing packages mailed by parcel post. E.g., to construct a bank in Vernal, Utah, in 1916, a Salt Lake City company ascertained that the cheapest way to send 40 tons of bricks to the building was by parcel post.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{a parcel}} post may be {{credited}} to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In {{the first year after}} the establishment of the <b>domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.|$|E
5000|$|USPS <b>Domestic</b> <b>Parcel</b> Post was an {{affordable}} method of sending large parcels {{of up to}} seventy pounds and a maximum combined length and girth of one hundred and thirty inches via ground transportation across the U.S. Effective January 27, 2013, the USPS renamed its parcel post service from 'Parcel Post' to 'Standard Post'. Effective January 17, 2016, the USPS renamed the service again, from [...] "Standard Post" [...] to [...] "USPS Retail Ground", a name intended to resemble those of competing services UPS Ground and FedEx Ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} Rural Free Delivery (RFD) in the U.S. in 1896, and {{the inauguration of}} a <b>domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> post service by Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock in 1913, greatly {{increased}} the volume of mail shipped nationwide, and motivated {{the development of more}} efficient postal transportation systems. Many rural customers took advantage of inexpensive Parcel Post rates to order goods and products from businesses located hundreds of miles away in distant cities for delivery by mail. From the 1910s to the 1960s, many college students and others used parcel post to mail home dirty laundry, as doing so was less expensive than washing the clothes themselves.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} <b>domestic</b> <b>parcel</b> post service (a belated development, given that international parcel post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|E
