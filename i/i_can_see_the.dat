5|$|<b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room!) is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (<b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E

25|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story, Lichtenstein’s <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) depicts a man {{looking through a}} hole in a door. It was sold by {{collector}} Courtney Sale Ross for $43 million, double its estimate, at Christie's in New York City in 2011; the seller's husband, Steve Ross had acquired it at auction in 1988 for $2.1 million. The painting measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E

500|$|During Casino Royale's {{final draft}} stages, Fleming allowed his friend William Plomer {{to see a}} copy, and remarked [...] "so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> element of {{suspense}} is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed {{to cope with the}} demand.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about two female friends being {{concerned}} about their other friend who denies her bad love relationship and tries {{to convince them that}} nothing is wrong. As the girls know what is really happening, they try to comfort her and make her leave the partner. A writer of The Times of India found a break-up theme in the song, further saying that [...] "In 'Girl', the relational mishaps play out as three-way girl talk, with two girlfriends trying to help their sister see the truth of a bad connection". It opens with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "Take a minute girl, come sit down/ And tell us what's been happening/ In your face <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pain/ Don't try and convince us you're happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Okereke read Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre's Critique of Everyday Life, works which analyse {{how people}} {{experience}} leisure in modern societies, and {{was inspired to}} pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis. [...] "The Prayer" [...] is based on drug use during nights out in clubs, while [...] "On" [...] specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, [...] "In a time when so many people feel they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> appeal of cocaine." [...] "Sunday" [...] details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while [...] "SRXT" [...] {{takes the form of}} a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis. The album closer is named after Seroxat, a trade name for the antidepressant paroxetine, and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke's friends after they left university in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E

2500|$|The court debated what [...] "religious worship" [...] meant but {{identified}} the phrase [...] "place of meeting for religious worship" [...] in the 1855 Act {{as being the}} key issue. To Lord Denning's mind, this meant [...] "a place of which the principal use was {{as a place where}} people came together as a congregation to do reverence" [...] to a deity, whether it was the Christian God or some other. The judges agreed that Scientology's practices [...] "did not reveal any form whatever of worship. [...] did not humble themselves in reverence or recognition of the dominant power and control of any entity or being outside their own bodies and life." [...] As Lord Denning put it, [...] "There is considerable stress on the spirit of Man, and adherents of this religion or philosophy believe that a man's spirit is everlasting and moves from one human frame to another. But it is still, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>the</b> spirit of Man and not God." [...] The court found that {{there was no evidence of}} religious worship taking place in the chapel and dismissed the appeal. Permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.|$|E

Meanwhile, Chinese and English voice-over is aired [...] "there are dreams in life after all". [...] The sunbird and the blind singer Yang Haitao (杨海涛) walk onto the center stage in the field together referred to as the [...] "White Jade Plate".

2500|$|Berry {{recalls the}} artistic {{inspiration}} he obtained from... "the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life." [...] Lamenting change, he bemoans that, [...] "the old wooden mangle rollers {{were replaced by}} rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared..." [...] He felt {{he had been born}} into a tightly cohesive society, but [...] "the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded." [...] He loved a world that was filled with, [...] "a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and a smell of gas...youths playing cards {{at the back of the}} old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear." [...] This was a [...] "place of empty chapels and aborted kilns", [...] "the window cleaner with wild eyes and a mania for gambling", or indeed [...] "an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it." [...] Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: [...] "at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink", and when one might feel [...] "as dry as a lime-burner's clog." [...] He loved [...] "the sunken bricks of his garden path." [...] and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: [...] "as I stand piddling in the crazed urinal stall <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world." ...|$|E
