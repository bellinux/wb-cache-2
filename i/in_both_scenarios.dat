The Sole Survivor {{is faced with}} a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, or to inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and trigger a feud between the Harbormen and Acadia.

Alternatively, if the player confronts DiMA over Avery's murder, Acadia may become hostile. The Sole Survivor is able to establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt a more moderate stance towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can choose to make the main factions aware of Acadia's existence. If so, The Institute, a scientific organization that made the synths, will send agents to reclaim the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a quasi-religious organization rooted in the United States Armed Forces, will launch an expedition to exterminate them. The Railroad, a group opposed to the existence of The Institute with the aim of freeing sentient synths, will send an operative to make contact with Acadia, though the latter will reject their help.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{simultaneous}} decision {{of a professional}} sports club on gate ticket prices and talent demand is analysed for a profit and a win maximizing sports club.

Somewhat unexpected is the result that an increase of salary level lowers the optimal ticket price, which complicates the impact of a salary cap on the ticket price. One of the consequences of the identical pricing rule is that all tests based on the pricing rule cannot be conclusive w. r. t. the objective of a club. Also the value of the estimated price elasticity of the demand for tickets can hardly reveal anything about the objective of a sports club. More reliable tests could be based on the comparison of the marginal productivity and the salary level, or on the different impact of revenue sharing. ...|$|R
