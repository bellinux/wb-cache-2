40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{results of}} a major study of the benefits and costs of investment in design in small and medium sized manufacturers. It shows that UK manufacturers which received a government subsidy to employ a professional design consultant for product, engineering, packaging and graphic design projects recovered their total investment in an average of fifteen months, as well as gaining other indirect benefits. However, problems in using and managing the design consultants {{was a factor in}} a quarter of the projects that were not implemented or produced disappointing commercial results. The problems most associated with project failure was inadequate briefing of the consultant and internal disagreements about the aims or value of the projects. Severe design management problems were most common in firms with under fifty employees and especially affected firms with under ten employees. Thus, while small firms often lack <b>in-house</b> <b>specialist</b> skills such as design, such firms require additional help and advice if they are to use external resources effectively...|$|E

40|$|The authors discuss {{basic methods}} of {{statistical}} surveillance {{used to assess}} risks associated with construction investment projects. The methods considered in this article include a sensitivity analysis (based on the assessments of initial parameters of a project and its final characteristics (usually IRR or NPV)), a method of scenarios (based on assessment {{of the risk of}} the project failure considered as the total of all probabilities of a negative NPV), a method of discount rate adjustments (based on the adjustment of the discount rate by adding a risk premium calculated by an expert or an <b>in-house</b> <b>specialist),</b> a decision tree method (whereby a project is reduced to development of a hierarchical scheme of all possible actions; results of an investment project have a treeshaped structure), a Monte Carlo method (meaning a special case of simulation). The authors describe their main advantages, disadvantages and problems that accompany their practical application. The authors also describe methods based on the fuzzy logic theory and suggest formalization of inputs and outputs as a fuzzy interval. General milestones include fuzzification, development of fuzzy rules, de-fuzzification, and methods of de-fuzzification (including a method of maximum centre, a method of maximum value, and a centroid method). The authors make their conclusion in respect of the method that may be regarded as the most suitable for investment projects in the construction industry.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} patent information by innovative SMEs. The standard literature tends to focus on obtaining patents; studies of using patent information for different purposes are underrepresented in the innovation literature. Studying the case of SMEs is especially interesting, because they often do not have <b>in-house</b> <b>specialists</b> dealing with patent issues. Our research reveals {{that the most important}} reasons why SMEs do not use patent information are: (i) costs; (ii) unclear procedures. These constraints may be tackled by improving the communication on the usefulness of patent information, improving access to patent information, and integrating more lessons on using patent and patent information in education. Given that using patent information is useful for SMEs, its use should be promoted. The key players in this respect are NIPO (the Dutch organization responsible for patents and patent information), trade associations, and educational institutions.

40|$|Barter {{trade is}} on the {{increase}} worldwide in both developed and developing countries. This study is aimed at investigating the management practices used by firms involved in barter trading {{in order to ensure}} that they take optimal advantage of benefits of barter trade and minimise its potential problems. Data was collected from 61 barter trade practitioners from the South African media industry. The findings show that most of the firms realise the need to have dedicated personnel responsible for barter trade in their firms. Having dedicated personnel responsible for barter trade helps ensure accountability. The findings also show that most of the firms actively search for barter opportunities, have top management support in their barter trading activities, make use of <b>in-house</b> <b>specialists</b> to negotiate barter deals and have in place clearly defined policies on managing barter trade. Nearly all the policies prescribe products that can be bartered, maximum value of deals acceptable, evaluation criteria for barter deals, accounting and tax treatment of barter deals as well as barter trade authorisation procedures. The findings of the study have practical significance to firms considering using barter trade in their organisations. These have been highlighted in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} for {{the award}} {{of the degree}} of Masters in Business Administration Health Care Management (MBA-HCM) In response to escalating costs of healthcare at Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Medical Services Department, this research investigates the underlying causes that if addressed, will lead to greater cost efficiency. A preliminary examination of archival data and budgetary allocations revealed that referral rates at KPA are disturbingly high and are the main factor accounting for the highest expenditure rates. Over the 10 -year period that records are available, the percentage costs of the four major cost drivers are referrals, 48 %, medicines 24 %, salaries 14. 4 % and allowances 13. 6 %. Armed with these facts, the mixed methods study used archived patient data and survey questionnaires with clinicians at KPA Bandari Clinic to unearth the principal reasons for high referral rates. The study premised that inadequate equipment, lack of <b>in-house</b> <b>specialists,</b> increased health-seeking behaviour, disease patterns and burdens, among others, would explain the high referral rates. Findings confirmed these assumptions, revealing that clinicians’, patients’, and KPA-specific factors are responsible for the high number of referrals and associated escalating costs. The study culminates in the presentation of practical cost-containment suggestions and policy options...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the design, {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} a software tool {{with the purpose of}} assisting in the localisation of root causes of test case failures in distributed embedded systems, specifically vehicle systems controlled by a network of electronic control units (ECUs). Fault localisation is especially hard in such systems due to its distributed nature, and often organisations rely on the knowledge of <b>in-house</b> <b>specialists</b> for detecting and rectifying the underlying root cause of test case failures. The study took place in-situ at the Research and Development division of Volvo Car Corporation, a large automotive manufacturer. Researchers had access to a vast number of test execution logs from large-scale software integration testing under a continuous integration process. The main objectives of the research were to develop and evaluate a data visualisation tool to support root-cause identification of failures in order to foster a continuous feedback loop in the fault localisation process. Our contributions encourage the improvement of testing quality and supporting the development and adoption of test case writing guidelines and test failure debugging procedures. The research concludes that the use of data visualisation techniques can considerably boost the failure debugging procedures by presenting data in a clear and concise manner and making use of test harnesses to directly assist in reducing possible causes of failures. Additionally it encourages a systematic and continuous analysis of the current state of testing by aggregating, categorising and displaying large amounts of historical data in a concise manner that allows stakeholders to identify patterns and trends in test results...|$|R

Since 1969, the 1. 7 million-square-foot Forrestal Building has served as DOE Headquarters. In 1989, a team of <b>in-house</b> energy <b>specialists</b> began searching for opportunities to make the Forrestal Building more energy efficient. The team, on which personnel from the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) served, identified lighting as an area in which energy use could be reduced substantially. A monitoring program showed that the building`s more than 34, 000 1 -foot by 4 -foot fluorescent lighting fixtures were responsible for 33 % of the building`s total annual electric energy use, which represents more than 9 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. In initiating the relighting program, DOE hoped to achieve these broad goals: Reduce energy use and utility bills, and improve lighting quality by distributing the light more uniformly. Funding was also an important consideration. DOE sought financing alternatives through which the lighting retrofit is paid for without using government-appropriated capital funds. DOE cut lighting costs more than 50 % and paid for the project with the money saved on energy bills...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of business firms that gain access to legislative and executive branch officials in the trade policymaking area. Our empirical analysis of over 1200 manufacturers reveals that legislators were most attracted to firms with foreign market expertise, firms which actively participated in politics with outside lobbyists and campaign contributions, and firms with significant employment in the state and/or district. Executive branch officials were responsive to firms with foreign market expertise, firms from industries that had previously received tariff protection, firms using <b>in-house</b> government affairs <b>specialists</b> and outside lobbyists to convey information, and firms making campaign contributions {{to members of the}} trade oversight legislative committees. Our results largely support the political market framework and provide insights about the attractiveness of certain demanders to suppliers of trade policies from the legislative and executive branches of the U.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} an update of a Cochrane systematic review on tobacco use cessation (TUC) in dental settings {{as well as}} narrative reviews of possible approaches to TUC and a more detailed discussion of referral for specialist TUC services. On {{the basis of these}} reviews we conclude that interventions for tobacco users in the dental setting increase the odds of quitting tobacco. However, the evidence is derived largely from patients using smokeless tobacco. Pharmacotherapy (such as nicotine replacements, bupropion and varenicline) is recommended for TUC in medical settings but has received little assessment in dental applications, although such evidence to date is promising. Whether the dental setting or referral to specialist TUC services is the most effective strategy to help people to quit tobacco use is unclear. An effective specialist service providing best available TUC care alone may not be the answer. Clearly, such services should be both accessible and convenient for tobacco users. Closer integration of specialist services with referrers would also be advantageous in order to guide and support oral health professionals make their referral and to maximise follow-up of referred tobacco users. Future research direction may consider investigating the most effective components of TUC in the dental settings and community-based trials should be a priority. Pharmacotherapy, particularly nicotine replacement therapy, should be more widely examined in dental settings. We also recommend that various models of referral to external and competent <b>in-house</b> TUC <b>specialist</b> services should be examined with both experimental and qualitative approaches. In addition to overall success of TUC, important research questions include facilitators and barriers to TUC in dental settings, preferences for specialist referral, and experiences of tobacco users attempting to quit, with dental professionals or specialist services, respectively...|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} of this study include its retrospective nature and our inability to review a number of factors previously associated with curve progression, such as curve flexibility, due to lack of appropriate documentation. We also decided to include only patients who met Scoliosis Research Society skeletal maturity criteria for bracing (Risser sign 0, 1, 2 at brace initiation) in order to provide as homogenous a cohort as possible where most practitioners would agree on the indication for bracing. However, this will limit the generalizability of this study to Risser 3 patients, who at some institutions, including our own, may be selectively given a trial of bracing. Length of follow-up is another potential limitation of our study, as it was not designed to follow the patients up to a specific time point, but rather until skeletal maturity was reached. This choice was made because bracing is typically employed until this clinical end-point and not for a set time period. As such, variable lengths of follow-up were obtained as patients progressed to maturity at variable rates. Since we did not follow patients past skeletal maturity, we cannot guarantee that there were no cases of late progression after skeletal maturity or brace discontinuation. However, this study did follow patients sufficiently through the traditional term of brace therapy and, therefore, the duration of follow-up can be considered to be reasonable for a study evaluating curve progression during the period of brace wear. Measurement of brace compliance is another potential limitation of our study, as compliance was only noted by self-report and was dichotomized, so this data may be susceptible to reporting bias and incremental differences in brace wear could not be quantified. Additionally, it is possible that a true association between risk of surgery and a high BMI does exist, but as surgery was the least common outcome among our study participants, our study may not have been adequately powered to detect such an association. Lastly, this study was conducted at a single tertiary care institution with <b>in-house</b> orthotic <b>specialists,</b> and as such it may not be generalizable to different populations, to community-based treatment centers, or to communities where the quality of orthoses is variable.|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} {{international}} trends, project-based learning is increasingly being {{viewed as an}} important feature of engineering education in the UK. The paper presents findings from a snapshot review of current approaches. Undertaken in 2009, the review was informed by consultations with UK and international experts and practitioners in engineering education, project-based learning and problem-based learning. It forms part of a wider programme of work at the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Programme at MIT to promote leadership and project-based learning in the engineering curriculum. The findings suggest that project-based activities are often developed by staff operating as lone 'champions' with limited time, resources and support. Given these structural constraints, approaches which have been 'tried and tested' elsewhere could provide robust models, particularly initiatives which are well-regarded by the engineering education community. However, evidence from the review indicates that many well-known approaches to project-based learning do not offer readily transferable models, either because they are catering to low student numbers on relatively high per capita budgets or because they are relying on <b>specialist</b> <b>in-house</b> expertise or equipment. Against this background, this paper discusses the key features of successful engineering project-based learning experiences in the UK. A selection of transferable best practice examples currently in operation is presented that could, potentially, be adopted 'out-of-the-box' at other institutions. The paper concludes by noting the importance of institutional support for the current and future success of project-based learning in the UK engineering curriculum...|$|R
