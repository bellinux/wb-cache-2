50|$|The {{total number}} of houses in Skelsmergh has seen a change since 1881 when we compare data from this time {{to the most recent}} {{recorded}} census data in 2011. The lowest <b>housing</b> <b>count</b> between these time periods was in 1901 where there was a total <b>housing</b> <b>count</b> of 63 which was 6 less than 10 years before. When assessing the census data on the {{total number of}} houses it is clear that there is an overall increase between 1881 and 2011. The most recent count shows a total number of households at a figure of 136. This figure makes up just {{a small percentage of the}} number of houses occupying the South Lakeland region, with the figure recording 46, 552 houses. The 2011 Census data shows that of the 136 houses, 125 were classified as a whole house or bungalow. If we wish to break down the housing type in more depth, this figure of 125 can be sub divided into detached (58), semi-detached (41) and terraced (26) housing, which added together give us this figure.|$|E

Further discrepancies exist because the houses were mediatized between 1806-14 and the rosters of the Princely and Comital mediatized houses were not drawn up until 1825 and 1829 respectively, during which period some families had become extinct or divested their mediate rights to the territories in question.|$|R
