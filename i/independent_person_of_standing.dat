In New Zealand the Algerian refugee, Ahmed Zaoui, wasincarcerated in {{a maximum}} {{security}} prison in solitary confinementon {{the strength of}} a report produced by the threat assessment unitof the Police. On 20 March 2003 a Security Risk Certificate was issued bythe Director of Security under Part 4 A of the Immigration Act that allows for ?persons [...] who pose a security risk ? where necessary[to] be effectively and quickly detained and removed or deportedfrom New Zealand? on the basis of classified security informationprovided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. This information can be considered and its use approved by?an <b>independent</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> high judicial <b>standing?</b> (the Inspector-General <b>of</b> Intelligence and Security) but ?the significance of theinformation in question in a security sense is such that its approveduse should mean that no further avenues are available to theindividual under this Act and that removal or deportation, as thecase may require, can normally proceed immediately?. There are two principal fora which might be used to assessclassified security information. These are the regular courts, andspecialised outside bodies, such as tribunals. There are also threemain options for providing procedural and substantive advocacy forthe tribunal or court ? independent counsel, counsel who haveobtained security clearance, or counsel to parties who must makethe best use they can of their limited access to classified material.

5000|$|In 1748 Gaspar da Costa {{sent his}} eldest son Baltazar {{together}} with a Dominican priest to France for educational purpose. In the next year {{the boy and his}} preceptor arrived to Lorient in France. The priest, however, disappeared with the goods and left Baltazar to fend for himself. The latter pursued {{the rest of his life}} as a ship's cook and a humble relief-seeker.

60|$|Of {{this matter}} of Hernan Pereira, Retief said little {{as we went}} back to the camp outside the Kraal, though the little that he did say showed his deep anger. When we arrived at the camp, however, he sent for Pereira and Marais and several of the older Boers. I {{remember}} that among these were Gerrit Bothma, Senior, Hendrik Labuschagne and Matthys Pretorius, Senior, all <b>of</b> them <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> <b>standing</b> and judgment. I also was ordered to be present. When Pereira arrived, Retief charged him openly with having plotted my murder, and asked him what he had to say. Of course, his answer was a flat denial, and an accusation against me of having invented the tale because we had been at enmity over a maiden whom I had since married.|$|R

He has already bought Blunt and Mardyke's farms, and purposes to buy {{other parts of the}} estates of Sir James Holford, as they may slip through the knight's fingers at the gambling table. Therefore, in time, you will become a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>standing</b> in the county; and although I care little for these things now, Phil, yet I should like you to be somewhat more than a mere squire; and if you serve for a while under such great captains as Coligny and Conde, it will give you reputation and weight.|$|R

50|$|Reaction to the abdication was muted. Everybody {{was afraid}} of what might happen next. The {{government}} refrained from challenging any assertions in the king's abdication statement for fear of arousing further controversy. Opponents of the government kept quiet because they felt intimidated and forsaken by the king whom they regarded as the only <b>person</b> capable <b>of</b> <b>standing</b> up to the regime. In other words, the absolutism of the monarchy {{had been replaced by}} that of the People's Party, with the military looming in the wings as the ultimate arbiter of power.|$|R

They involved a long string of conjectures, implicating in their wide ramifications several <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> important <b>standing</b> in the community.

60|$|He knew no artists, but he {{had read}} novels of Bohemian life in Paris, and he had {{gathered}} a general impression that they were, as a class, shock-headed, unwashed <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> no social <b>standing</b> whatever, extremely short of money and much addicted to orgies. And his sister had lowered herself by association with one of these.|$|R
6000|$|Insanity {{certainly}} {{is on the}} increase in the world, and crime is dying out. There are no longer any murders--none worth mentioning, at any rate. Formerly, if you killed a man, it was possible that you were insane--but now, if you, having friends and money, kill a man, it is evidence that you are a lunatic. In these days, too, if a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> good family and high social standing steals anything, they call it kleptomania, and send him to the lunatic asylum. If a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> high <b>standing</b> squanders his fortune in dissipation, and closes his career with strychnine or a bullet, [...] "Temporary Aberration" [...] is what was the trouble with him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{official}} histories had {{on occasion}} been threatened with political interference, {{particularly with the}} change in government in 1949.

[...] Other problems arose when authors were unable to complete their contracted volumes due to other commitments, poor health or one case, death. [...] It was often necessary for the War History Branch staff to step in and complete the outstanding work.|$|R
5000|$|Later troubadours {{especially}} could {{belong to}} lower classes, {{ranging from the}} middle class of merchants and [...] "burgers" [...] (<b>persons</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>standing)</b> to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands.

60|$|The first {{object to}} which he gave his {{attention}} was {{the organization of the}} people, and the framing of the general constitution of society. The community over which he was called to preside had consisted thus far of very heterogeneous and discordant materials. Vast numbers of the people were of the humblest and most degraded condition, consisting of ignorant peasants, some stupid, others turbulent and ungovernable; and of refugees from justice, such as thieves, robbers, and outlaws of every degree. But then, on the other hand, there were many <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> <b>standing</b> and respectability. The sons of families of wealth and influence in Alba had, in many cases, joined the expedition, and at last, when the building of the city had advanced so far as to make it appear that the enterprise might succeed, more men of age and character came to join it, so that Romulus found himself, when he formally assumed the kingly power, {{at the head of a}} community which contained the elements of a very respectable commonwealth. These elements were, however, thus far all mingled together in complete confusion, and the work that was first to be done was to adopt some plan for classifying and arranging them.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to examine the multidimensional {{challenges}} inhibiting the fight against corruption in Nigeria. With emphasis on litigation as a tool for fighting corruption, the paper reveals factors that contribute to corruption in Nigeria and efforts being made to combat it. It evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the legal framework and prosecution of corruption cases in Nigeria. The paper argues that the failure of the Nigerian State to effectively combat corruption is not attributable to inadequate or lack of enabling legal framework. While recognizing the right <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>standing</b> trial for corruption to a fair trial and meaningful day in court, it also highlights various challenges confronting defence counsel before and during trial <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>standing</b> trial for corruption. Finally, the paper recommends how corruption can be controlled in Nigeria...|$|R
25|$|Tongans {{make use}} of {{different}} Tongan words and expressions when addressing, referring to, or speaking in the presence <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> different social <b>standing.</b> It is a serious social mistake to use the wrong word in the wrong context.

50|$|Addressing {{in third}} person {{singular}} adding title and surname was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>standing,</b> say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when {{to use that}} title only and when to precede it with a herr ('mister' or, in this connection, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms. A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the feminine form of her husband's title {{as a matter of}} course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own.|$|R
