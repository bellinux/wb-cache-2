5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

40|$|An {{assessment}} of ground-water {{quality in the}} northern High Plains aquifer was completed during 1997 and 2002 – 04. Ground-water samples were collected at 192 low-capacity, primarily domestic wells in four major hydrogeologic units of the northern High Plains aquifer—Ogallala Formation, Eastern Nebraska, Sand Hills, and Platte River Valley. Each well was sampled once, and water samples were analyzed for physical properties and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, pesticides and pesticide degradates, dissolved solids, major ions, trace elements, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), radon, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Tritium and microbiology were analyzed at selected sites. The results of this assessment {{were used to determine}} the current water-quality conditions in this subregion of the High Plains aquifer and to relate ground-water quality to natural and human factors affecting water quality. Water-quality analyses indicated that water samples rarely exceeded established U. S. Environmental Protection Agency public drinking-water standards for those constituents sampled; 13 of the constituents measured or analyzed exceeded their respective standards in at least one sample. The constituents that most often failed to meet drinking-water standards were dissolved solids (13 percent of samples <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Secondary Drinking-Water Regulation) and arsenic (8 percent of samples <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contaminant Level). Nitrate, uranium, iron, and manganese concentrations were larger than drinking-water standards in 6 percent of the samples. Ground-water chemistry varied among hydrogeologic units. Wells sampled in the Platte River Valley and Eastern Nebraska units exceeded water-quality standards more often than the Ogallala Formation and Sand Hills units. Thirty-one percent of the samples collected in the Platte River Valley unit had nitrate concentrations greater than the standard, 22 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> manganese standard, 19 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> sulfate standard, 26 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> uranium standard, and 38 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> dissolved-solids standard. In addition, 78 percent of samples had at least one detectable pesticide and 22 percent of samples had at least one detectable VOC. In the Eastern Nebraska unit, 30 percent of the samples collected had dissolved-solids concentrations larger than the standard, 23 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> iron standard, 13 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> manganese standard, 10 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> arsenic standard, 7 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> sulfate standard, 7 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> uranium standard, and 7 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> selenium standard. No samples <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> nitrate standard. Thirty percent of samples had at least one detectable pesticide compound and 10 percent of samples had at least one detectable VOC. In contrast, the Sand Hills and Ogallala Formation units had fewer detections of anthropogenic compounds and drinking-water exceedances. In the Sand Hills unit, 15 percent of <b>the</b> samples <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> arsenic standard, 4 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> nitrate standard, 4 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> uranium standard, 4 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> iron standard, and 4 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> dissolved-solids standard. Fifteen percent of samples had at least one pesticide compound detected and 4 percent had at least one VOC detected. In the Ogallala Formation unit, 6 percent of water samples <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> arsenic standard, 4 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> dissolved-solids standard, 3 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> nitrate standard, 2 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> manganese standard, 1 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> iron standard, 1 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> sulfate standard, and 1 percent <b>exceeded</b> <b>the</b> uranium standard. Eight percent of samples collected in the Ogallala Formation unit had at least one pesticide detected and 6 percent had at least one VOC detected. Differences in ground-water chemistry among the hydrogeologic units were attributed to variable depth to water, depth of the well screen below the water table, reduction-oxidation conditions, ground-water residence time, interactions with surface water, composition of aquifer sediments, extent of cropland, extent of irrigated land, and fertilizer application rates...|$|R

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble <b>exceed</b> <b>the</b> combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
