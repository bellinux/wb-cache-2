They are intrusions that can only tend to bring this court into contempt, and make doubtful the boasts of that liberty that is the keynote of American Government.|$|E
500|$|Just {{prior to}} his {{departure}} for the front, the new army commander had held lengthy consultations with both Hitler and Halder. They impressed upon Model that great firmness {{would be necessary to}} save the army from destruction, and his vehement tone in reply so impressed Hitler that upon the General's departure he remarked: [...] "Did you see that eye? <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> man to do it, but I wouldn't want to serve under him". When Model took over, his sector was in a shambles: the Kalinin Front had broken through the line and was threatening the Moscow-Smolensk railway, the main supply route for Army Group Centre. Despite the danger, he realized the precarious position the attackers themselves were in and immediately counterattacked, cutting off the Soviet 39th Army. In the ferocious battles that followed, he repelled multiple Soviet attempts to relieve their trapped soldiers, the last being in February. He then squeezed out the pocket at his leisure, in a series of operations culminating in mid-July. For this, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross and promoted to colonel general (Generaloberst).|$|E
500|$|MacGregor {{said that}} he had come to London to attend King George IV's {{coronation}} on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—"religious and moral instructors... and persons to guide and assist you"—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be [...] "Vice-Cazique" [...] during his absence. [...] "POYERS!", the document concluded, [...] "I now bid you farewell for a while... <b>I</b> <b>trust,</b> <b>that</b> through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and yours to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father." [...] There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast.|$|E

500|$|Some vocal {{supporters}} of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: [...] "I am not afraid of communism... I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy." [...] Another wrote: [...] "the trial was a political trial... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear {{in the world at}} large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?... <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the... Smith bill unconstitutional." [...] William Z. Foster wrote: [...] "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American." [...] The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy.|$|E
500|$|A 200-page autobiographical {{account of}} her travels was {{published}} in July 1857 by James Blackwood as Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, the first autobiography written by a black woman in Britain. Priced at one shilling and six pence (1/6) a copy, the cover bears a striking portrait of Seacole in red, yellow and black ink. Robinson speculates that she dictated the work to an editor, identified in the book only as W.J.S., who improved her grammar and orthography. In the work Seacole deals with the first 39years {{of her life in}} one short chapter. She then expends six chapters on her few years in Panama, before using the following 12chapters to detail her exploits in Crimea. She avoids mention of the names of her parents and precise date of birth. A short final [...] "Conclusion" [...] deals with her return to England, and lists supporters of her fund-raising effort, including Rokeby, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Newcastle, William Russell, and other prominent men in the military. The book was dedicated to Major-General Lord Rokeby, commander of the First Division; and William Howard Russell wrote as a preface, [...] "I have witnessed her devotion and her courage... and <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> England will never forget one who has nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and succour them and who performed the last offices for some of her illustrious dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E
