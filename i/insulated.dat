40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>insulating</b> lids on the {{convection}} beneath were investigated experimentally using rectangular convection {{cells in the}} flux Rayleigh number range 2. 3 × 10 ^ 9 ≤ Ra_F ≤ 1. 8 × 10 ^ 11 and cylindrical cells in the range 1. 4 × 10 ^ 10 ≤ Ra_F ≤ 1. 2 × 10 ^ 12 with the Prandtl number Pr fixed at 4. 3. It is found {{that the presence of}} the <b>insulating</b> lids leads to reduction of the global heat transfer efficiency as expected, which primarily depends on the <b>insulating</b> area but is insensitive to the detailed <b>insulating</b> patterns. At the leading order level, the magnitude of temperature fluctuation in the bulk fluid is, again, found to be insensitive to the <b>insulating</b> pattern and mainly depends on the <b>insulating</b> area; while the temperature probability density function (PDF) in the bulk is essentially invariant with respect to both <b>insulating</b> area and the spatial pattern of the lids. The flow dynamics, on the other hand, is sensitive to both the covering area and the spatial distribution of the lids. At fixed Ra_F, the flow strength is found to increase with increasing <b>insulating</b> area so as to transfer the same amount of heat through a smaller cooling area. Moreover, for a constant <b>insulating</b> area, a symmetric <b>insulating</b> pattern results in a symmetric flow pattern, i. e. double-roll structure; whereas asymmetric <b>insulating</b> pattern leads to asymmetric flow, i. e. single-roll structure. It is further found that the symmetry breaking of the <b>insulating</b> pattern leads to a stronger flow that enhances the horizontal velocity more than the vertical one.

5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and <b>insulated</b> by the river.
