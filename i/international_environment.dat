In January 1998, Milo Đukanović became Montenegro's president, following bitterly contested elections in November 1997, which were declared free and fair by international monitors. His coalition followed up with parliamentary elections in May. Having weathered Milošević's campaign to undermine his government, Đukanović has struggled to balance the pro-independence stance of his coalition with the changed domestic and <b>international</b> <b>environment</b> of the post-5 October Balkans.

Eventually, public debates and discussions led to a broad rewriting of the Mudawana in 2003–4, which many attribute to the increase in activity and organization within Moroccan civil society in the 1990s as well as a changing <b>international</b> <b>environment</b> surrounding women's rights and gender equality. Beginning in the 1990s, women’s rights organizations in Morocco gained leverage and influence by incorporating progressive elements from academia, publishing, and government, and using rhetoric that drew from Islamic sources as well as the language of national development and the rights of women and children.|$|E

40|$|Australian wheat {{breeding}} {{programs are}} currently evaluating and using advanced breeding {{lines from the}} International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement (CIMMYT). A more coordinated and efficient procedure for identifying useful lines for Australian breeding programs was evaluated by assessing the potential for exploiting correlated response to selection for grain yield between CIMMYT international and Australian evaluation trials. The genetic correlation, based on 40 common lines, between average line performance across 18 international and six Australian environments was high (0. 813 ± 0. 049), indicating considerable potential for exploiting correlated response to selection for broad grain yield adaptation to the Australian environments for selection on broad adaptation in the <b>international</b> <b>environments.</b> The potential to select for specific grain yield adaptation to the individual Australian environments was investigated and individual <b>international</b> <b>environments</b> were identified which expressed a higher genetic correlation with the Australian environments than did average performance over all of the <b>international</b> <b>environments.</b> Therefore, opportunity exists for Australian wheat breeders to use the principles of indirect selection to select among advanced CIMMYT wheat lines on grain yield performance in international performance trials for both broad and specific grain yield adaptation to Australian environments prior {{to the introduction of}} this material to Australia. Since genotype by environment interaction for yield in the international trials is large and its causes are not well understood, selection for specific adaptation on the results from individual trials will require further investigation of the individual relationships...|$|R

2500|$|Richard T. Arndt, {{a former}} State Department {{cultural}} diplomacy practitioner, said [...] "Cultural relations grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions {{of trade and}} tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If that is correct, cultural diplomacy can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests." [...] It {{is important to note}} that, while cultural diplomacy is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. Cultural diplomacy attempts to manage the <b>international</b> <b>environment</b> by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad. [...] An important aspect of this is listening- cultural diplomacy is meant to be a two-way exchange. [...] This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities. It is seen as a silent weapon in gaining control over another nation with the use of non-violent methods to perpetrate a relationship of mutual understanding and support among the countries involved.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1963, the Ovshinskys had {{exhausted}} the savings with which they had initially funded ECL. [...] Before seeking public funding, Stan wanted validation {{of the importance of}} his work from a well-recognized scientist. [...] He telephoned Nobel Laureate John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor and co-discoverer of the BCS theory of superconductivity. [...] Bardeen immediately recognized the importance of Ovshinsky's work but his schedule did not permit him to visit ECL for five months. [...] Stan replied, [...] "We'll be broke by then." [...] In his place, Bardeen sent Hellmut Fritzsche, a University of Chicago physicist. Fritzsche became very positive in his support of Ovshinsky's work and helped attract other scientists to the Ovshinsky laboratory. As Fritzsche and Brian Schwartz later wrote, [...] "There is a mysterious quality in Ovshinsky's persona that attracts people into his sphere, builds life long friendships and awakens deep respect and devotion. [...] Meeting him leaves each person with a deep impression of his superior intellect, his self confidence, his compassion to improve society combined with his certainty that his vision can be realized. His enthusiasm is contagious. [...] In his presence, you feel how exciting it would be to join him in his endeavors." [...] Among the many famous scientists who came regularly to ECL as friends or collaborators over the next years, were David Adler, Bardeen, Arthur Bienenstock, Morrel Cohen, Kenichi Fukui, William Lipscomb, Sir Nevill Mott, Linus Pauling, Isadore I. Rabi, Edward Teller, David Turnbull, Victor Weisskopf, and Robert R. Wilson. [...] Some joined as consultants or as members of the Board of Directors. [...] Meanwhile, the ECL community developed a uniquely productive, non-hierarchical, multicultural, <b>international</b> <b>environment,</b> reflecting Stan and Iris' social values.

40|$|Classification {{methodology}} {{is widely}} used by plant breeders to group environments {{on the results of}} regional evaluation trials to assist in selection among genotypes. To be effective, this strategy must be integrated with the theory of indirect selection. Environments which group together should reflect commonality of genotypic discrimination and therefore give rise to similar selection among genotypes. Four strategies for classifying environments were compared. These were based on untransformed and three forms of transformed data (coded, standardised and rank). The comparison assessed how effectively the groups of environments formed by using each transformation maximised the opportunity for exploiting indirect selection between environments within the same group relative to environments in other groups. The objective in this study was to identify groups of <b>international</b> <b>environments,</b> used by CIMMYT in its international nursery program, which gave high indirect response to selection for grain yield in six Australian environments. Generally the four classification strategies identified subsets of <b>international</b> <b>environments</b> for which selection gave a greater indirect response than that for selection on average performance across all of the <b>international</b> <b>environments</b> (35 % to 94 % on average over all Australian environments). Environmental classifications based on the standardised and rank transformations were generally superior to those based on the untransformed and coded transformations (46 % on average over all Australian environments). The magnitude of this advantage differed between the Australian environments but was substantial for the two environments which expressed the greatest opportunity for exploiting indirect selection. These results have obvious and large implications for the use of classification methodology to structure regional testing regimes for plant breeding programs...|$|R
