5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In this {{descriptive}} study, it {{was aimed}} to assess attitudes and behaviours of some taxi-drivers <b>in</b> Ankara on <b>the</b> smoking ban <b>in</b> <b>cabs</b> under <b>the</b> Law of Preventing the Harmful effects of Tobacco Products. Material and Methods: Face to face interviews {{were done with}} 277 taxi-drivers by visiting taxi stations in Altındag and Çankaya districts. Additionally, breath carbon monoxide levels were measured in some drivers after obtaining their informed consent. As {{a part of this}} study, the actual smoking status of the drivers and/or clients were recorded by observing the travelling taxies on the junctions of the main streets of the two districts of Ankara. Results: Sixty-four percent of taxi drivers (177 of 277) were current smokers. The majority of these current smokers (108 of 177; 61. 0 %) reported that they also smoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabs.</b> While {{more than half of the}} respondents (55. 2 %) supported <b>the</b> smoking ban <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabs,</b> one third (33. 2 %) of the drivers strongly disagreed with this legislation. Among the taxi drivers, there was an agreement on supporting <b>the</b> smoking bans <b>in</b> certain public places like court halls and the town bus stations (80. 2 % and 73. 6 % respectively), but on the other hand, they s were less supportive of <b>the</b> bans <b>in</b> cafes and restaurants, particularly serving alcoholic drink (41. 5 % and 32. 9 % respectively). Non-smoker drivers supported the smoking ban legislations more. Conclusion: Findings showed that compliance with the items of the Law which ban smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabs,</b> were not sufficient. In daily life many traffic policemen are responsible for the regulation of the traffic. It will be efficacious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eradication of smoke from <b>the</b> <b>cabs,</b> if these traffic police are informed about their authorization and duty on the tobacco control, including fining the taxi drivers who ignore the smoking ban legislation...|$|R

5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a boom in}} {{skyscraper}} {{construction in}} Chicago from 1888 onwards. By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered {{in the center of}} the financial district. Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories. Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right. Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings.|$|E

These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.|$|E

25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E
