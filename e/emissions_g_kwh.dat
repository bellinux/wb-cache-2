40|$|A {{reliable}} and up-to-date maritime emission inventory {{is essential for}} atmospheric scientists quantifying the impact of shipping. The objective {{of this study is}} to estimate the atmospheric emissions of SO 2, NO x, CO 2 and PM 10 by international merchant shipping in 2007 in the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain, including the Algeciras Bay by two methods. Two methods (both bottom-up) have been used in this study: 1. Establishing engine power-based <b>emission</b> factors (<b>g</b> <b>kWh</b> − 1, EPA) or the mass of pollutant per work performed by the engine for each of the relevant components of the exhaust gas from diesel engines and power for each ship. 2. Establishing fuel-based emission factors (kg emitted/t of fuel) or mass of pollutant per mass of combusted fuel for each of the relevant components of the exhaust gas and a fuel-consumption inventory (IMO). In both methods, the means to estimate engine power and fuel-consumption inventories are the same. The exhaust from boilers and incinerators is regarded as a small contributor and excluded. In total, an estimated average of 1 389 111. 05 t of CO 2, 23 083. 09 t of SO 2, 32 005. 63 t of NO x and 2972 t of PM 10 were emitted from January 2007 until December 2007 by international and domestic shipping. The estimated total fuel consumption amounts to 437 405. 84 t. The major differences between the estimates generated by the two methods are for NO x (16 % in certain cases) and CO (up to 23 %). A total difference for all compounds of 3038 t (approximately 2 %) has been found between the two methods but it is not areasonable estimate of uncertainty. Therefore, the results for both methods may be considered acceptable because the actual uncontrolled deviations appear in the changes in emission factors that occur for a given engine with age. These deviations are often difficult to quantify and depend on individual shipboard service and maintenance routines. Emission factors for CO and NO x are not constant and depend on engine condition. For example, tests conducted by the authors of this paper demonstrate that when an engine operates under normal in-service conditions, the emissions are within limits. However, with a small fault in injection timing, the NO x emission exceeds the limits (30 % higher value in some cases). A fault in the maintenance of the injection nozzles increases the CO emission (15 % higher value in some cases) ...|$|R

The FWC and ESD calculations appear to be consistent from a physics point of view, as long as calculations are well-documented.

The chemical efficiency {{of the system is}} determined by measuring ozone production. The temporal and spatial development of the discharge streamers is recorded using an ICCD camera with a shortest exposure time of 5 ns. The camera can be triggered at any moment starting from the time the voltage pulse arrives on the reactor, with an accuracy of less than 1 ns. Measurements were performed on an industrial size wire-plate reactor. The influence of pulse parameters like pulse voltage, DC bias voltage, rise-time and pulse repetition rate on plasma generation was monitored. It was observed that for higher peak voltages, an increase could be seen in the primary streamer velocity, the growth of the primary streamer diameter, the light intensity and the number of streamers per unit length of corona wire. No significant separate influence of DC bias voltage level was observed as long as the total reactor voltage (pulse + DC bias) remained constant and the DC bias voltage remained below the DC corona onset. For those situations in which the plasma appearance changed (e. g. different streamer velocity, diameter, intensity), a change in ozone production was also observed. The best chemical yields were obtained for low voltage (55 kV), low energetic pulses (0. 4 J/pulse) : 60 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1. For high voltage (86 kV), high energetic pulses (2. 3 J/pulse) the yield decreased to approximately 45 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1, still a high value for ozone production in ambient air (RH 42 %).

Heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) have been considered a major contributor to NO x emissions in China. Beijing initiated a comprehensive vehicle test program in 2008. This program included a sub-task for measuring on-road emission profiles of hundreds of HDDVs using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The major finding is that neither the on-road distance-specific (g km − 1) nor brake-specific (<b>g</b> <b>kWh</b> − 1) NO x emission factors for diesel buses and heavy-duty diesel trucks improved in most cases as emission standards became more stringent. For example, the average NO x emission factors for Euro II, Euro III and Euro IV buses are 11. 3 ± 3. 3 g km − 1, 12. 5 ± 1. 3 g km − 1, and 11. 8 ± 2. 0 g km − 1, respectively. No statistically significant difference in NO x emission factors was observed between Euro II and III buses. Even for Euro IV buses equipped with SCR systems, the NO x emission factors are similar to Euro III buses. The data regarding real-time engine performance of Euro IV buses suggest the engine certification cycles did not reflect their real-world operating conditions. These new on-road test results indicate that previous estimates of total NO x emissions for HDDV fleet may be significantly underestimated. The new estimate in total NO x emissions for the Beijing HDDV fleet in 2009 is 37. 0 Gg, an increase of 45 % compared to the previous study. Further, we estimate that the total NO x emissions for the national HDDV fleet in 2009 are approximately 4. 0 Tg, higher by 1. 0 Tg (equivalent to 18 % of total NO x emissions for vehicle fleet in 2009) than that estimated in the official report.
