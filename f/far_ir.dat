50|$|By {{mechanically}} {{moving the}} knife edge across the beam, {{the amount of}} energy impinging the detector area is determined by the obstruction. The profile is then measured from the knife-edge velocity and its relation to the detector's energy reading. Unlike other systems, a unique scanning technique uses several different oriented knife-edges to sweep across the beam. By using tomographic reconstruction, mathematical processes reconstruct the laser beam size in different orientations to an image similar to the one produced by CCD cameras. The main advantage of this scanning method is that it is free from pixel size limitations (as in CCD cameras) and allows beam reconstructions with wavelengths not usable with existing CCD technology.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{scanning}} aperture techniques are the knife-edge technique and the scanning-slit profiler. The former chops the beam {{with a knife}} and measures the transmitted power as the blade cuts through the beam. The measured intensity versus knife position yields a curve that is the integrated beam intensity in one direction. By measuring the intensity curve in several directions, the original beam profile can be reconstructed using algorithms developed for x-ray tomography. Tomographic laser beam profilers were originally developed as a measuring instrument by Duma Optronics [...] The measuring instrument is based on high precision multiple knife edges each deployed on a rotating drum and having a different angle with respect to beam orientation. Scanned beam is then reconstructed using tomographic algorithms and provides 2D or 3D high resolution energy distribution plots. Because of the special scanning technique the system automatically zooms in onto the current beam size enabling high resolution measurements of sub micron beams as well as relative large beams of 10 or more millimeters. To obtain measurement of various wavelength different detectors are used to allow laser beam measurements from deep UV to <b>far</b> <b>IR.</b> Unlike other camera based systems this technology also provides accurate power measurement in real timeScanning-slit profilers use a narrow slit instead of a single knife edge.

This size, together with optical and IR data that show the galaxy is probably gravitationally lensed, lead to a new model for the CO distribution. In contrast to many lensed objects, we have a good estimate of the intrinsic CO and <b>far</b> <b>IR</b> surface brightnesses, so we can derive the CO and far IR/sub-mm magnifications. The CO is magnified 10 times and has a true radius of 400 pc. and the <b>far</b> <b>IR</b> is magnified 13 times and has a radius of 250 pc. The true <b>far</b> <b>IR</b> luminosity is 4 to 7 e 12 Lsun and the molecular gas mass is 2 e 10 Msun. This is nearly an order of magnitude less than previously estimated.

40|$|The optical {{response}} of graphene micro-structures, such as micro-ribbons and disks, {{is dominated by}} the localized plasmon resonance in the <b>far</b> infrared (<b>IR)</b> spectral range. An ensemble of such structures is usually involved and the effect of the coupling between the individual structures is expected to play an important role. In this paper, the plasmonic coupling of graphene microstructures in different configurations is investigated. While a relatively weak coupling between graphene disks on the same plane is observed, the coupling between vertically stacked graphene disks is strong and a drastic increase of the resonance frequency is demonstrated. The plasmons in a more complex structure can be treated as the hybridization of plasmons from more elementary structures. As an example, the plasmon resonances of graphene micro-rings are presented, in conjunction with their response in a magnetic field. Finally, the coupling of the plasmon and the surface polar phonons of SiO 2 substrate is demonstrated by the observation of a new hybrid resonance peak around 500 cm- 1.

For the <b>Far</b> <b>IR</b> region we used a custom made vacuum microscope adapted to an FTIR spectrometer. Pressure induced changes in the Mid and <b>Far</b> <b>IR</b> spectra were analysed via the autocorrelation method for all five pressure series. All five series confirm the monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transition at about 2. 3 GPa already known from X ray diffraction studies.
