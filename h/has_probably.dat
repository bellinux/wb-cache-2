5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, although it <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate {{and this has}} spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson streamliner might have hauled the blue trainset. Such an event <b>has,</b> <b>probably</b> uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E

5|$|Halley <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been in {{its current}} orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although}} {{it is not possible to}} numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been erupting for {{at least}} 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which has been {{responsible}} for the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Much of this <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> {{been due}} to its wealth of {{skeletal}} remains and former status as the longest dinosaur. The donation of many mounted skeletal casts by industrialist Andrew Carnegie to potentates around {{the world at the}} beginning of the 20th century did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.|$|E

5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> {{been taking}} place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} is triggered when Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been intimidated {{by members of}} a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan {{that no one is}} investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes {{a significant portion of the}} city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been {{a church}} {{on the site of}} the present St Chad's since before the Norman conquest of England in 1066, and there is written {{evidence}} of one from 1094. The Domesday Book of 1086 mentioned three churches in the hundred of Amounderness, although they were not named. Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton, Kirkham and St Michael's on Wyre. The dedication of Poulton's church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094.|$|E

5000|$|Deposited around [...] as {{the kingdom}} of Sussex was being established, the Patching hoard of coins {{represents}} the earliest early mediaeval coins found in Britain. [...] The hoard includes five imported siliquae {{that had not been}} clipped, so coin-clipping <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> ceased by then, although the coinage <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> collapsed decades earlier than this, after Roman rule in Britain collapsed.|$|R

5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of some 2000 examples, one {{commentator}} has argued that “Gray’s Elegy <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> inspired more adaptations than any other poem in the language”. It has also been suggested that parody acts {{as a kind of}} translation into the same tongue as the original, something that the printing history of some examples seems to confirm. One of the earliest, John Duncombe’s “An evening contemplation in a college” (1753), frequently reprinted {{to the end of the}} 18th century, was included alongside translations of the Elegy into Latin and Italian in the 1768 and 1775 Dublin editions and 1768 Cork edition of Gray’s works. In the case of the American The Political Passing Bell: An Elegy. Written in a Country Meeting House, April 1789; Parodized from Gray for the Entertainment of Those Who Laugh at All Parties by George Richards (d.1804) and published from Boston MA, the parody was printed opposite Gray's original page by page, making the translation to the political context more obvious.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in fact be nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E
5|$|The fungus <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been {{introduced}} elsewhere, often {{because of the}} use of imported mulch used in gardening and landscaping. It may have extended its range northwards into the British Isles or {{been introduced}} in the nineteenth century. It now has a mainly southerly distribution in England and has been recorded from Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, the Isle of Wight, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, and Middlesex. In Scotland, it has been recorded from Argyll. It is also known from Wales, the Channel Islands, and Ireland. The fungus also occurs in the United States (California, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, and New York), Canada, Mexico, and Australasia. The species was also reported from South America (Argentina). In China, it has been collected from Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Tibet. Records from Japan are referable to Clathrus kusanoi; records from the Caribbean are probably of C.crispus.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel's heavily cratered surface <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> been stable {{since the}} Late Heavy Bombardment. The only {{signs of the}} ancient {{internal}} activity are canyons and dark polygons—dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The polygons were identified from precise photometry of Voyager 2s images and are distributed more or less uniformly {{on the surface of}} Umbriel, trending northeast–southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity. Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called umbral material) excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption. Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window {{features}} {{largely in}} Palladio's work and {{is almost a}} trademark of his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an impost consisting of a small entablature, under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are pilasters. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that {{first appeared in the}} triumphal arches of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrances to both Villa Godi and Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window <b>has</b> <b>probably</b> {{become one of the most}} enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.|$|E
