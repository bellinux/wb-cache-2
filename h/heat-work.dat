40|$|Chemical {{theories}} involving thermodynamical equilibrium states invariably utilize statistical {{mechanical equilibrium}} density distributions. Here, {{a definition of}} <b>heat-work</b> transformation termed thermo mechanical coherence is first made, and it is conjectured that most molecular bonds have the above <b>heat-work</b> transformation property, which models a chemical bond as a "`centrifugal heat engine"'. Expressions are derived for the standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy where the bond coordinates need not conform to a non degenerate Boltzmann state, since bond breakdown and formation are processes that have direction, whereas equilibrium distributions are derived when the Hamiltonian is of fixed form, {{which is not the}} case for chemical reactions using localized Hamiltonians. The empirically determined Gibbs free energy from a known molecular dynamics simulation of a dimer reaction 2 A [...] > A_ 2, accords rather well with the theoretical estimate. A relation connecting the rate of reaction with the equilibrium constant and other kinetic parameters is derived and could place the commonly observed linear relationship between the logarithms of the rate constant and equilibrium constant on a firmer theoretical footing. These relationships could include analogues of the Hammett correlations used extensively in physical organic chemistry, as well as others which are temperature dependent.

40|$|Coarse-graining the {{description}} of a fluctuating heat engine can change its apparent dissipative feature and affect the estimated efficiency. We here explicitly show that the Feynman-Smoluchowski (FS) ratchet, a classical thought experiment describing an autonomous <b>heat-work</b> converter, suffers from this very problem of hidden dissipation. Through singular perturbation analysis of the original FS ratchet model, we obtain the exact form of the coarse-grained dynamics, {{which turns out to}} be the Büttiker-Landauer motor, another classical model of Brownian heat engine. Explicit forms of the hidden entropy productions provide a unified understanding on how the original argument by Feynman led to the overestimated efficiency. The approach serves as a key example of how we can systematically address the problem of thermodynamic efficiency in a multi-variable fluctuating system. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find more {{correlations}} between entropy and other related quantities, an analogical analysis is conducted between thermal science and other branches of physics. Potential energy in various forms {{is the product of}} a conserved extensive quantity (for example, mass or electric charge) and an intensive quantity which is its potential (for example, gravitational potential or electrical voltage), while energy in specific form is a dissipative quantity during irreversible transfer process (for example mechanical or electrical energy will be dissipated as thermal energy). However, it has been shown that heat or thermal energy, like mass or electric charge, is conserved during heat transfer processes. When a heat transfer process is for object heating or cooling, the potential of internal energy U is the temperature T and its potential “energy” is UT/ 2 (called entransy and it is the simplified expression of thermomass potential energy); when a heat transfer process is for <b>heat-work</b> conversion, the potential of internal energy U is (1 − T 0 /T), and the available potential energy of a system in reversible heat interaction with the environment is U − U 0 − T 0 (S − S 0), then T 0 /T and T 0 (S − S 0) are the unavailable potential and the unavailable potential energy of a system respectively. Hence, entropy is related to the unavailable potential energy per unit environmental temperature for <b>heat-work</b> conversion during reversible heat interaction between the system and its environment. Entropy transfer, like other forms of potential energy transfer, is the product of the heat and its potential, the reciprocal of temperature, although it is in form of the quotient of the heat and the temperature. Thus, the physical essence of entropy transfer is the unavailable potential energy transfer per unit environmental temperature. Entropy is a non-conserved, extensive, state quantity of a system, and entropy generation in an irreversible heat transfer process is proportional to the destruction of available potential energy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{object of}} the study is to present a method of {{thermodynamic}} optimization of power generating plants, in a mode that consolidates and simplifies the analysis of data on <b>heat-work</b> interaction of the plant components. The optimization scheme identifies the technical and process parameters that can improve the thermodynamic performance of the plant with respect to an objective variable, and further, the required thermodynamic measures necessary to improve the operating condition of the plant. Simple but effective tools are used to evaluate the optimal and suboptimal power generating capacities vis-à-vis the fundamental variables—namely, the thermodynamic quantity ratio (TQR) and the power-energy quantity ratio (PQR) —without routing optimization procedures. Beyond the optimal value of the objective variable, the power generation capacity of the plant is affected. The determination of the optimal value of the objective variable can also be approached by computerization; for fixed prescriptions of the boiler, superheater, and turbine parameters, variables such as boiler pressure and temperature can be optimally selected.

40|$|Every {{student of}} {{thermodynamics}} grasps entropy growth {{in terms of}} dissipation of energy. The real nature of energy and entropy is subtle. This critical review {{of the evolution of}} thermodynamic thought uncovers the remarkable advance on our understanding of energy made by Kelvin with his dissipation of energy proposition. Maxwell and Planck, however, pointed out that dissipation of energy does not exhaust growth of entropy (i. e., the idea of spontaneity), and in fact, as it is shown here, Kelvin’s proposition of dissipation of energy (1852) is subsumed under the principle of the increase of entropy (Clausius, 1865). It is necessary, therefore, for thermodynamics to become a coherent conceptual system, to introduce spontaneity as an independent concept. Instead of the <b>heat-work</b> dyad framework, the introduction of spontaneity entails energy transformation to be viewed in terms of a triad framework of heat (from the reservoir) -work-spontaneity. Spontaneity is the new energy in the triad framework, and {{it is also clear that}} energy commodity (fungible energy or energy carriers) is only one kind of spontaneity, stock spontaneity; the other kind is ongoing spontaneity, the consideration of which is necessary for comprehending problems of homeostasis in both the organic and inorganic worlds...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} systems considered {{here are}} those that can be described by using only two macroscopic variables. For this purpose the specific volume v and the specific internal energy u are used while the pressure function p(u,v) {{is supposed to be}} known. It is shown that by a suitable mathematical transformation of variables, the pair (u,v) can be replaced by the pair of functions temperature T(u,v) and entropy s(u,v) that are defined simultaneously by a proposed generic system of differential equations without using the concept of heat. To show the authenticity of these definitions some solutions of this generic system of differential equations are given and in addition to, the special case of the perfect gas is obtained as one of the results. It is proposed to add to the conventional concepts of work and heat a third constitutive component, the throttling. With it the local efficiency η of a differential thermodynamic change can be defined. In addition this allows for the deduction of the relation (pdv+du) ≥ 0 as a consequence. The <b>heat-work</b> energy interactions with a thermodynamic system are taking place mostly through an enclosing boundary wall. As these two different forms of energy flow cross the boundary wall, they undergo some transformation. As a result, the heat and work flow through the wall from/to the outer space to/from the system considered may change, although its algebraic sum, the total energy transferred, retains its initial value. Vector notation is used to facilitate the description of this transformation of energy crossing a boundary wall...|$|E
