40|$|The {{inclusion}} of migrants into the labour market {{is considered a}} key issue {{in order to achieve}} better overall integration. However, compared to the German population, unemployment rates are around twice as high among foreigners. One important knob to improve access to the labour market lies in publicly funded counselling and services, a field which has undergone fundamental policy reforms in recent years. In order to illuminate the realities of everyday-encounters between authoritative services and unemployed migrants, to identify possible shortcomings and draw some conclusions for policy development, this paper focuses on the subjective views and experiences of migrants related to the various employment services and agencies. On the basis of a qualitative interview sample, several patterns of experiences within public employment-related agencies are identified, including the perceived role of counsellors, courses and training measures, questions of diversity, discrimination and transparency as well as the overall outcome in terms of <b>job</b> <b>referral</b> and <b>service</b> evaluation.

We compare the labor market experiences following application to the ES of individuals who receive ES <b>job</b> <b>referrals</b> with the experiences {{of those who do}} not receive referrals. Extensive evidence is presented indicating that the not-referred group is a reliable comparison group for estimating the impact of ES referrals on applicant labor market experiences. Our impact estimates indicate that there are significant and sizable effects of a <b>job</b> <b>referral</b> for women, resulting in increased earnings and reduced length of time to reemployment. The impacts of a <b>job</b> <b>referral</b> for men, however, are not significantly different from zero. ...|$|R

40|$|In many industries, Internet <b>referral</b> <b>services,</b> hosted {{either by}} {{independent}} third-party infomediaries or by manufacturers, serve as digitally enabled lead generators in electronic markets, directing consumer traffic to downstream retailers in a distribution network. This reshapes the extended enterprise {{from the traditional}} network of upstream manufacturers and downstream retailers to include midstream third-party and manufacturerowned <b>referral</b> <b>services</b> in the supply chain. We model competition between retailers in a supply chain with such digitally enabled institutions and consider {{their impact on the}} optimal contracts among the manufacturer, referral intermediary, and the retailers. Offline, retailers face a higher customer discovery cost. In return, they can engage in price discrimination based on consumer valuations. Online, they save on the discovery costs but lose the ability to identify consumer valuations. This critical trade-off drives firms’ equilibrium strategies. We derive the optimal contracts for different entities in the supply chain and highlight how these contracts change with the entry of independent and manufacturer-owned <b>referral</b> <b>services.</b> The establishment of a <b>referral</b> <b>service</b> is a strategic decision by the manufacturer. It leads to diversion of supply chain profit from a third-party infomediary to the manufacturer. Further, it enables the manufacturer to respond to an infomediary, by giving itself greater flexibility in setting the unit wholesale fee to the profit-maximizing level. Both third-party and manufacturer-sponsored <b>referral</b> <b>services</b> {{play a critical role in}} enabling retailers to discriminate across consumers’ different valuations. Retailers use online <b>referral</b> <b>services</b> to screen out low-valuation consumers and sell only to high-valuation consumers in the online channel. Our model thus endogenously derives a correlation between consumer valuation and online purchase behavior. Finally, we show that under some circumstances, it is too costly for the manufacturer to eliminate the referral infomediaryNYU, Stern School of Business, IOMS Department, Center for Digital Economy Researc...|$|R
