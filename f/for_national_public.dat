In April 2002, Aziz chaired a historical meeting on behalf of Pakistan and United States, helped the G7 members to understand the useful information how the illicit money is transferred was shared with the finance ministers of G7 members and Pakistan on other side.|$|E

500|$|Martin Kaste, South America {{correspondent}} <b>for</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> Radio, {{reported on}} April 9, 2002 that since their announcement {{that they were}} going to sue Fox, the Riotur officials had been told by their lawyers in the United States that it would be difficult to sue the episode there because of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects parodies. The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks soon issued a statement saying: [...] "We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro. And if that doesn't settle the issue, Homer Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on Fox's Celebrity Boxing." [...] Spokespersons for Fox told the press that they had not received nearly as much criticism with previous episodes that poked fun at other nations. Showrunner Al Jean has said in an interview that [...] "Every other place has had a good sense of humor. Brazil caught us by surprise." [...] When [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] eventually aired in Brazil in December 2002, there was a statement at the beginning noting that Fox is not responsible for the vision of the producers behind the episode.|$|E
500|$|The book {{generally}} received positive reception from literature critics. Publishers Weekly {{described it}} as [...] "golden SF from the Golden Age", and The Harvard Crimson called it [...] "one of the great classics" [...] of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented: [...] "Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy {{of those who would}} conquer it", and called the book [...] "one of his [...] finest works". Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle, writing: [...] "As in a number of groundbreaking -- or time-breaking, I suppose we ought to say -- works of science fiction, the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself. Hubbard is a thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are." [...] Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece <b>for</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> Radio's program All Things Considered: [...] "Before he began founding new religions, Hubbard was one of the country's most prolific pulp science fiction writers, and this book is one of his best." [...] Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes [...] "besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time-dilation effects in long distance near-light-speed space travel, (To The Stars) is a pretty entertaining story." ...|$|E
