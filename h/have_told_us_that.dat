2500|$|In {{a public}} address in October 2010 on Al-Aqsa TV, Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Maqri, Head of Moroccan and Algerian Delegation to the Gaza Convoy, stated, {{according}} to a translation published by MEMRI, that [...] "the mujahideen <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> they decided not to defeat the oppressive Jews by gunfire, but instead, by daggers." ...|$|E
2500|$|New York {{personal}} injury attorney Howard Hershenhorn filed a negligence lawsuit for Robert Dirks' wife Christine Ueda. It names Metro North, the train engineer Steven Smalls Jr., Westchester County {{and the town}} of Mount Pleasant among the defendants. The complaint lists bad visibility, poorly designed third rail, local official negligence and unsafe speed among the reasons for the defendants' alleged negligence. [...] "We are going to focus on the operation of the train and the train operator and his failure to recognize and stop the train," [...] Hershenhorn said. [...] "We have spoken with qualified experts who <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> these are very strong areas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes {{you would}} indeed; I know you {{better than you}} know yourself. You would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we seemed born for each other, or some {{nonsense}} of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I {{would not have had}} you by for the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Grant," [...] he said, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> on {{the night}} in {{question}} you had Count Samoval under observation, and that upon word being brought to you of his movements by one of your agents you yourself followed him to Monsanto. Would you {{be good enough to}} tell the court why you were watching the deceased's movements at the time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There is a proverb--or a saying--or {{at least}} {{somebody}} or book <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> some Irishman once said--"Be aisy, or, if ye can't be aisy, be as aisy as ye can." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{her great}} {{grandmother}} was a Frenchwoman of rank, and as I regarded her this Christmas Eve, I seemed {{to see the}} proud dame of the fallen monarchy living again in the imperious form of her descendant.|$|R
6000|$|Now as Mr. Leaf <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we must {{depend on}} [...] "fundamental discrepancies," [...] "on these alone," [...] {{when we want}} to dissect the ILIAD; as he <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{linguistic}} tests alone are [...] "not sufficient to bear the superstructure," [...] &c., how can we lop off two Books [...] "only on account of linguistic evidence"? It would appear that on this point, as on others, Mr. Leaf has entirely changed his mind. But, even in the Companion (p. 388), he had amputated Book XXIV. for no [...] "fundamental discrepancy," [...] but because of [...] "its close kinship to the ODYSSEY, as in the whole language of the Book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, books! Cicero and Ovid <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> to {{literature}} only could {{they look for}} consolation in their banishment. But then they speak of a remedy for sorrow, not of a source of joy. No young man should dare to neglect literature. At some period {{of his life he}} will surely need consolation. And he may be certain that should he live to be an old man, there will be none other,--except religion. But for that feeling of self-contentment, which creates happiness--hard work, and hard work alone, can give it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Majesties, I make no {{plea for}} myself, and when I am {{questioned}} before your Inquisition the task will be easy, for I desire to hide nothing, and {{will tell the}} truth, though not from fear or because I shrink from pain. Your Majesties, you <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> these two, who, at least, are good enough Christians from their birth, shall be wed. I would ask you if any spiritual crime, or supposed crime, of mine {{will be allowed to}} work their separation, or to their detriment in any way whatsoever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, lady. Stones cannot speak, {{the spirits}} are silent, {{and we have}} forgotten. Still, I think so, and our fathers <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> but six or eight generations ago many folk lived here, {{though it was not}} they who built these walls. Even fifty years ago there were many, but now the Matabele have killed them, and we are few; to-morrow you will see how few. Come here and look," [...] and he led her through the {{entrance}} of a square cattle kraal which stood close by. Within were tufts of rank grass, and a few bushes, and among these scores of skulls and other bones.|$|E

60|$|Don Fernando now appeared, and {{he joined}} in the {{discourse}} in a manner {{to show that he}} considered himself fully committed to redeem the pledges given by his wife. The historians <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he had been won over by the intercessions of a favorite, though the better opinion would seem to be that deference for Isabella, whose pure earnestness in the cause of virtue often led him from his more selfish policy, lay at the bottom of his compliance. Whatever may have been the motive, however, it is certain that the king never entered into the undertaking with the ardent, zealous endeavors to insure success, which from that moment distinguished the conduct of his royal consort.|$|E
6000|$|But why {{was this}} story of Joseph put into Holy Scripture, and at such length, too? It seems, at first sight, to be simply a family history--the story of {{brothers}} and their father; it seems, at first sight, to teach us nothing concerning our redemption and salvation; it seems, at first sight, not to reveal anything fresh to us concerning God; it seems, at first sight, not to be needed for the general plan of the Bible history. It tells us, of course, how the Israelites first came into Egypt; and that was necessary for us to know. But the Bible might <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> in ten verses. Why has it spent upon the story of Joseph and his brethren, not ten verses, but ten chapters? ...|$|E
6000|$|Realism {{appeared}} in still stranger forms {{at the time}} to which I refer. The community of plan which is observable in each great group of animals was hypostatised into a Platonic idea with the appropriate name of [...] "archetype," [...] and we were told, as a disciple of Philo-Jud√¶us might <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> this realistic figment was [...] "the archetypal light" [...] by which Nature {262} has been guided amidst the [...] "wreck of worlds." [...] So, again, another naturalist, who had no less earned a well-deserved reputation by his contributions to positive knowledge, put forward a theory of the production of living things which, as nearly as the increase of knowledge allowed, was a reproduction of the doctrine inculcated by the Jewish Cabbala.|$|E

2500|$|We are {{unlikely}} to say the second unless someone (perhaps Bob himself) <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Bob is hungry.

60|$|Game {{appeared}} to be scarce. Haught <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> deer, turkey and bear had all gone to feed on the mast (fallen acorns); and if we could locate the mast we would find the game. He said he had once seen a herd of several hundred deer migrating from one section of country to another. Apparently this was to find new feeding grounds.|$|R
60|$|How far the {{conspiracy}} to fall upon the English {{on the frontier}} {{in the summer of}} 1762 was concocted by Pontiac will perhaps never be known. Some historians have contended that he was responsible for it in its entirety, while others <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the real Pontiac conspiracy was confined to the awful uprising which took place just one year later. But be that as it may, it is undoubtedly true that Pontiac hated the English intensely and that it galled him exceedingly to see them pushing further and further to the north and the west. His own lands around the Great Lakes were being invaded, and when his tribe went to the English for redress they got but scant attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of meat we {{have plenty}} with us, Macumazahn, and {{therefore}} you will not hunger on the way. Your horse and everything that is yours shall be brought after you; since were you mounted on that swift beast and minded to escape, how could we catch you with our feet, and did you please to shoot us with your rifle, how could we who have only spears, save ourselves from dying? As for the Opener of Roads, his servants <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he means to sleep all to-day that he may talk with spirits in his dreams, and therefore it is useless for you to wait to bid him farewell. Moreover, the orders of the king are that we should bring you to him at once." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have tried}} the spirits by various test questions, on {{every one of}} which they have failed egregiously. Here, however, the {{aforesaid}} Mary Runnel comes into play. The other spirits <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the veracity of this spirit {{is not to be}} depended upon; and so, whenever it is possible, poor Mary Runnel is thrust forward to bear the odium of every mistake or falsehood. They have avowed themselves responsible for all statements signed by themselves, and have thereby brought themselves into more than one inextricable dilemma; but it is very funny, where a response or a matter of fact has not been thus certified, how invariably Mary Runnel is made to assume the discredit of it, on its turning out to be false. It is the most ingenious arrangement that could possibly have been contrived; and somehow or other, the pranks of this lying spirit give a reality to the conversations which the more respectable ghosts quite fail in imparting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile, thou man, I shame {{not to say}} {{it before}} all these witnesses, I love thee, {{and it seems that}} this--this woman or goddess--loves thee also, and she <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> now, now thou must choose between us once and for ever. She <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> too <b>that</b> if I sinned against Isis, whose {{minister}} be it remembered she declares herself, herself she sinned yet more. For she would have taken thee both from a heavenly mistress and from an earthly bride, and yet snatch that guerdon of immortality which is hers to-day. Therefore if I am evil, she is worse, nor does the flame that burns within the casket whereof Oros spoke shine so very pure and bright.|$|R

[...] This gracious speech went unanswered; Roderick had already wandered across {{to the other side of}} the studio and was revolving about Miss Light. [...] "Ah, he 's gone to look at my beautiful daughter; he is not the first that has had his head turned," [...] Mrs. Light resumed, lowering her voice to a confidential undertone; a favor which, considering the shortness of their acquaintance, Rowland was bound to appreciate.

60|$|I was {{an officer}} of the staff of a Federal brigade. Chickamauga was not my first battle by many, for {{although}} hardly more than a boy in years, I had served at the front {{from the beginning of the}} trouble, and had seen enough of war to give me a fair understanding of it. We knew well enough that there was to be a fight: the fact that we did not want one would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> for Bragg always retired when we wanted to fight and fought when we most desired peace. We had manoeuvred him out of Chattanooga, but had not manoeuvred our entire army into it, and he fell back so sullenly that those of us who followed, keeping him actually in sight, were a good deal more concerned about effecting a junction with the rest of our army than to push the pursuit. By the time that Rosecrans had got his three scattered corps together we were a long way from Chattanooga, with our line of communication with it so exposed that Bragg turned to seize it. Chickamauga was a fight for possession of a road.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{am afraid}} that all the Mahommedan world would agree in {{reciprocating}} that appellation to Dr. Wace himself. I once visited the Hazar Mosque, the great University of Mahommedanism, in Cairo, in ignorance {{of the fact that}} I was unprovided with {352} proper authority. A swarm of angry undergraduates, as I suppose I ought to call them, came buzzing about me and my guide; and if I had known Arabic, I suspect that [...] "dog of an infidel" [...] would have been by no means the most [...] "unpleasant" [...] of the epithets showered upon me, before I could explain and apologise for the mistake. If I had had the pleasure of Dr. Wace's company on that occasion, the undiscriminative followers of the Prophet would, I am afraid, have made no difference between us; not even if they had known that he was the head of an orthodox Christian seminary. And I have not the smallest doubt that even one of the learned mollahs, if his grave courtesy would have permitted him to say anything offensive to men of another mode of belief, would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he wondered we did not find it [...] "very unpleasant" [...] to disbelieve in the Prophet of Islam.|$|E
