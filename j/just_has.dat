25|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1986, <b>JUST</b> <b>has</b> {{been at the}} forefront of institutions of higher learning in the Arab world, it also maintains a high reputation and standard amongst the universities of the Middle East. JUST and the University of Jordan in Amman are considered to be the two premier institutions of higher education for engineering and medicine in the country, although numerous other faculties and specializations are represented as well. The university was described as the best scientific institution in the Kingdom by King Abdullah II during a visit in November '10. As of the 2006/2007 academic year, JUST had 717 faculty members, with 20,000 undergraduate and 1559 graduate students, in contrast to 2,300 students in the 1986/1987 academic year. At the present time, the university comprises 12 faculties and 55 departments providing 52 bachelor's degree and 95 postgraduate programs. JUST comprised 5,415 international students of 61 nationalities in the academic year 2009/2010, rendering it the most cultural-diverse university in Jordan. It was ranked as the top research university in the country, and amongst the top 3% of universities in the Islamic world, according to a study carried out by the Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Center for Islamic Countries (SESRTCIC).|$|E
25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox and story editor Ethan Gross, and was directed by frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson.

There's nothing in it that isn't the best you can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E

[...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone <b>just</b> <b>has</b> a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. Of course, it does all this with scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E.

Rhys charms Erin [...] "into his bed", but he is put out when she calls time on their relationship to focus on her studies. Rhys later learns Erin has turned up late for surgery and during dinner together, he spills wine on Erin's top. When she turns up at the hospital, she smells of alcohol.

Barber explained [...] "Rhys <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to plant the seed of doubt, fake some concern for his colleague, and rumour and innuendo does the rest..."

[...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil.

This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it <b>just</b> <b>has</b> this impact on you, rather {{like being in the}} room itself.

Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E

Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now.

In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive.
