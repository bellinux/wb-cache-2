5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot <b>fall.</b> <b>As</b> a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome {{in this area is}} the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E

Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} can <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> low as , {{which can}} initiate convection {{even in the}} driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

Feeling his family should not go through so much trouble to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E
5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at risk of becoming too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's waters are acidic because of acid rain.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian Scout {{program had}} four stages. During {{the first three}} years, Bánáthy {{advanced}} three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called Turul, after the mythical bird of Hungary. From spring to <b>fall,</b> <b>as</b> weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp. Bánáthy and his troop attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933. Up until this time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|The {{powerful}} Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan {{was severely}} {{defeated by the}} Christian kings at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. Marinid Morocco subsequently went into internal convulsions, too busy for active intervention in Spain, {{clearing the way for}} a renewed attempt by the Castilians on Algeciras and Gibraltar. Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344. Gibraltar, however, would not <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> easily. The Castilans subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349–50. It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century. Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.|$|E

5|$|While Josce {{was absent}} from Ludlow, Gilbert de Lacy {{was able to}} take the castle. Josce laid siege to the castle but was {{unsuccessful}} in his attempt to retake it, and retreated to Lambourn with his military forces. Although the exact date of this event is unknown, it appears to have been some time about 1150 or shortly before. Matilda gave Josce some lands around Lambourn after Ludlow's <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> compensation. Later he was given land in Berkshire by King Henry II (became king in 1154), Matilda's son, as further recompense for the loss of Ludlow. In 1156 Josce held lands in Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Devonshire and Somerset. These holdings included the manor of Lambourn, worth £76 in income per year, as well as the manor of Stanton (now known as Stanton Fitzwarren in Wiltshire) in addition to the lands scattered in other counties.|$|E

Despite the top five athletes all running personal best times, Zersenay was alone at the very front from 10km onwards. He fell four seconds short of the 15km world record, but significantly revised Haile Gebrselassie's four-year-old 20km world mark to 55:21, beating it by almost half a minute. Samuel Wanjiru's half marathon world record was next to <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> Zersenay crossed the line at 58:23 minutes, a clear ten seconds ahead of the previous mark.|$|E

5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five {{of the last six}} wickets to <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second <b>fall</b> <b>as</b> they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero dropped to his knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
