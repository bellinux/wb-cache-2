50|$|Among {{the biggest}} factors <b>depressing</b> <b>demand</b> for {{newsprint}} in North America {{have been the}} decline in newspaper readership among many sectors of the population—particularly young adults—along with increasing competition for advertising business from the Internet and other media. According to the Newspaper Association of America, a United States newspaper trade group, average U.S. daily circulation in 2006 on a typical weekday was 52.3 million (53.2 million on Sundays), compared with 62.5 million in 1986 (58.9 million on Sundays) and 57.0 million in 1996 (60.8 million on Sundays). According to NAA, daily ad revenues (not adjusted for inflation) reached their all-time peak in 2000, and by 2007 had fallen by 13%. Newsprint demand has also been affected by attempts {{on the part of}} newspaper publishers to reduce marginal printing costs through various conservation measures intended to cut newsprint usage.|$|E
5000|$|Trends {{in annual}} {{inflation}} rates mask variations in monthly rates, however. In 1994, for example, the government managed to reduce monthly rates from 21% in January to 4% in August, but rates climbed once again, to 16.4% by December and 18% by January 1995. Instability in Russian monetary policy caused the variations. After tightening {{the flow of}} money early in 1994, the Government loosened its restrictions in response to demands for credits by agriculture, industries in the Far North, and some favored large enterprises. In 1995 the pattern was avoided more successfully by maintaining the tight monetary policy adopted {{early in the year}} and by passing a relatively stringent budget. Thus, the monthly inflation rate held virtually steady below 5% {{in the last quarter of}} the year. For the first half of 1996, the inflation rate was 16.5%. However, experts noted that control of inflation was aided substantially by the failure to pay wages to workers in state enterprises, a policy that kept prices low by <b>depressing</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|E
30|$|Although the “one-size-fits-all” {{approach}} to short-term macroeconomic policies is defective, it has nevertheless persisted for years. In {{the regulation of}} the real estate industry, for example, measures meant to help curb escalating housing prices in first-tier cities were uniformly applied in cities of all different sizes, including many second- and third-tier cities. But many of these cities not only did not need these measures, but in fact they could ill afford them. The imposition of sweeping policies on them is comparable to medicating an entire family when only one member is ill. All local governments in China want to see housing prices rise, because they earn their keep mostly through land leases. Thus, the “one-size-fits-all” approach has effectively deprived many of them of their main source of revenue and is to blame for the fiscal difficulties they have suffered in recent years. To exacerbate the problem, shrinking treasuries undermine the efforts by many local governments to mitigate the negative impact of regulations on the real estate industry. The government in Beijing has included the construction of 36 million units of affordable housing in the 12 th 5 -year economic plan. These building projects are supposed not only to help low-income households meet their housing needs but also to help more than 30 housing-related sectors by boosting demand for their products. This would have been a perfect plan, except for the for the fact that reduced revenue streams have left these projects unaffordable for many local governments, as the progress report of the construction of affordable housing in {{the last year and a}} half demonstrates. In other cities that answered the central government’s call to build affordable housing, officials have experienced difficulties in selling the units and recovering investments. The experience of one second-tier city in North-eastern China illustrates this point. Because of the prohibitively high costs of building affordable housing in the downtown area (which would also involve wide-scale demolition of existing structures), the city government had no choice but to have them built far from downtown. But the intended beneficiaries of these buildings are the very ones who can hardly afford the transportation costs living far from the city center would entail, and so many of them have chosen to opt out of moving into the very houses that were intended to improve their living conditions. Furthermore, eligibility requirements for affordable housing entitlements often set the income threshold too low, thus arbitrarily <b>depressing</b> <b>demand.</b> The “one-size-fits-all” {{approach to}} policy intervention seems to be a contributing factor to all these problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{tax reform}} and the current {{economic}} recovery boosted expenditures by private households (adjusted for price increases) {{in the first half}} of 1994 by a hefty 2. 3 percent. The demand for durable consumer goods picked up very slowly mainly because consumers expect prices to fall at the beginning of 1995 when Austria will join the European Union. Expenditures by Austrian tourists abroad were very lively. This development together with the relatively slow growth in expenditures by foreign tourists in Austria caused retail sales (adjusted for price increases) to expand only half as fast as domestic private consumption. Christmas business is likely to be slightly better than last year. Private consumption tends to stabilize economic activity over the business cycle. During the upswing consumer expenditures rise by less than the increase in income; during the downswing consumer expenditures decrease less than proportionately. After a tax reform it takes about two to three quarters until consumers have adjusted their consumption plans to the new income path. In the first half of 1994, expenditures by private households exceeded last year's level by 2. 3 percent in real terms. This relatively brisk increase was based on strong income gains (tax reform, economic recovery); at the same time a slight increase in the savings ratio of private households was recorded. As a rule, gains in consumer expenditures lag several quarters behind tax relief measures; thus the demand for durable consumer goods, the component in consumption most responsive to income changes, was weaker than {{in the first half of}} 1993 (– 2. 7 percent). Another element <b>depressing</b> <b>demand</b> for consumer durables was the expectation of lower prices in 1995. Given the low average age of the stock of cars, car sales plunged by 8. 2 percent. The demand for furniture and household articles continued to be brisk, a trend that is consistent with the lively construction activity and the trend toward the new emphasis on house and home. In the category of nondurable consumer goods and services, recreational expenditures is the group most responsive to income and price changes. Lower prices abroad resulting from changes in exchange rates, income gains, as well as pent-up demand triggered a travel boom by Austrian tourists; in the first half of 1994, they spent 9. 8 percent more than in the first half of 1993. Retail sales are determined by both the expenditures of Austrians and of foreign visitors in Austria. A rise in expenditures by Austrian consumers abroad implies a loss in purchasing power for retail trade in Austria. The decline in the number of tourists visiting Austria, price reductions in travel arrangements, as well as the weak development in disposable income in Germany limited the expansion of retail sales. Adjusted for price increases, sales were 1. 2 percent higher than during the corresponding period of 1993. During the summer the heat wave depressed retail sales, and it is doubtful whether these losses have been compensated during the rest of the year. All hope rests now on a brisk Christmas business. Prospects for the Christmas business this year are determined by two opposing factors: the pick-up in economic activity as well as the income gains due to the tax reforms should boost sales; the expectation of lower prices in 1995 as well as cheap travel arrangements to foreign destinations are likely to depress sales. In this context, Christmas business is defined as business that exceeds the "normal" volume in December. Model simulations project a modest increase of up to 1 percent in real terms.

30|$|During the 1800 s, {{the agrarian}} economy contributed {{the most to}} US GDP {{and much of the}} world’s output.

The decline was especially severe between 1929 and 1932 —agricultural incomes decreased by 50 %. One important implication of this secular decline is the shedding of agricultural employment that led to massive joblessness, since new sectors and economic activities failed to fully utilize the growing pool of the unemployed. In theory, the purchasing power of urban wages increased, but this expansionary effect was stifled by the drastic contraction of agricultural demand for urban commodities (Gatti et al. 2012).

One reason for this is that, following the reasoning of Ronald Coase (1946), it is difficult for any company with decreasing average costs to recover full costs in a highly competitive market. One way of approaching the problem is to establish quasi-monopoly power and airlines have done this through such things as frequent flyer programs and hub-and-spoke operations. Other airlines, notably charter carriers, have sought to adjust capacity and services to meet an anticipated cash flow. In practice, many have used a combination of measures with mixed success.

40|$|The current global {{economic}} crisis concerns {{the way in}} which contemporary capitalism has turned to financialisation as a double cure for both a falling rate of profit and a deficiency of demand. Although this turning is by no means unprecedented, policies of financialisation have <b>depressed</b> <b>demand</b> (in part {{as a result of the}} long-term stagnation of average wages) while at the same time not proving adequate to restore profits and growth. This paper argues that the current crisis is less the ‘normal’ one that has to do with a constitutive need to balance growth of abstract wealth with demand for concrete commodities. Rather, it marks a meta-crisis of capitalism that is to do with the difficulties of sustaining abstract growth as such. This meta-crisis is the tendency at once to abstract from the real economy of productive activities and to reduce everything to its bare materiality. By contrast with a market economy that binds material value to symbolic meaning, a capitalist economy tends to separate matter from symbol and reduce materiality to calculable numbers representing ‘wealth’. Such a conception of wealth rests on the aggregation of abstract numbers that cuts out all the relational goods and the ‘commons’ on which shared prosperity depends...|$|R
