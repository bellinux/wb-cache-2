5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence. The influx of former refugees from Uganda and elsewhere during the late 20th century has created a linguistic divide between the English-speaking population and the French-speaking remainder of the country. <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> English, and French are all official languages. <b>Kinyarwanda</b> {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya and Tanzania. In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools. Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Amashi, a language closely related to <b>Kinyarwanda.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rwanda women's {{national}} football team represents Rwanda in women's association football and {{is controlled by}} the Fédération Rwandaise de Football Association. It had to date been scheduled to compete in one major tournament, the inaugural Women's Challenge Cup held in Zanzibar in October 2007, but the event was ultimately canceled. It has finally debuted in February 2014 against Kenya. Like their male counterpart, the team is nicknamed The She-Amavubi (<b>Kinyarwanda</b> for The She-Wasps). It has never qualified for an African Championship finals or a World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a <b>Kinyarwanda</b> word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are state-run, {{and the majority of}} newspapers are owned by the government. Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda. , the state-run Radio Rwanda is the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country. Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set. The government rolled out digital television in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era. The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. Nonetheless, publications in <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> English, and French critical of the government are widely available in Kigali. Restrictions were increased {{in the run-up to the}} Rwandan presidential election of 2010, with two independent newspapers, Umuseso and Umuvugizi, being suspended for six months by the High Media Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E

25|$|The name Gacaca {{is derived}} from the <b>Kinyarwanda</b> word umucaca meaning “a plant so soft to sit on that people prefer to gather on it”. Originally, Gacaca gatherings were meant to restore order and harmony within {{communities}} by acknowledging wrongs and having justice restored to those who were victims.|$|E
25|$|Hutus speak Rwanda-Rundi {{as their}} native tongue, {{which is a}} member of the Bantu {{subgroup}} of the Niger–Congo language family. Rwanda-Rundi is subdivided into the <b>Kinyarwanda</b> and Kirundi dialects, which have been standardized as official languages of Rwanda and Burundi respectively. It is also spoken as a mother tongue by the Tutsi and Twa.|$|E
25|$|Tutsis speak Rwanda-Rundi {{as their}} native language. It {{is a member}} of the Bantu {{subgroup}} of the Niger–Congo family. Rwanda-Rundi is subdivided into the <b>Kinyarwanda</b> and Kirundi dialects, which have been standardized as official languages of Burundi and Rwanda. It is also spoken as a mother tongue by the Hutu and Twa. Additionally, many Tutsis speak French, the third official language of Rwanda and Burundi, as a lingua franca. The Hima speak the same language, but call their language Hima.|$|E
25|$|English is {{designated}} as the official language of the EAC, with Kiswahili, often known as Swahili, designated for development as the lingua franca of the community. Within the EAC, there are two countries whose official language is French: Rwanda and Burundi. Numerous local languages are also spoken: for example, there are 56 local languages spoken in Uganda and 42 local languages in Kenya. <b>Kinyarwanda</b> is spoken in Rwanda and Uganda. In Kenya and Uganda, the medium of instruction in all schools is English.|$|E

[...] "In January , tensions escalated after {{human rights abuses}} were committed by soldiers of the FARDC 5th integrated brigade against <b>Kinyarwanda</b> speakers in Rutshuru territory, in command the colonel Thierry Nindaga. Insurgents belonging to the Laurent Nkunda militia, with elements of the 83rd brigade, attacked the FARDC 5th integrated brigade. They subsequently took over Rwindi and Kibrizi, prompting the withdrawal of FARDC from Rutshuru to Kanyabayonga. On 21 January, MONUC launched operations and successfully cleared Rwindi and Kibrizi of rebel elements." [...] Brigade now at Kananga, Kasai-Occidental.

500|$|When Kabila {{took power}} in 1997, {{the country was}} renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo and so {{the name of the}} {{national}} army changed once again, to the Forces armées congolaises (FAC). Tanzania sent six hundred military advisors to train Kabila's new army in May 1997. Command over the armed forces in {{the first few months of}} Kabila's rule was vague. Gérard Prunier writes that 'there was no minister of defence, no known chief of staff, and no ranks; all officers were Cuban-style 'commanders' called 'Ignace', 'Bosco', Jonathan', or 'James', who occupied connecting suites at the Intercontinental Hotel and had presidential list cell-phone numbers. None spoke French or Lingala, but all spoke <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> Swahili, and, quite often, English.' On being asked by Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman what was the actual army command structure apart from himself, Kabila answered 'We are not going to expose ourselves and risk being destroyed by showing ourselves openly... We are careful so that the true masters of the army are not known. It is strategic. Please, let us drop the matter.' Kabila's new Forces armées congolaises were riven with internal tensions. The new FAC had Banyamulenge fighters from South Kivu, kadogo child soldiers from various eastern tribes, such as Thierry Nindaga, Safari Rwekoze, etc... Lunda Katangese Tigers of the former FNLC, and former FAZ personnel. Mixing these disparate and formerly warring elements together led to mutuny. On 23 February 1998, a mostly Banyamulenge unit mutiniued at Bukavu after its officers tried to disperse the soldiers into different units spread all around the Congo. By mid-1998, formations on the outbreak of the Second Congo War included the Tanzanian-supported 50th Brigade, headquartered at Camp Kokolo in Kinshasa, and the 10th Brigade — one of the best and largest units in the army — stationed in Goma, as well as the 12th Brigade in Bukavu. The declaration of the 10th Brigade's commander, former DSP officer Jean-Pierre Ondekane, on 2 August 1998 that he no longer recognised Kabila as the state's president was one of the factors in the beginning of the Second Congo War.|$|E

The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the {{explorer}} John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River.|$|E
2500|$|Lemarchand {{notes that}} the group {{represents}} [...] "a rather unique case of ethnogenesis." [...] The Banyamulenge of South Kivu are culturally and socially distinct from the Tutsis of North Kivu and the Tutsis who fled to South Kivu in the 1959–1962 Rwandan revolution. [...] Most Banyamulenge speak <b>Kinyarwanda,</b> {{and those that do}} speak it with a dialect different from other Tutsi groups. The ambiguous political and social position of the Banyamulenge has been a point of contention in the province, leading to the Banyamulenge playing {{a key role in the}} run-up to the First Congo War in 1996–7 and Second Congo War of 1998–2003.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, {{the closure}} of the Albanian, Macedonian, Portuguese for Africa, Serbian, and English for the Caribbean {{services}} was announced. [...] This reflected the financial situation the Corporation faced following transfer of responsibility for the Service from the Foreign Office, so that it would in future have been funded from within licence fee income. The Russian, Ukrainian, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Azeri, and Spanish for Cuba services ceased radio broadcasting, and the Hindi, Indonesian, Kyrgyz, Nepali, Swahili, <b>Kinyarwanda</b> and Kirundi services ceased shortwave transmissions. The British government announced that the three Balkan countries had wide access to international information, and so broadcasts in the local languages had become unnecessary. 650 jobs went as part of the 16% budget cut.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1990, {{over a dozen}} {{newspapers}} were launched, in either <b>Kinyarwanda</b> or French methodically exploited ethnic tensions. In December 1990, the newspaper Kangura printed the Hutu Ten Commandments of which four dealt specifically with women. On 29 January 1992, Kangura accused Tutsi women of having a monopoly on employment in both {{the private and public}} sectors, saying that they would hire their [...] "Tutsi sisters {{on the basis of their}} thin noses" [...] (a stereotypical 'Tutsi feature'). Kangura requested that all Hutu be vigilant against the Tutsi, who they called Inyenzi (cockroaches), as well as those considered accomplices. In an interview with Human Rights Watch one Hutu woman stated, [...] "According to the propaganda, the Tutsi were hiding the enemy. And their beautiful women were being used to do it. So, everybody knew what that meant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gacaca {{court system}} faced many controversies and challenges; they {{were accused of}} being puppets of the RPF-dominated government. The judges (known as Inyangamugayo, which means [...] "those who detest dishonesty" [...] in <b>Kinyarwanda)</b> who preside over the {{genocide}} trials were elected by the public. After election, the judges received training, but there was concern that the training was not adequate for serious legal questions or complex proceedings. Furthermore, many judges resigned after facing accusations of participating in the genocide; 27.1% of them were so accused. There was also a lack of defense counsel and protections for the accused, who were {{denied the right to}} appeal to ordinary courts. Most trials were open to the public, but there were issues with witness intimidation. The Gacaca courts did not try those responsible for massacres of Hutu civilians committed by members of the RPF, which controlled the Gacaca Court system.|$|E
2500|$|Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines {{broadcast}} radio shows suggesting {{the end to}} toleration of the Tutsi, repeating the Hutu Ten Commandments, and building support for the Hutu Power ideology. Two main voices of RTLM were announcers Valérie Bemeriki and Georges Ruggiu. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments {{was an attempt to}} mobilize the population to help eradicate the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the Akazu. Politician Léon Mugesera gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, [...] "Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck...Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!" [...] The radio programs frequently referred to the Tutsi as inyenzi, a <b>Kinyarwanda</b> word meaning 'cockroach', though the term had also been a self-description by members of the Rwanda Patriotic Front.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the genocide, he was a [...] "well-known {{composer}} and singer of popular music and director of the performance group Irindiro Ballet." [...] His songs were described as having [...] "elliptical lyrics and catchy tunes", mixing English, French and <b>Kinyarwanda</b> and combining rap-style texts with traditional folk song melodies. His first cassette, released in 1990, was of traditional wedding songs. He was additionally a civil servant of the Ministry of Youth and Sport {{and a member of the}} MRND party. Some of his songs directed against the Tutsi were played on Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines to incite killings. He left the country a few days before the beginning of the genocide, but returned later in June. It is a matter of debate whether and to what extent he participated in the genocide as such, but according to the ruling of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was associated with the extremist Interahamwe militia and publicly urged Hutus to exterminate all Tutsis in June 1994. After the RPF takeover, he fled the country. His songs are banned in Rwanda since 1994.|$|E
