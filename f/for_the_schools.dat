5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> affiliated with the church.|$|E

25|$|Carolina Coliseum, {{which opened}} in 1968, is a 12,401-seat {{facility}} which initially served {{as the home of}} the USC Gamecocks' basketball teams. The arena could be easily adapted to serve other entertainment purposes, including concerts, car shows, circuses, ice shows, and other popular events. The versatility and quality of the coliseum at one time allowed the university to use the facility for performing arts events such as the Boston Pops, Chicago Symphony, Feld Ballet, and other performances by important artists. An acoustical shell and a state-of-the-art lighting system assisted the coliseum in presenting such activities. The coliseum was the home of the Columbia Inferno, an ECHL team.

25|$|In Isleta, Lummis {{divorced}} {{his first}} wife and married Eva Douglas, {{who lived in the}} village and was the sister-in-law of an English trader. Somehow he convinced Eva to stay with Dorothea in Los Angeles until the divorce went through. In the meantime, Lummis became entangled in fights with the U.S. government agents over Indian education. In this period, the government was pushing assimilation and had established Indian boarding schools. It charged its agents with recruiting Native American children <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> where they were usually forced to give up traditional clothing and hair styles, and prevented from speaking their own languages or using their own customs. They were often prohibited from returning home during holidays or vacation periods, or their families were too poor to afford such travel. Lummis persuaded the government to allow 36 children from the Albuquerque Indian School to return to their homes.|$|E
25|$|Aware of the RAF's {{urgent need}} for {{additional}} training facilities, the United States offered the British over 500 aircraft {{for use in the}} training of British pilots in the United States. General Hap Arnold also arranged for civilian contractors to set up schools exclusively for training British pilots. The schools would accept 50 RAF students every 5 weeks for a 20-week course in order to produce 3,000 pilots a year. Known as the British Flying Training School Program, it was unique among the programs the Air Corps offered to Allied nations inasmuch as the British dealt directly with the contractors and completely controlled all aspects of the flying training process. Basically, the Air Corps just helped the RAF and the contractors select the sites <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> and then supervised their construction. The schools were located at Mesa, Arizona; Lancaster, California; Clewiston, Florida; Miami and Ponca City, Oklahoma; Terrell, Texas; and, briefly, Sweetwater, Texas.|$|E
25|$|Malaka chose Java island as the {{starting}} point of his struggle, considering that there were many figures who had the same view as him. He arrived in Batavia when his old teacher, Horensma, offered him a job as a teacher; however, Malaka rejected it. Malaka told that he wanted to establish a school; Horensma accepted the reason and supported him. Malaka arrived at Yogyakarta in early March 1921 and stayed at a house belonging to Sutopo, a former leader of Budi Utomo. There he wrote a proposal about grammar school. He participated in Sarekat Islam's 5th congress and met H.O.S. Tjokroaminoto, Agus Salim, Darsono, and Semaun. The congress discussed the topic of double membership. Agus Salim and Abdul Muis forbade it, while Semaun and Darsono were PKI members. Malaka offered a solution that excluded PKI because both organizations had the same vision; however, the prohibition was applied in the end. Sarekat Islam was split as a result, forming SI Putih (White SI), led by Tjokroaminoto, and SI Merah (Red SI), led by Semaun and based in Semarang. After the congress Malaka was asked by Semaun to go to Semarang to join PKI. He went to Semarang and then accepted it. Arriving in Semarang, Malaka became sick. A month later, he had returned to health and participated in a meeting with fellow SI Semarang members. The meeting concluded that a rival to government schools was needed. The school, named Sekolah Sarekat Islam (which was later better known as Sekolah Tan Malaka, and spread to Bandung and Ternate), opened to enrollment on 21 June 1921, the day after the meeting. As a guidebook <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> Malaka wrote SI Semarang dan Onderwijs. In June 1921 Malaka became the chairman of Serikat Pegawai Pertjitakan (Printing Workers Association) and served as the vice chairman and treasurer of Serikat Pegawai Pelikan Hindia (SPPH or Indies Oils Workers Association). Between May and August his first book, Sovjet atau Parlemen? (Soviet or Parliament?), was serialized in PKI's journal Soeara Ra'jat; his other works, including articles, were published in the journal and PKI's newspaper Sinar Hindia. In June {{he was one of the}} leaders of Revolutionaire Vakcentrale and in August he was elected to the editorial board of SPPH's journal Soeara Tambang. Malaka then replaced Semaun, who left the Dutch East Indies in October, as the chairman of PKI after a congress on 24–25 December 1921 in Semarang. Whilst Semaun was more cautious, Malaka was more radical. Malaka also maintained a good relationship with Sarekat Islam. The Dutch East Indies' government felt threatened and arrested Malaka on 13 February 1922 in Bandung when he visited the branch school. He was first exiled to Kupang; however, he wanted to be exiled to the Netherlands. He left the Dutch East Indies in March and arrived in the Netherlands on 1 May.|$|E

500|$|In 1819 the Florida Territory was ceded to the United States by Spain as {{an element}} of the Adams–Onís Treaty. The Territory was {{conventionally}} split by the Appalachicola or later the Suwannee rivers into East and West areas.

The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the basic system by providing for land allocated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools.</b> In 1845 Florida became the 27th State of the United States, which permitted the resources and intent of the 1823 Congress regarding education in Florida to be implemented.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, {{the boys}} were {{evacuated}} to the seaside town of Cleveleys, Lancashire, where they shared accommodation with a primary school. Chetham's was damaged by an explosion in December 1940, {{when most of the}} windows were shattered and the roof set alight. The boys relocated to Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, in 1943, although thirteen boys attending grammar school moved to Buxton College. By 1944 the governors believed {{that it would not be}} appropriate for the school to return to Manchester, and it was proposed the site become a religious education centre. However, after years of discussion, it was decided to return the school to Manchester. The Education Act 1944, which stipulated that schools should be classified as primary or secondary, complicated matters, since Chetham's went across the middle. [...] It was decided in 1950 that Chetham's should become a grammar school, and this change took place two years later. In 1950, Chetham's amalgamated with Nicholls' Hospital School, a similar school based in Ardwick which had been established in 1863. While it could take up to 100 boys, by the end of the war there were only 22 and it was considered beneficial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> to merge.|$|E
500|$|A post-Norman Conquest tradition, {{originating}} with Goscelin, gives Deusdedit's original name as Frithona, {{possibly a}} corruption of Frithuwine. He was consecrated by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on 26 March or perhaps 12March 655. He was the sixth archbishop after {{the arrival of}} the Gregorian missionaries, and the first to be a native of the island of Great Britain rather than an Italian, having been born a West Saxon. One reason for the long period between the Christianization of the Kentish kingdom from Anglo-Saxon paganism in about 600 and the appointment of the first native archbishop may have been the need <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> established by the Gregorian missionaries to educate the natives to a sufficiently high standard for them to take ecclesiastical office. Deusdedit probably owed his appointment to the see of Canterbury to a collaboration between Eorcenberht of Kent and Cenwalh of Wessex. The name Deusdedit means [...] "God has given" [...] in Latin, and had been the name of a recent pope, Deusdedit, in office from 615 to 618; it was the practice of many of the early medieval Saxon bishops to take an adopted name, often from recent papal names. It is unclear when Deusdedit adopted his new name, although the historian Richard Sharpe considers it likely to have been when he was consecrated as an archbishop, rather than when he entered religious life.|$|E
