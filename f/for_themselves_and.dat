Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} panel of this {{sequence}} Michelangelo combines two contrasting scenes into one panel, that of Adam and Eve taking fru{{it from the}} forbidden tree, Eve trustingly taking it from {{the hand of the}} Serpent and Adam eagerly picking it for himself; and their banishment from the Garden of Eden, where they have lived in the company of God, to the world outside where they have to fend <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> experience death.|$|E

In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In {{promoting}} Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E
5|$|Already under Caliph al-Mu'tasim, senior Turkish leaders began being {{appointed}} as governors of provinces of the Caliphate {{as a form}} of appanage. Thereby they secured immediate access to the province's tax revenue <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> their troops, bypassing the civilian bureaucracy. The Turkish generals usually remained close to the centre of power in Samarra, sending deputies to govern in their name. Thus when al-Mu'tazz gave Bakbak charge of Egypt in 868, Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor. Ahmad ibn Tulun entered Egypt on 27 August 868, and the Egyptian capital, Fustat, on 15 September.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E

5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> leaving Ceolwulf with the west. The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf {{defeated}} and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who can {{communicate}} with demons using a computer program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the movie, Elsa throws a {{birthday}} for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> their horses.|$|E
5|$|The Sonderkommado were housed {{separately}} from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their {{quality of life}} was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which Sonderkommandos were sometimes able to steal <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> to trade on Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the Sonderkommando numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many Sonderkommandos committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; {{those who did not}} generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new Sonderkommando units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E

5|$|Thinly populated, {{far from}} the colonial capital of Rio de Janeiro (which {{exercised}} little actual control), Rio Grande do Sul was often the target of invasions from its neighboring Hispanic-American colony, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina). Because the captaincy had to be self-sufficient, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul led lives as merchants, farmers or ranchers, while often also serving as soldiers or militiamen. Owners of large landholdings such as Marques de Sousa's father and grandfather provided food, equipment and protection <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Marques de Sousa grew up in that hostile environment, and from {{a very young age}} he listened to war stories recounting the exploits of his relatives against Hispanic-American invaders.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator.

Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry's deities {{are adopted}} from the pre-Christian belief systems {{found in the}} various {{societies}} of Germanic Europe; they include divinities like Týr, Odin, Thor, Frigg and Freyja from Scandinavian sources, Wōden, Thunor and Ēostre from Anglo-Saxon sources, and figures such as Nehalennia from continental sources. Some practitioners adopt the belief, taken from Norse mythology, {{that there are two}} sets of deities, the Æsir and the Vanir. Certain practitioners blend the different regions and times together, for instance using a mix of Old English and Old Norse names for the deities, while others keep them separate and only venerate deities from a particular region. Some groups focus their veneration on a particular deity; for instance, the Brotherhood of Wolves, a Czech Heathen group, center their worship on the deity Fenrir. Similarly, many practitioners in the U.S. adopt a particular patron deity <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> describe themselves as that entity's devotee using terms such as Thorsman or Odinsman.|$|E
