500|$|Physicist Kevin Grazier posited in a 2006 essay the {{composition}} and problems associated with a Halo installation. The complete Halos seen in Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 orbit gas giants similar to Jupiter, though much larger; the bodies exhibit characteristics of both a <b>jovian</b> <b>planet</b> and a small star. In each system, there are five points where a body of negligible mass would remain stationary to the two much larger bodies in the system, the gas giant and its moon. These areas, known as Lagrange points, are classified by stability; while bodies at 60° angles to the gas giant would remain in the same location relative to the other objects in the system, the other three Lagrange points are meta-stable, having the tendency to be unstable in one direction. As the Halos are located at point , the installations must actively correct its orbit. The apparent gravity of the Halo installations is close to Earth normal. A Halo would have to spin with a tangental speed of [...] per second to match Earth's gravity, translating to 19.25 rotations in a day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{requirement}} {{for a system}} to have a <b>Jovian</b> <b>planet</b> as protector (Rare Earth equation factor [...] ) has been challenged and this has a bearing {{on the number of}} proposed extinction events (Rare Earth equation factor [...] ). Kasting's 2001 review of Rare Earth questions whether a Jupiter protector has any bearing on the frequency of complex life. Computer modelling including the 2005 Nice model and 2007 Nice 2 model yield inconclusive results in relation to Jupiter's gravitational influence and impacts on the inner planets. A study by Horner and Jones (2008) using computer simulation found that while the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear, Jupiter has caused more impacts on Earth than it has prevented. Lexell's Comet, a 1770 near miss that passed closer to Earth than any other comet in recorded history, was known to be caused by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Grazier (2017) claims that the idea of Jupiter as a shield is a misinterpretation of a 1996 study by George Wetherill, and using computer models Grazier was able to demonstrate that Saturn protects Earth from more asteroids and comets than does Jupiter.|$|E

Thus, although the <b>Jovian</b> <b>planets</b> may have accreted carbon and nitrogen from the solar nebula mainly {{in the form of}} CO and N 2, these species were then reprocessed within the circumplanetary nebulae to form mainly CH 4 and NH 3.

40|$|Traditional thermal {{evolution}} {{models of}} giant planets employ arbitrary initial conditions selected more for computational expediency than physical accuracy. Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving planet, {{this approach is}} valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To explore the evolution at young ages of <b>jovian</b> mass <b>planets</b> we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. We find that young <b>jovian</b> <b>planets</b> are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore the time interval during which the young jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1 M_J) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10 M_J planets {{can take up to}} 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct, then young <b>jovian</b> <b>planets</b> are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed. These results have important consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young <b>jovian</b> <b>planets</b> based on observed luminosities.

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} planets poses an {{interesting}} question: when first planets are formed in galaxies. We investigate {{this problem by}} adopting a theoretical model developed for understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets. Our model is constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core accretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly relates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We statistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) {{as well as the}} orbital radius () within which gas accretion becomes efficient enough to form <b>Jovian</b> <b>planets.</b> The three characteristic exoplanetary populations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around 1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the PFFs {{as well as for the}} three different populations as a function of metallicity (- 2 ≤[Fe/H]≤ - 0. 6). We show that the total PFFs increase steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core accretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the population of the low-mass planets dominates over the <b>Jovian</b> <b>planets.</b> The <b>Jovian</b> <b>planets</b> contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]- 1. We find that the hot Jupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the radially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more effective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores. The PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around [Fe/H]- 0. 7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming <b>Jovian</b> <b>planets</b> is [Fe/H]- 1. 2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets. The comparison intrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
