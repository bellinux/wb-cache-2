500|$|... "The {{video is}} set in Barcelona at the Olympic Diving site. I lie down for the whole video, which I thought was a very cunning plan. But then I ended up having to sing {{directly}} into the camera when the sun was right next it, so tears were streaming <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face!</b> Videos always have a painful moment. It's either too hot or it's too cold or there's always something. That's part of the fun, I guess" ...|$|E
500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, [...] "with blood and sweat rolling <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, forgive!" [...] I pleaded. And getting {{no answer}} I put up {{my hands to}} take hers. [...] "Mother!" [...] I cried, and the tears were {{streaming}} <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Big {{with this}} resolve, I sat <b>down</b> with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{to the fire}} and {{my back to the}} palm-tree, and--fell sound asleep instantly! ...|$|R
60|$|More {{than once}} I fell headlong <b>down,</b> {{scratching}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and {{hands with the}} brambles; but each time I was on my feet immediately, scarcely conscious of the pain in my wild desire to keep near my mother.|$|R
6000|$|Oh! narrow, narrow was the space, Oriana. [...] Loud, loud rung out the bugle's brays, Oriana. [...] Oh! deathful stabs were dealt apace, [...] The battle deepen'd in its place, Oriana; [...] But I was <b>down</b> upon <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> Oriana.|$|R
6000|$|... "Later.--I {{write with}} some difficulty, because the blood will run <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and make {{patterns}} on the paper. Blood is a very beautiful thing; {{that is why it}} is concealed. If you ask why blood runs <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I can only reply that I was kicked by a horse. If you ask me what horse, I can reply with some pride that it was a war-horse. If you ask me how a war-horse came on the scene in our simple pedestrian warfare, I am reduced to the necessity, so painful to a special correspondent, of recounting my experiences.|$|E
60|$|A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and me, and {{her figure}} {{seemed to move}} in it for an instant. Then I felt the burning tears run <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and it was steady again.|$|E
60|$|I laughed {{loudly and}} long. And behold! even as I laughed the keen point of things {{accomplished}} stabbed my mirth, and I was weeping, weeping aloud, convulsed with weeping, {{and the tears}} were pouring <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly, Harold," [...] she retorted. [...] "You have {{kissed me}} so much now that my hair is all <b>down,</b> and <b>my</b> <b>face</b> must be a sight. Lips are what you are {{supposed}} to kiss with--you don't have to kiss with your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|They both {{staggered}} backwards. I fancy {{they thought}} I was a spirit, with the moonlight streaming <b>down</b> upon <b>my</b> pale <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my {{soul and}} my father's soul, in you go!" [...] I said, and, seizing {{him by the}} shoulders, I crammed {{his head into the}} mouth of the burrow, kicked the rest of him in, and, sitting <b>down,</b> covered <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with <b>my</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|Perspiration was {{streaming}} <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{and from}} my hands, and in my desire for moisture I scraped it from my cheek, finding it hot and salty, causing soreness of the tongue and a certain nausea of the stomach.|$|E
60|$|I {{have another}} {{confession}} {{to make that}} will appear singular. When she said these words, something rose in my throat; and the stars I looked away at, seemed to break into sparkles that fell <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and burnt it.|$|E
6000|$|Man. 'Tis taught already;--many a {{night on}} the earth, [...] On the bare ground, have I bowed <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> [...] And strewed my head with ashes; I have known [...] The fulness of humiliation--for [...] 40 [...] I sunk before my vain despair, and knelt [...] To my own desolation.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stood up}} with my two hands in his, and as he looked <b>down</b> into <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I am afraid I was {{blushing}} very much, he said, [...] "Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and goodbye." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a little}} while Percy held me {{strained}} to his heart, his tears rained <b>down</b> upon <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> his lips pressed mine again and again, then one long, long kiss--I felt it was the last; then he gave me to Polly, who was standing near. I heard the door close behind him, {{and for a long}} time I heard no other sound. I had fainted.|$|R
6000|$|... "The second heap {{of stones}} has done this, baas," [...] said Hans faintly, {{and this time}} I did not even look him. I only sat <b>down</b> and buried <b>my</b> <b>face</b> in <b>my</b> hands. One more such miss, and then-- ...|$|R
60|$|Screened as we {{were from}} the lightest breath of wind, it was cruelly hot in that hiding-place. Tiny streams of {{perspiration}} ran <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> wetting the leaves beneath my head, and I chewed them in the vain hope that the suspicion of moisture might serve to quench my thirst.|$|E
6000|$|The punkah-coolies {{had gone}} to sleep. Two {{kerosene}} lamps were blazing in the office, and the perspiration poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and splashed on the blotter as I leaned forward. Carnehan was shivering, and I feared that his mind might go. I wiped my face, took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands, and said:--"What happened after that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By asking questions, {{and saying}} wild, {{meaningless}} things while I sat there watching the setting sun. It troubled me and spoiled my pleasure; but I will forgive you, Smith, because I love you. Do you not think I love you enough? You are very dear to me--dearer every day." [...] And drawing <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> she kissed my lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless {{and reward}} you!" [...] he said, and drew me toward him quickly and kissed my forehead. I was quite overcome, and sank <b>down</b> and hid <b>my</b> <b>face</b> on the table. When I {{looked up again}} he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took it in}} his, {{holding me}} lightly with his arm, and looking <b>down</b> into <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with the same genuine {{freshness}} and faithfulness of manner--the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment--said, [...] "You have wrought changes in me, little woman, since the winter day in the stage-coach. First and last you have done me a world of good since that time." ...|$|R
60|$|The sun {{had burned}} for some {{hours in the}} heavens, when {{bleeding}} with thorns and on fire with nettles and stinking mayweed, I dragged myself out of the undergrowth into a low-lying corner of the desolate garden. Near by lay {{a pool of water}} under an old ruinous wall, swept by the foliage of an ash. On a flat, shelving stone at its brink I knelt <b>down,</b> bathed <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and drank.|$|R
6000|$|The punka-coolies {{had gone}} to sleep. Two {{kerosene}} lamps were blazing in the office, and the perspiration poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and splashed on the blotter as I leaned forward. Carnehan was shivering, and I feared that his mind might go. I wiped my face, took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands, and said, [...] "What happened after that?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Captain turned slowly, {{and faced}} {{me with his}} bloody sword in his hand. I can't tell you how he looked; I {{can only say that}} the sight of him turned me faint with terror. I was at Waterloo--I am no coward. But I tell you the cold sweat poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> like water. I should have dropped if I had not held by the branch of a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The big dhrops ran <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> for I was wake wid {{the liquor}} an' {{had not the}} full av my wits about me. I laid shtill an' heard thim workin' {{themselves}} up to swear my life by tellin' tales av ivry time I had put my mark on wan or another; an' my faith, they was few that was not so dishtinguished. 'Twas all in the way av fair fight, though, for niver did I raise my hand excipt whin they had provoked me to ut.|$|E
60|$|Not {{having a}} veil to put <b>down</b> over <b>my</b> own <b>face,</b> I stooped {{and picked up}} the newspaper. Her devilish {{determination}} quite upset me for the moment. I actually had to steady myself before I could speak to her again.|$|R
60|$|All {{other details}} were, however, most satisfactory; {{and at the}} window {{commanding}} the road that leads through the valley towards the distant world I settled <b>down</b> to <b>face</b> <b>my</b> work.|$|R
60|$|In {{about a month}} I {{was ready}} to take leave. The Emperor of Blefuscu, with the Empress and the royal family, {{came out of the}} palace; and I lay <b>down</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to kiss their hands, which they graciously gave me. His Majesty {{presented}} me with fifty purses of sprugs (their greatest gold coin) and his picture at full length, which I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. Many other ceremonies took place at my departure.|$|R
60|$|The music ceased, {{the accompaniment}} died away; but Mr. Rochester stood {{immobile}} yet--a little darker night in that much deeper. When I turned, Jane {{was gone from}} the room. I sat <b>down,</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> towards the still candles, as one who is awake, yet dreams on. The faint scent of the earth through the open window; the heavy, sombre furniture; the daintiness and the alertness in the many flowers and few womanly gew-gaws: these too I shall remember in a tranquillity that cannot change.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} Sophy was round my neck, {{as well as}} the child, and her husband was a-wringing my hand with his face hid, and we all had to shake {{ourselves}} together before we could get over it. And when we did begin to get over it, and I saw the pretty child a-talking, pleased and quick and eager and busy, to her mother, in the signs that I had first taught her mother, the happy and yet pitying tears fell rolling <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The big dhrops ran <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> for I was wake wid {{the liquor}} an' {{had not the}} full av my wits about me. I laid shtill an' heard thim workin' {{themselves}} up to swear my life by tellin' tales av ivry time I had put my mark on wan or another; an' my faith, they was few that was not so dishtinguished. 'Twas all in the way av fair fight, though, for niver did I raise my hand excipt whin they had provoked me to ut.|$|E
6000|$|When I had {{finished}} Marjorie {{clapped her hands}} and exclaimed with delight, but Mariposilla said nothing. She was silently eloquent for several moments, until, suddenly remembering that she ought to acknowledge genius, she kissed me gently upon the cheek, much as she would have kissed the wooden image of the Virgin that stood in the Doña Maria's bedroom. Looking <b>down</b> into <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with her great, beautiful eyes, she said, almost reverently: [...] "The Señora knows much; she is a great and wise Americana; I love her with great love." ...|$|R
5000|$|The whole {{inspiration}} {{came from}} the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it. 'Oh, let the sun beat <b>down</b> upon <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> stars to fill my dreams …' It's one of my favourites … that, 'All My Love' and 'In the Light' and two or three others really were the finest moments. But 'Kashmir' in particular. It was so positive, lyrically.|$|R
60|$|In about a month, {{when all}} was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s commands, {{and to take}} my leave. The emperor and royal family {{came out of the}} palace; I lay <b>down</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to kiss his hand, which he very graciously gave me: so did the empress and young princes of the blood. His majesty {{presented}} me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs a-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at this time.|$|R
