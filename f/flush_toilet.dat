5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first <b>flush</b> <b>toilet.</b> He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of {{urbanisation}} and industrial prosperity, that the <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> became a widely used and marketed invention.

25|$|Although a {{precursor}} to the <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> system which is widely used nowadays was designed in 1596 by John Harington, such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. With {{the onset of the}} industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer.

25|$|In {{regards to}} housing, a 1961 census {{revealed}} {{significant differences in}} the living conditions of Māori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-Māori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8% had a bath or shower, 94.1% a hot water service, 88.7% a <b>flush</b> <b>toilet,</b> 81.6% a refrigerator, and 78.6% an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) Māori private dwellings that same year, 76.8% had a bath or shower, 68.9% a hot water service, 55.8% a refrigerator, 54.1% a <b>flush</b> <b>toilet,</b> and 47% an electric washing machine.|$|E
25|$|Since 1994, {{there is}} a {{significant}} move towards using less water for flushing flush toilets. This has resulted in the emergence of low <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> designs and local or national standards on water consumption for flushing. In addition, some people modify their existing high <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> to use less water by placing a brick or water bottle into the toilet's water tank. Other modifications are often done on the water system itself (such as by using greywater), or a system that pollutes the water less; hence more efficient use of the water is accomplished.|$|E
25|$|A <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> is {{different}} from a urinal, {{which is designed to}} handle only liquid waste; or from a bidet, which can be used for personal cleansing after toilet use.|$|E

25|$|Compared to a <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> being flushed without closing its lid, a UDDT {{would have}} a lower risk of Clostridium difficile {{spreading}} via aerosolization, as it does not involve turbulent water.|$|E
25|$|During normal use, a UDDT {{is just as}} {{hygienic}} {{and safe}} to use as {{any other type of}} toilet. However, health aspects need to be considered during removal and emptying of the urine and feces containers of a UDDT. These health risks during emptying of the feces vault or container are significantly lower when compared to emptying the pit of pit latrines or the buckets of some types of dry toilets without urine diversion. However, the health risks are somewhat higher when compared to a <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> where the user does not have to carry out any emptying or maintenance tasks at the household level unless the <b>flush</b> <b>toilet</b> plugs, back-flows or otherwise experiences operating problems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>toilets,</b> {{when used}} on ships, are {{typically}} flushed with seawater. Another variant is the pour-flush, <b>flush</b> <b>toilets</b> lacking a cistern, which are flushed manually {{with a few}} litres of a small bucket.
