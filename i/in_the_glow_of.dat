Spears returned to the stage wearing a golden bikini and made her entrance in a boat whose individual parts were wheeled by dancers in Egyptian costumes. Matt Kivel of Variety said, [...] "the crowd reacted wildly to all of it: screaming out the chorus to 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' pulsating along to the twitch of 'Gimme More' and going absolutely ballistic for the brief, two-verse rendition of '...Baby One More Time.'" [...] Craig S.

2500|$|By {{his first}} solo {{exhibition}} in 1900-1901 in the Art Pavilion in Zagreb, his painting style had changed, with brighter colours appearing, and themes of landscapes and seascapes which were {{to remain a}} favourite subject throughout his life. He depicted it {{in a variety of}} different moods – in lively colors with foaming white waves, in somber fog, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> the setting sun and under [...] blue skies. An excellent landscape artist, he recorded characteristic scenes of the region, [...] especially Istria, the Croatian coast and Dalmatia. Some of Crnčić's marine and coastal landscapes were unsurpassed at the time. His painting [...] "Rain" [...] is an excellent example of his mature style, with elements of realism combined with a free composition and a dynamic interplay of colours.|$|E

We suggest that the Fermi mechanism is a possible process for pumping out electrons from the through, and linking this phenomena with electrostatic plasma instabilities. A power law distribution function for trapped electrons is also obtained. Analytical expressions are derived which can be used to calculate these characteristics from geometrical dimensions and the operational parameters of the discharge. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

40|$|International audienceYttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} single crystals (with 9. 5 mol% Y 2 O 3) were irradiated with x-rays and particles.

However, the trap-depth energies (ranging between 0. 8 and 1. 2 eV) deduced from the initial rise of partially cleaned TSL peaks (and from a rough approximation using Urbach's formula) are much larger than the activation energies for defect recovery of 0. 3 eV deduced from the EPR data.
