40|$|Cylindrical vortex {{generators}} placed transversely {{over the}} span of a micro-channel can enhance heat transfer performance, but adding full-span vortex generators incurs a substantial pressure drop penalty. This paper examines the benefits of introducing various gaps {{along the length of}} the vortex generators, both for reducing pressure drop and improving the thermal conductance of the system. Three particular configurations are considered with varied dimensions: symmetrical <b>gaps</b> at each <b>end</b> of the vortex generator, i. e. adjacent to the channel side walls; a single central gap; and a combination of a central and <b>end</b> <b>gaps.</b> The performance is investigated numerically via 3 D finite element analysis for Reynolds number in the range 300 - 2300 and under conditions of a uniform heat flux input relevant to microelectronics cooling. Results demonstrate that having <b>end</b> <b>gaps</b> alone substantially improves heat transfer while reducing the pressure drop. As well as generating longitudinal vortices which draw heat from the adjacent channel side walls, hot fluid passing through the gaps is swept directly upwards and inwards into the bulk flow, where it remains as it flows to the outlet.

40|$|Abstract: Ring and {{cylinder}} bore wear {{may not be}} a problem in most current automotive engines. However, a small change in ring face and {{cylinder bore}} diameter can significantly affect the lubrication characteristics and ring axial motion. This in turn can cause to change inter-ring pressure, blow-by and oil consumption in an engine. Therefore, by predicting the wear of piston ring face and cylinder bore altogether, the changed ring <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> and the changed volume of gas reservoir can be calculated. Then the excessive oil consumption can be predicted. Here, the oil amount through top ring gap into combustion chamber is estimated as engine oil consumption. Furthermore, the wear theories of ring and cylinder bore are included. The changed oil consumption caused by the new <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> and the new volume of oil reservoir around second land, can be calculated at some engine running interval. Meanwhile, the wear amount and oil consumption occurred during engine durability cycle are compared with the calculated values.

The calculated wear data of each part are turn out to be around the band of averaged test values or a little below. It is shown that the important factor regarding oi...|$|E

Away from the top-ring gap, we detect a wall-jet comprised of unburned charge exiting the top ring-land crevice opening. At the location of the top-ring gap, we observed unburned fuel lying in the cool boundary layer along the cylinder wall during the later stages of the expansion stroke. This layer is scraped into the roll-up vortex during the exhaust stroke. These data lead us to conclude that away from the <b>end</b> <b>gap,</b> unburned, high pressure charge, trapped between the two compression rings escapes as a wall jet after ring-reversal near the bottom center.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was the use}} of distributed computing to improve the modeling of the interaction between passenger cars and trucks. The two main focus areas were the development of a methodology to combine microscopic traffic simulation programs with driving simulator programs, and the application of a prototype distributed traffic simulation to study the impact of the length of an impeding vehicle on passing behavior. The methodology was motivated by the need to provide an easier way to create calibrated traffic flows in driving simulations and to capture vehicle behavior within microscopic traffic simulations. The original design for the prototype was to establish a two-way, real time exchange of vehicle data, however problems were encountered that imposed limitations on its development and use. The passing study was motivated by the possible changes in federal truck size and weight regulations and the current inconsistency between the passing sight distance criteria for the design of two lane highways and the marking of no-passing zones. Test drivers made passing maneuvers around impeding vehicles that differed in length and speed. The main effects of the impeding vehicle length were found to be significant for the time and distance in the left lane, and the start and <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> distances. Passing equations were formulated based on the mechanics of the passing maneuver and included behavior variables for calibration. Through a sensitivity analysis, it was shown that increases in vehicle speeds, vehicle length, and gap distance increased the distance traveled in the left lane, while increases in the speed difference and speed gain decreased the distance traveled in the left lane. The passing equations were calibrated using the current AASHTO values and used to predict the impact of increased vehicle lengths on the time and distance in the left lane. The passing equations are valuable for evaluating passing sight distance criteria and observed passing behavior...|$|E

40|$|Compressor {{efficiency}} variation with rotor tip gap is {{assessed using}} numerical simulations on an embedded stage representative {{of that in}} a large industrial gas turbine with Reynolds number being approximately 2 x 106 to 7 x 106. The results reveal three distinct behaviors of efficiency variation with tip gap. For relatively small tip gap (less than 0. 8 % span), the change in efficiency with tip gap is non-monotonic with an optimum tip gap for maximum efficiency. The optimum tip gap is set by two competing flow processes: decreasing tip leakage mixing loss and increasing viscous shear loss at the casing with decreasing tip gap. An optimum tip gap scaling is established and shown to satisfactorily quantify the optimal gap value. For medium tip gap (0. 8 % - 3. 4 % span), the efficiency decreases approximately on a linear basis with increasing tip clearance. However, for tip gap beyond a threshold value (3. 4 % span for this rotor), the efficiency becomes less sensitive to tip gap as the blade tip becomes more aft-loaded thus reducing tip flow mixing loss in the rotor passage. The threshold value is set by the competing effects between increasing tip leakage flow and decreasing tip flow induced mixing loss with increasing tip gap. Thus, to desensitize compressor performance variation with blade gap, rotor should be tip aft-loaded and hub fore-loaded while stator should be tip fore-loaded and hub aft-loaded as much as feasible. This reduces the opportunity for clearance flow mixing loss and maximizes the benefits of reversible work from unsteady effects in attenuating the clearance flow through the downstream blade-row. The net effect can be an overall compressor performance enhancement in terms of efficiency, pressure rise capability, robustness to <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> variation and potentially useful operable range broadening.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 57 - 59). Modern turbomachinery design directs towards the ographics. generation or utilization of increasing amounts of power with the minimum engine weight. High performance turbomachinery requires of appropriate means to ensure structural isolation of components and rotor vibration limits with tolerance to sudden imbalance loads due to blade loss events, shock, and maneuver actions. Squeeze film dampers (SFDS) are an effective mean to reduce vibrations and to suppress instabilities in high performance aeroengine systems. The recently developed integral squeeze film dampers (ISFDS) offer several advantages over conventional SFDS such as reduced overall weight and length of the damper structure with less number of parts, accuracy of positioning (centering), and a split segment construction allowing easier assembly, inspection, and retrofit than with any other type of damper. The objective of the experimental program is the identification of the damping coefficients of sealed ISFDS from measurements of the imbalance response of a massive rotor supported on two (identical) integral dampers. Experiments are conducted on dampers with end plate seals of known clearance. The amplitudes of synchronous rotor response at the first critical speed, for increasing levels of imbalance, allow the determination of system amplification factors and the Measurements of oil flow rates, impact tests and imbalance response tests demonstrate that <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> seals render a substantial increase in the ISFD viscous damping coefficients and with only a small reduction on the flow through the dampers. The sealed integral dampers genemte viscous damping coefficients larger than two times the test values obtained earlier for open ended dampers. Conventional (cylindrical) sealed SFDS restrict substantially the lubricant through flow and determine minimal increments in the damping coefficients because the lubricant viscosity decreases as the operating film temperature raises. The experiments further demonstrate that the amplitudes of rotor synchronous response at the first and second critical speeds are proportional to the imbalance displacements. No subsynchronous frequencies or (nonlinear) jump phenomenon are ever observed in any of the tests. FEM predictions of the viscous damping coefficients for the end sealed ISFDS agree favorably with the identified damping coefficients when accounting for the effect of air entrainment in the squeeze film. The experimental verification and theoretical validation of the damping capability of sealed ISFDS demonstrates the benefit of this novel technology of application in high performance turbomachinery...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, OHRQoL after sinus {{augmentation}} was investigated using {{a modified version}} of the G-OHIP. The results showed significant better values for all three subcategories after the treatment, indicating a remarkable benefit for the patients. Concerning the influence of implant indication, edentulous patients showed the most distinct improvement after the procedure. So far, many studies have examined the quality of life in patients treated with dental implants [25 – 28]. However, to our best knowledge, studies investigating quality of life after sinus augmentation are very rare. Mardinger et al. examined the patient’s perception of immediate post-operative recovery after sinus-floor augmentation [29]. In this prospective study, health-related quality of life questionnaire was given to 76 patients evaluating patient perception of recovery in the four areas pain, oral function, general activity, and other symptoms. The results showed that average and maximal pain peaked on post-operative day 1 and improved on post-operative days 4 and 5. Difficulty in mouth opening was greatest on post-operative day 1 and improved on post-operative day 3. Swelling peaked on post-operative day 2 and improved on post-operative day 5. The authors concluded that an average patient undergoing sinus augmentation procedure should expect recovery within 5  days. In a prospective cohort study, Reisine et al. examined quality of life changes among post-menopausal women getting dental implants with bone augmentation procedures using OHIP- 14 questionnaire [30]. The results showed that patients’ quality of life improved continuously from the pre-treatment to the 9 -month assessment. Type of augmentation procedure had no significant influence on quality of life. Better et al. included 18 patients in a prospective clinical study to investigate patient’s perception of immediate post-operative recovery after sinus augmentation, using a minimally invasive implant device [31]. The minimally invasive implant device consisted of a self-tapping implant which contained an L-shaped internal channel allowing the introduction of liquids through the implant body and into the maxillary sinus. The results showed that patients’ perceptions of post-operative symptoms in the tested areas pain, oral function, general activity, and other symptoms were mostly scored “not at all” or “very little” on post-operative day 1, indicating a minimum discomfort through this procedure for the patient. In a prospective non-randomized clinical trial, changes in OHRQoL and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after bone graft harvesting for dental implants with respect to the donor site were examined [32]. Therefore, autologous bone grafts were harvested in 23 patients either from an intra-oral or an extra-oral donor site, followed by implant placements. OHRQoL was analyzed using the OHIP- 49, HRQoL was measured using the short-form 36. In the results, bone harvesting from an extra-oral donor site deteriorated HRQoL substantially more compared with intra-oral donor sites. OHRQoL impaired from baseline to first follow-up in both groups; however, changes were not statistically significant. The authors concluded that in clinical decision-making regarding donor site for bone graft harvesting, patients and clinicians should consider expected decrease in HRQoL if deciding to use extra-oral donor sites. Therefore, the authors recommended to prefer intra-oral donor sites whenever possible. In a recent study of Nickenig et al., OHIP-G 21 was evaluated in 8689 patients with various kinds of indications (free <b>end</b> <b>gap,</b> posterior single-tooth gap, anterior single-tooth gap, dental gap, and edentulous jaw) for dental implants [33]. Comparable to our results, the results showed an improved OHRQoL for all indications after prosthetic reconstruction. The modification of our OHIP score complicates the comparability of the baseline results of the mentioned study with our results. However, also patients with edentulous jaws and patients with an anterior single-tooth gap benefited most significantly from the treatment.|$|E
