40|$|Wavelet-based {{encoding}} is now {{emerging as}} an {{efficient way to}} encode video for stream-ing over the Internet and for wireless applications. Wavelet-based video coding has been recently added to the JPEG- 2000 video standards. However, {{due to the lack of}} long wavelet encoded video streams, most research has so far been based on short video traces. This thesis paper presents a public library of traces of long, as well as short, wavelet encoded videos. Currently, all traces in this library are for intra-coded video sequences. The library includes traces for over 10 one-hour movies, encoded with a wavelet-based codec, as well as several test sequences both in the Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF) and the Common Intermediate Format (CIF) format. Both the <b>frame</b> <b>sizes</b> as well as the frame qualities (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) values) in the traces are included in this library. The statistical characteristics of the traces, including their long range dependence have also been studied. A hump like behavior of the coefficient of variation (CoVX) of <b>frame</b> <b>sizes</b> is observed for increasing video bit rates. A similar hump behavior is observed for the peak to mean ratio of the <b>frame</b> <b>sizes</b> as well. From the video trace analysis, it is clear that the video <b>frame</b> <b>sizes</b> can not be scaled for simulations, as the scaling of <b>frame</b> <b>sizes</b> would not change the variations observed at different bit rates...|$|R

2500|$|In 1996, {{the film}} was given a lengthy and {{controversial}} restoration by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and re-released to theaters. The new print featured restored color and newly created audio, using modern sound effects mixed in DTS digital surround sound. In October 1996, the restored Vertigo premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, with Kim Novak and Patricia Hitchcock in person. At this screening, {{the film was}} exhibited {{for the first time}} in DTS and 70mm, a format with a similar <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> to the VistaVision system in which it was originally shot. When restoring the sound, Harris and Katz wanted to stay as close as possible to the original, and had access to the original music recordings that had been stored in the vaults at Paramount. However, as the project demanded a new 6-channel DTS stereo soundtrack, it was necessary to re-record some sound effects using the Foley process. The soundtrack was remixed at the Alfred Hitchcock Theatre at Universal Studios. [...] Aware that the film had a considerable following, the restoration team knew that they were under particular pressure to restore the film as accurately as possible. [...] To achieve this, they used Hitchcock's original dubbing notes for guidance of how the director wanted the film to sound in 1958. Harris and Katz sometimes added extra sound effects to camouflage defects in the old soundtrack ("hisses, pops, and bangs"); in particular they added extra seagull cries and a foghorn to the scene at Cypress Point. The new mix has also been accused of putting too much emphasis on the score at the expense of the sound effects. The 2005 Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection DVD contains the original mono track as an option. Significant color correction was necessary because of the fading of original Technicolor negatives. In some cases a new negative was created from the silver separation masters, but in many instances this was impossible because of differential separation shrinkage, and because the 1958 separations were poorly made. Separations used three individual films: one for each of the primary colors. In the case of Vertigo, these had shrunk in different and erratic proportions, making re-alignment impossible. As such, significant amounts of computer assisted coloration were necessary. Although the results are not noticeable on viewing the film, some elements were as many as eight generations away from the original negative, in particular the entire [...] "Judy's Apartment" [...] sequence, which is perhaps the most pivotal sequence in the entire film. When such large portions of re-creation become necessary, then the danger of artistic license by the restorers becomes an issue, and the restorers received some criticism for their re-creation of colors that allegedly did not honor the director's and cinematographer's intentions. The restoration team argued that they did research on the colors used in the original locations, cars, wardrobe, and skin tones. One breakthrough moment came when the Ford Motor Company supplied a well-preserved green paint sample for a car used in the film. As the use of the color green in the film has artistic importance, matching a shade of green was a stroke of luck for restoration and provided a reference shade.|$|E

40|$|Bandwidth {{smoothing}} algorithms {{have been}} shown to be effective in reducing the network resource requirements for the delivery of compressed video streams. For stored video, a large number of bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced that are optimal under certain constraints.
