50|$|Depending on the {{workpiece}} material, {{the work is}} generally held {{by the use of}} a magnetic chuck. This may be either an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>chuck,</b> or a manually operated, permanent magnet type chuck; both types are shown in the first image.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} proposal of one segment of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> system. In the theoretical section, we introduce the principle function of chuck systems with permanent magnets, electromagnets and their combinations. The main part focuses on the calculation of the holding force of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> system {{with a combination of}} permanent magnets and electromagnets and verification using finite element method created in the simulation environment FEMM. The aim of assignment is also a practical design of the proposed system...|$|E
50|$|Charles McGill, {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{on the television}} show Better Call Saul is depicted as experiencing the symptoms of EHS. In the episode Alpine Shepherd Boy, a skeptical doctor proves that <b>Chuck's</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> hypersensitivity may not be genuine by surreptitiously turning on the electronics in his hospital bed.|$|R
50|$|That evening, Jimmy entertains Kim Wexler {{with tales}} of his eventful day. Now that he has two wills and a living trust under his belt, she {{suggests}} {{that he could have}} a promising future in elder law. Jimmy considers, but is interrupted when Kim takes a call from Hamlin saying that Chuck is in the hospital. There, Jimmy and Kim explain Chuck's condition to a skeptical doctor who proves that <b>Chuck's</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> hypersensitivity may not be genuine by flipping a switch under the hospital bed. She recommends Chuck be committed to a mental institution, but Jimmy initially decides to take him home. However, Hamlin shows up and tells Jimmy that he has convinced the DA to make sure that Chuck is not committed. Jimmy is infuriated by Hamlin's greed, knowing that if Chuck were to be committed, Jimmy would become his legal guardian and thus have the authority to request and receive Chuck's severance payment from Hamlin's firm. Although he threatens to have Chuck committed just to scare Hamlin, he still ultimately decides to take him home.|$|R
