5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

25|$|But {{after the}} {{movement}} {{took on the}} role as a state-in-waiting in 1975, based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Tindouf, Algeria, this structure proved incapable of dealing with its vastly expanded responsibilities. As a consequence, the old military structure was wedded to the new grass-roots refugee camp administration which had asserted itself in Tindouf, with its system of committees and elected camp assemblies. In 1976, the situation was further complicated by the Sahrawi Republic assuming functions of government in the camps and Polisario-held territories of Western Sahara. The SADR and Polisario institutions often overlapped, and their division of power was often hard to ascertain.|$|E
25|$|In Poland, Seel parted {{ways with}} the Russian army and joined {{a group of}} {{concentration}} camp survivors soon to be brought back to France. The Red Cross soon took over and organised a train convoy. This however did not go west but south, through Odessa and the Black Sea, in terrible sanitary conditions. Seel was still in Poland on 8 May 1945 when the Armistice was declared. In Odessa, as he {{was put in charge}} of order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camp he was in, he contracted malaria. At this time he was also advised to change his name to Celle and hide {{the fact that he was}} Alsatian by saying he was from Belfort.|$|E
25|$|Muslim Cham Albanians that fled in Albania, were {{organised}} {{as refugees}} by the communist-led Albanian government. The Anti-Fascist Committee of Cham Immigrants was created since 1944, {{as part of}} the Anti-Fascist National Liberation Front, led by the communists, in order to lobby for the returning of Chams in their homes and to create the facilities for their surviving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps that were created in Albania. The new post-war Communist government of Albania took the Cham issue to the Paris Peace Conference to demand the repatriation of the Chams and the return of their property, but no answer was given. At the same time, they established refugee camps and distributed Chams throughout Albania, especially in regions like Fier, Durrës and Tirana.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{government}} rhetoric {{to talk of}} the granting of asylum as a humanitarian act. But as Loescher (1992 : 34 - 51) has observed, refugee problems are intensely political and their causes and consequences are intimately linked to political issues. Governments therefore have to walk a tight rope in trying to balance these considerations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> host states, <b>refugee</b> flows present real and potential challenges to policy makers as they can exacerbate tension and contribute to increased levels of violence in intrastate and inter-state politics. States are therefore forced to include <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> factor on their national security calculations. This paper seeks to examine this phenomenon and show to what extent these refugees have been referred to as an issue to influence politics in Uganda. I will start with a brief background and theoretical framework to this phenomenon <b>in</b> Uganda, <b>the</b> response to this phenomenon by government, <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> and <b>the</b> nationals and how all these culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugees</b> invasion of Rwanda...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} West Beirut, Amal {{continued to}} suppress the remaining predominately Sunni, pro-Palestinian militias such as the small Nasserite Sixth of February Movement in June 1986. The PLO was also aided by Lebanese-Kurdish fighters from the Kurdish Democratic Party – Lebanon (KDP–L), who lived with their families alongside the Palestinians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps. Many leftist Lebanese-Kurdish militants joined Palestinian guerrilla movements during the 1975-76 Lebanese civil war, and these militiamen now fought to protect their homes from Amal, as well as supporting their Palestinian comrades. The situation began to cool on 24 June 1986, when the Syrians deployed some of their Commando troops, assisted by a special task-force of 800 Lebanese Army soldiers and Gendarmes from the Internal Security Forces.|$|E
25|$|Al-Hout was {{appointed}} representative {{and head of}} the organization's office in Lebanon in 1965, then joined the PLO's Executive Committee, during its first meeting in July 1966. Al-Hout encouraged the formation of sports clubs and scout troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Lebanon, partly as a means to recruit more refugees into the PLF, and tried to extend these program into the camps of Syria under the guise of the Palestinian Popular Organization. In spring 1966, he allied the PLF with the Palestinian National Liberation Front, a Nasserist faction. Because of internal and external struggles in the PLO, he abdicated his position in the PLO-EC and his post as head of the PLF in the summer of 1968, leaving the latter group leaderless. That same year al-Hout became {{a founding member of the}} Union of Palestinian Writers. A number of other posts were also held by him, including membership in the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists from 1964 to 1976.|$|E
25|$|Teaming up with Aranea, Prompto infiltrates a {{secondary}} research facility located underground. They learn that Verstael {{found a way}} of binding his soul to another body, allowing him to live on in Immortalis. Verstael intends to kill the last remaining Astrals and overthrow the Empire {{so that he can}} rule Eos. Prompto and Aranea destroy the last remaining magitek prototypes, but are unable to locate Immortalis. An announcement from the system mainframe leads to Immortalis being activated, and Prompto and Aranea race back to the surface. There they witness Immortalis emerge, taking the form of an enormous magitek-infused mechanical worm. Immortalis heads towards Gralea as Prompto and Aranea try to destroy it with a machine gun mounted to a snowmobile. In destroying Immortalis, they successfully kill Verstael. Prompto and Aranea part ways, with Prompto venturing on to Gralea and Aranea returning to Tenebrae to assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> effort.

40|$|Between 1938 and 1941, 20, 000 Eastern and Central European Jews fled to Shanghai.

25|$|Following an {{uprising}} by the ethnic Tutsi, {{sometimes referred to}} as a whole as Banyamulenge (although this term only represents people from one area in eastern Zaire—other ethnic Tutsi Kinyarwanda-speaking people include the Banyamasisi and the Banyarutshuru, as an example) people in eastern Zaire in October 1997, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda {{in the last two weeks}} of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as Interahamwe, and soldiers recruited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps before 1996. There are also many innocent Hutu who remain in the forests of eastern Congo, particularly Rutshuru, Masisi and Bukavu, who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to Rwanda. Rebels also use force to prevent these people from returning, as they serve as a human shield.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario Front {{is led by}} a Secretary General. The first Secretary General was Brahim Gali, {{replaced}} in 1974 by El-Ouali at the II Congress of the Polisario Front, followed by Mahfoud Ali Beiba as Interim Secretary General upon his death. In 1976, Mohamed Abdelaziz was elected at the III Congress of the Polisario, and has held the post ever since. The Secretary General is elected by the General Popular Congress (GPC), regularly convened every four years. The GPC is composed of delegates from the Popular Congresses of the refugee camps in Tindouf, which are held biannually in each camp, and of delegates from the women's organization (UNMS), youth organization (UJSARIO), workers' organization (UGTSARIO) and military delegates from the SPLA (see below). All residents of the camps have {{a vote in the}} Popular Congresses, and participate in the administrative work in the camp through base-level 11-person cells, which form the smallest unit of the refugee camp political structure. These typically care for distribution of food, water and schooling in their area, joining in higher-level organs (encompassing several camp quarters) to cooperate and establish distribution chains. There is no formal membership of Polisario; instead, anyone who participates in its work or lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps is considered a member.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a huge}} {{exodus of}} Hindus from East Bengal to {{different}} parts of the Indian Union including West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. There was a major influx of Bengali Hindu refugees in West Bengal after the Kalshira massacre. Thousands of Hindu refugees were stranded at railway stations, steamer stations and at the Dhaka airport. Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy took the responsibility of bringing the refugees to India. He arranged 16 chartered planes to airlift the stranded evacuees from Dhaka airport. He further arranged 15 big passenger steamers to rescue the stranded refugees from Faridpur and Barisal. In March 1950, an estimated 75,000 Bengali Hindu refugees from East Bengal were admitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> camps of West Bengal. Around 200,000 refugees arrived in Tripura in March, 1950. An estimated 110,000 refugees arrived in Karimganj district in Assam from Sylhet district till 2 April 1950. On 11 April 1950, 2,500 Hindu refugees arrived at Shalimar in Howrah from Barisal in four chartered steamers. 20,000 refugees were still awaiting evacuation in Barisal. Till 12 April 1950, 120,000 refugees arrived in West Dinajpur district of West Bengal. Thus more than 500,000 refugees had arrived in West Bengal since the exodus began in January 1950.|$|E
