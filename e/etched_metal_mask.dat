30|$|Graphene {{exhibits}} exciting properties {{which make}} it an appealing candidate for use in electronic devices. Reliable processes for device fabrication are crucial prerequisites for this. We developed a large area of CVD synthesis and transfer of graphene films. With patterning of these graphene layers using standard photoresist masks, {{we are able to}} produce arrays of gated graphene devices with four point contacts. The etching and lift off process poses problems because of delamination and contamination due to polymer residues when using standard resists. We introduce a <b>metal</b> <b>etch</b> <b>mask</b> which minimises these problems. The high quality of graphene is shown by Raman and XPS spectroscopy as well as electrical measurements. The process is of high value for applications, as it improves the processability of graphene using high-throughput lithography and etching techniques.|$|R
40|$|The work {{describes}} recent {{progress in}} the design, simulation, implementation and characterisation of photonic crystal (PhC) GaAs-based quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). The benefits of applying active PhC confinement around a QCL cavity are explained, highlighting a route to reduced threshold current operation. Design of a suitable PhC has been performed using published bandgap maps; simulation results of this PhC show a wide, high reflectivity stopband. Implementation of the PhC for the device is particularly difficult, requiring a very durable metallic dry etch mask, high performance dry etching and a low damage epilayer-down device mounting technique. Preliminary shallow etched PhC QCLs demonstrated the viability of current injection through the <b>metal</b> <b>etch</b> <b>mask</b> and the device mounting technique. Development of the etch mask and dry etching have demonstrated a process suitable for the manufacture of deep etched PhC structures. All the necessary elements for implementing deep etched PhC QCLs have now been demonstrated, allowing {{for the development of}} high performance devices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{modifications to}} and optimisations of a cluster beam source, one application being {{the generation of}} large area catalysis samples. A major modification to the cluster source also enabled coating of clusters in a new way. The impact of Pd_ 5 _ 6 _ 1, Pd_ 5 _ 5 and Pd_ 4 clusters (1, 1. 5 and 1 keV) on a thin material film evaporated onto a solid argon matrix led to deposition of large, 5 - 40 nm diameter, irregularly shaped particles. Furthermore, Pd_ 9 _ 2 _ 3 and Pd_ 2 _ 0 _ 0 _ 0 clusters, with both 0. 5 and 1. 5 keV impact energies, have been coated in-flight by impact on the thin film/solid matrix, as verified from the increase in diameters of the deposited particles and the detection of Pd signal by EELS. MoS_ 2 nano pillar catalyst samples were <b>etched</b> using size-selected <b>metal</b> <b>etch</b> <b>masks.</b> Catalyst samples of ordered MoS_ 2 nano pillars were fabricated using NSL and a novel way to apply nano spheres was developed. Different etch recipes were used to obtain nano pillars with different diameters and heights; these recipes were also applied to reference MoS_ 2 samples without etch masks. Generally, the reference catalyst samples, with their roughened surfaces, showed higher HER activity than their corresponding ordered MoS 2 nano pillar catalyst samples. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{reliable}} process to fabricate GaN/AlGaN one dimensional photonic crystal (1 D-PhC) microcavities with nonlinear optical properties. We used a heterostructure with a GaN layer embedded between two AlGaN/GaN Distributed Bragg Reflectors on sapphire substrate, designed to generate a λ= 800 nm frequency downconverted signal (χ(2) effect) from an incident pump signal at λ= 400 nm. The heterostructure was epitaxially grown by metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) and integrates a properly designed 1 D-PhC grating, which amplifies the signal by exploiting the double effect of cavity resonance and non linear GaN enhancement. The integrated 1 D-PhC microcavity was fabricate combing a high resolution e-beam writing with a deep etching technique. For the pattern transfer we used ~ 170 nm layer Cr <b>metal</b> <b>etch</b> <b>mask</b> obtained by means of high quality lift-off technique based {{on the use of}} bi-layer resist (PMMA/MMA). At the same time, plasma conditions have been optimized in order to achieve deeply etched structures (depth over 1 micron) with a good verticality of the sidewalls (very close to 90 °). Gratings with well controlled sizes (periods of 150 nm, 230 nm and 400 nm respectively) were achieved after the pattern is transferred to the GaN/AlGaN heterostructure. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{fabrication}} of microfluidic devices on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrates for analytical chemistry and biomedical-related applications using novel microfabrication methods are described. The image of microstructures {{is transferred from}} quartz master templates possessing the inverse image of the devices to plastic plates by using hot embossing methods. The micro channels on quartz master templates are formed by the combination of <b>metal</b> <b>etch</b> <b>mask</b> and wet chemical etching of a photomask blank. The micromachined quartz templates can be used repeatedly to replicate cheap and disposable plastic devices. The reproducibility of the hot embossing method is evaluated using 10 channels on different PMMA plastics (Fig. 1). The relative standard deviation of the channel profile on the plastic chips is less than 1 %. In this study, the PMMA microfluidic chips have been demonstrated as a micro capillary electrophoresis (μ-CE) device for DNA separation and detection.

Microcontact {{printing}} techniques employing self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers {{in the production}} of <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> have been combined with CFalOz reactive ion etch for subsequent pattern transfer to sil icon.

40|$|The {{quality of}} pixels on {{displays}} and semiconductors {{is directly related}} to the surface quality of the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> used. Burrs generated on the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> can degrade the quality of pixels on microelectronic devices during the deposition process. In this study, experimental observations of abrasive deburring along with large pulsed electron beam (LPEB) irradiation were performed to evaluate the deburring effects on patterned <b>metal</b> <b>masks.</b> Numerical modeling of LPEB irradiation approximately predicted melting depths and the experimental studies revealed limitations in the size of burrs removed by LPEB irradiation. Thus a LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was developed to eliminate burrs of <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> regardless of their size. The size of burrs remaining after the LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was reduced to approximately 7. 2 μm which was much less than the results of abrasive deburring alone (38. 01 μm). The burr size distribution was reduced by 85 % and surface roughness (Ra) was decreased from 640 nm to 121 nm, indicating a uniform surface texture. close...|$|R
