To achieve this effect, the nine interconnected pavilions, where concessions, restrooms, and luxury suites are located, are built separately from the main seating area. The space between these pavilions allows for improved air flow in the Texas heat; the wind can move through the buildings and is not impeded by their presence. Constructed of James Hardie <b>fiber</b> <b>cement</b> siding, architectural critics have commented that their layout and material choice enhances the village-like feel of the ballpark, giving it a [...] "coastal Galveston aesthetic".

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} <b>cement</b> (FRC) composites {{have been}} classified {{according to many}} criteria, such as the fiber material (steel, synthetic, natural organic) or the level of performance, a general, simple and convenient classification has been recently suggested. It {{is based on the}} response of the composite under tensile loading, which can be described as either strain softening after first cracking, or strain hardening. Such a classification suggests a level of performance irrespective of the fiber type, fiber content, or matrix composition. After explaining this terminology and its implications, it is suggested that strain-hardening FRC composites are particularly suitable for structural applications. These include stand-alone applications, for example, pipes or thin sheets, applications in parts of structures such as in beam column connections of seismically designed structures, or full scale applications such as those in impact resistant and protective structures. 1.

40|$|Abstract. Carbon <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} <b>cement</b> {{could sense}} its own temperature {{based on the}} temperature resistivity effect. In contrast with Portland cement, sulphoaluminate cement has much better freeze-resistance. As a result, carbon <b>fiber</b> sulphoaluminate <b>cement</b> composite (CFSC) has the superior potential to sense its own temperature than carbon <b>fiber</b> reinforced Portland <b>cement</b> in the negative and positive temperature, especially for the negative temperature range. The temperature resistivity effect of CFSC was discussed in {{the positive and negative}} temperature. And the lower and the upper temperature limit of temperature resistivity effect were investigated. The results indicated that temperature resistivity effect of CFSC was related to the hot expansion and the electric carrier activating. And the electric carrier activating was the primary influence factor. Temperature sensors could be made by CFSC based on its good temperature resistivity effect in positive and negative temperature range. Therefore CFSC has the advantage to sense positive and negative temperature by resistivity measurement...|$|R

Moreover, the degree of dispersion of fibers in mortar was increased and the eVectiveness of the fibers for reducing the drying shrinkage was improved.
