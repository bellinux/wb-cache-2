40|$|<b>Electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> {{has become}} a widely {{accepted}} technique for application of paint coating and is being adopted for coating a variety of metal articles for corrosion protection {{as well as for}} decoration. Several resin systems have been used for this purpose depending on the specific application for which the coating is used. For example for excellent corrosion protection, primer coatings based on epoxies and polybutadiene are used. Acrylic coatings have not very good fade resistance properties and can be used for decorative applications over different metallic substrates. This paper deals with some of the studies made mainly on the bath characteristics of the acrylic system. The main parameters studied include the effect of conductivity of the solution on deposition characteristics, the throwing power at different operating parameters and columbic efficiency with and without pigmentation. Some of the physical properties like bond strength of cured coatings, hardness, abrasion resistance and also corrosion resistance are also reported in this pape...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>paint</b> {{has become}} one of the {{effective}} methods of application of coatings. It has several advantages over conventional paint application methods, the most important one being the control of pollution, since water is the main solvent used in the process in place of toxic organic solvents. Both anodic and cathodic processes have been developed, but the latter has clear cut advantages over the former, because, in cathodic process, the substrate dissolution can be avioded, which helps in eliminating the threat of coating discoloration and also the bath instability. Epoxy resins are well known for their corrosion protective properties. In the present work, water soluble epoxy resin is prepared by modifying with amine for getting cathode systems. The resin, on dissolution in water by adding organic acids, could be cathodically deposited. The studies made with the cathodic epoxy resin with and without pigmentation and also the evaluation of the electrocoating are detailed in this pape...|$|E

30|$|<b>Electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> {{platinum}} {{and silver}} into hydrophobic and hydrophilic microporous silicon layers was investigated using chemically modified microporous silicon electrodes. Hydrophobic microporous silicon enhanced the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> platinum in the porous layer. Meanwhile, hydrophilic one showed that platinum was hardly deposited within the porous layer, and {{a film of}} platinum {{on the top of}} the porous layer was observed. On the other hand, the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> silver showed similar deposition behavior between these two chemically modified electrodes. It was also found that the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> silver started at the pore opening and grew toward the pore bottom, while a uniform deposition from the pore bottom was observed in platinum electrodeposition. These electrodeposition behaviors are explained on the basis of the both effects, the difference in overpotential for metal deposition on silicon and on the deposited metal, and displacement deposition rate of metal.|$|R

The literature concerning the fast <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> metals has been reviewed with {{particular attention to the}} <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> nickel. A study <b>of</b> the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> nickel has been carried out in concentrated Ni sulphamate solutions at 50 - 70 °C in parallel plate cells at Reynolds numbers of up to 15, 000.

Additional studies have been made of current distribution in both the nickel and acid copper systems using segmented electrodes.

30|$|Until date, {{thiocyanate}} (KCN−) {{is reported}} to be a suitable complexing agent for single-step <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> CuGaSe 2 films. The shift in the reduction potential of Cu towards the lower cathodic potential makes assimilation of Ga 3 + ions easier in the form of Ga 2 Se 3 to the growing of CuGaSe 2 film. Oda et al. reported crack free CGS thin films with lithium sulfate (Li 2 SO 4) and gelatin [82]. Using DES such as reline, successful <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> CGSe has been reported [75]. <b>Electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> Cu–Ga alloy using copper–gallium nitrate salts is also a good approach, where the inclusion of Ga takes place in the form of oxides/hydroxides [63].|$|R

The tetrabutylammonium halometallates, [NnBu 4][InCl 4], [NnBu 4][SbCl 4], [NnBu 4][BiCl 4], [NnBu 4] 2 [SeCl 6] and [NnBu 4] 2 [TeCl 6], are readily dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 and form reproducible electrochemical systems with good stability {{in the presence of}} a [NnBu 4]Cl supporting electrolyte.

The compatibility of the reagents permits the preparation of a single electrolyte containing several halometallate species which allows the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> binary materials, as is demonstrated for InSb.

40|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{purification}} and processing operations involving actinide species that rely on high-temperature molten salts as the solvent medium. One such application is the electrorefining of impure actinide metals to provide high purity material for subsequent applications. There are some drawbacks to the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> actinides in molten salts including relatively low yields, lack of accurate potential control, maintaining efficiency in a highly corrosive environment, and failed runs. With these issues in mind we have been investigating the <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> actinide metals, mainly uranium, from room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and relatively high-boiling organic solvents. The RTILs we have focused on are comprised of 1, 3 -dialkylimidazolium or quaternary ammonium cations and mainly the {sup -}N(SO{sub 2 }CF{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } anion [bis(trif 1 uoromethylsulfonyl) imide {equivalent_to} {sup -}NTf{sub 2 }]. These materials represent a class of solvents that possess great potential for use in applications employing electrochemical procedures. In order to ascertain the feasibility of using RTILs for bulk <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> actinide metals our research team has been exploring the electron transfer behavior of simple coordination complexes of uranium dissolved in the RTIL solutions. More recently we have begun some fundamental electrochemical studies on the behavior of uranium and plutonium complexes in the organic solvents N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Our most recent results concerning electrodeposition will be presented in this account. The electrochemical behavior of U(IV) and U(III) species in RTILs and the relatively low vapor pressure solvents NMP and DMSO is described. These studies have been ongoing in our laboratory to uncover conditions that will lead to the successful bulk <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> actinide metals at a working electrode surface at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures. The RTILs we have focused on thus far are based on 1, 3 -dialkylimidazolium or quaternary ammonium cations and {sup -}N(SO{sub 2 }CF{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } anions. Our results from XPS studies of e 1 ectrooxidized uranium metal surfaces indicate that uranium metal reacts with the anion from the RTIL, most likely through an initial f 1 uoride abstraction, forming decomposition products that inhibit the bulk <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> uranium metal. Similar results were found when the organic solvents were used with TBA[B(C{sub 6 }F{sub 5 }) {sub 4 }] as the supporting electrolyte, although the voltammetric data of uranium ions in these solutions is more encouraging in relation to <b>electrodeposition</b> <b>of</b> uranium metal.

30|$|Common {{methods for}} the {{deposition}} of phase-change materials use {{physical vapour deposition}} (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD) [9 – 12]. Comparing with those conventional techniques, electrodeposition offers several potentially significant advantages {{for the growth of}} semiconductor alloys [13 – 16]. It is a fast and lower cost alternative to the vapour deposition techniques as it does not require ultra-high vacuum (UHV) equipment or high temperatures, and it can fill high-aspect-ratio cells.
