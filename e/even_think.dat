5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|Their {{happiness}} {{together is}} brought to an end when Calchas persuades Agamemnon to arrange Cressida's return to him {{as part of a}} hostage exchange in which the captive Trojan Antenor is freed. The two lovers are distraught and <b>even</b> <b>think</b> of eloping together but they finally cooperate with the exchange. Despite Cressida's initial intention to remain faithful to Troilus, the Greek warrior Diomedes wins her heart. When Troilus learns of this, he seeks revenge on Diomedes and the Greeks and dies in battle. Just as Cressida betrayed Troilus, Antenor was later to betray Troy.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
25|$|To {{explain the}} {{categories}} in more detail, {{they are the}} preconditions {{of the construction of}} objects in the mind. Indeed, to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an a priori cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|Since Charles Darwin, the {{willingness}} of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated {{members of the same}} large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still feel like they know them and <b>even</b> <b>think</b> of them as like family.|$|E
50|$|Most Ukrainian {{do not see}} it as a holiday, but as an {{ordinary}} day off; about 10% <b>even</b> <b>thinks</b> it should be a working day (12% in 2008; this number had shrunk from 14% in 2003). Only in Western Ukraine the holiday is among the list of most respected holidays in Ukraine.|$|R

25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can <b>even</b> <b>think</b> to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E

500|$|It [...] shoots its load quickly, {{although}} just as effectively: [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] and [...] "Soldier" [...] are stunning, both {{displaying the}} Beyoncé trademark of creepily submissive lyrics matched with dominatrix vocals and arrangements to superb effect.

[...] which sounds like a military command, and proceeds to put you {{through a series of}} moves without pause for breath, Beyoncé and her minions cracking the whip every time you <b>even</b> <b>think</b> of flagging.|$|E
500|$|IGN.com {{felt that}} Just Dance was [...] "an {{experience}} so devoid of depth or even basic game concepts {{that it would}} be considered a rip-off even if {{it was one of those}} Chinese knock-off systems masquerading as an existing console", further criticizing the game for its basic gameplay mechanics, [...] "sloppy" [...] motion detection, lack of variation or unlockable content, and ironically excluding the Lady Gaga song the game's title references. IGN concluded by urging readers not to buy, rent, or <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about Just Dance, [...] "lest someone at Ubisoft find out and they prep a Just Dance 2. Such would be the end of all things, mark my words." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} a hostile reception in some quarters, with critics charging {{that it was}} poorly researched and/or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. The German historian Hans Mommsen disparaged the first edition as [...] "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices". Israeli Holocaust historian Israel Gutman called the book [...] "a lampoon", stating [...] "this is not research; it isn't even political literature... I don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> it should be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book." [...] The book was also harshly criticized by Brown University Professor Omer Bartov and University of Chicago Professor Peter Novick.|$|E
50|$|Both Durr-e-Shehwar and Mansoor love Shandana and Sophia a lot. But Shandana envies {{her mother}} {{thinking}} that she led a comfortable and happy {{life with a}} loving husband and nothing to worry about. And thus, she often compares Haider and her father. Shandana also undergoes a stage of semi-depression and <b>evens</b> <b>thinks</b> of divorcing Haider. When Mansoor gets to know this, he gets angry on Haider. He reports this matter to his sister i.e. Haider's mother, thus, further complicating the matter.|$|R

500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better... I <b>even</b> <b>think</b> {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't be bothered to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about girls' hair styles". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".|$|E

Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter [...] invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; [...] Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E

We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard." [...] Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun said he did not <b>even</b> <b>think</b> back on Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos. [...] Butler said that this [...] "almost sent the band crazy". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.|$|E
