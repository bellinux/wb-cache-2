5|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Joaquim Inácio began his {{education}} {{at home and}} was later enrolled in Seminário de São José (Saint Joseph School) and after that, in Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. His teachers included Januário da Cunha Barbosa, who later {{became one of the}} leading figures in the Brazilian independence movement. Joaquim Inácio chose to follow his father, a naval officer who achieved the rank of second lieutenant, in his choice of a career. On 20 November 1822 at the age of 14, Joaquim Inácio was admitted as aspirante a guarda-marinha (aspiring midshipman or naval cadet) at the Navy Academy. On 11 December 1823, he graduated from the academy, majoring in mathematics, with the rank of guarda-marinha (midshipman). As he had in previous studies at other schools, Joaquim Inácio proved to be a brilliant student. Among <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> academy was Francisco Manuel Barroso da Silva (later Baron of Amazonas) whom he befriended.|$|E
5|$|When Japanese forces {{took control}} of the Indies in 1942, the empire's Dōmei Tsushin news agency {{established}} a branch office in Jakarta. Antara was renamed Yashima on 29May, and it was eventually absorbed by the Dōmei news network three months later. Press activity flourished as Dōmei opened offices in major cities throughout Java. When Indonesia's independence was proclaimed on 17August 1945, Adam Malik obtained a copy of the text and dictated it by telephone to <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> agency. The resulting news bulletin slipped past Japanese censors and was broadcast throughout Dōmei's newswire network. Dōmei officials attempted to retract the bulletin, but a courier was able to deliver a copy of the proclamation using the agency's name to the Hōsō Kanrikyoku radio station in midst of the confusion. Antara assumed control of Dōmei's local network when the Japanese surrendered to Allied forces weeks later and reopened under private management on 3September.|$|E

25|$|Although his {{popularity}} {{at the regional}} level fluctuated greatly, {{it is believed that}} Rajagopalachari was able to exercise his stranglehold over provincial politics mainly because he was favoured by national leaders such as Gandhi, Patel and Nehru. Critics feel that when the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee K. Kamaraj and a majority of the provincial leaders turned against him in the 1940s, Rajagopalachari clung on to a position of influence in regional politics through support from <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Freitag and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) again {{tried to}} engage the Navy in FBM {{development}} by funneling their research to a secret study committee chaired by Massachusetts Institute of Technology president James R. Killian. The Killian Committee had a charter to unify the ballistic missile programs scattered among the services, and enthusiastically recommended that the Navy develop a fleet-based intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). This external endorsement by a distinguished independent evaluator persuaded the chief of BuAir, Rear Admiral James S. Russell, to fully commit the bureau to FBM development.|$|E

25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) {{with the}} Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount {{is larger than}} currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 {{was found in a}} relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period.|$|E

When Sharaf joined the Egyptian mission at New York it was headed by ambassador Omar Loutfi, one of Egypt’s most distinguished, accomplished and vocal diplomats. Loutfi was a fervent nationalist who opposed superpower expansion and involvement in the Middle East. He would instill in Sharaf a respect {{for the importance of}} upholding international law in an increasingly divided and polarized world. Loutfi would later assume the position of Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs. Loutfi, a one-time President of the United Nations Security Council, would die on the premises of the UN building at New York of a heart attack on 17 May 1963.|$|E
25|$|PfEMP1 was {{discovered}} by Russell J. Howard and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US National Institutes of Health in 1984. Using the techniques of radioiodination and immunoprecipitation, they found a unique but yet unknown antigen from P. falciparum-infected RBCs that appeared to cause binding with other cells. Since the antigenic protein could only be detected in infected cells, they asserted that the protein was produced by the malarial parasite, and not by RBCs. The antigen was large {{and appeared to be}} different in size in different strains of P. falciparum obtained from night monkey (Aotus). In one strain, called Camp (from Malaysia), the antigen was found to have a molecular size of approximately 285 kDa; while in the other, called St. Lucia (from El Salvador), it was approximately 260 kDa. Both antigens bind to cultured skin cancer (melanoma) cells. But the researchers failed to confirm whether or not the protein actually was an adhesion molecule to the wall of blood vessels. Later in the same year, they found out that the unknown antigen was associated only with RBCs having small lumps called knobs on their surface. The first human RBC antigen was reported in 1986. Howard's team found that the antigens from Gambian children, who were suffering from falciparum malaria, were similar to those from the RBCs of night monkey. They determined that the molecular sizes of the proteins ranged from 250 to 300 kDa.|$|E

500|$|Aberdeen, {{a coastal}} city, gave Struthers the {{opportunity}} to observe the whales which were {{from time to time}} washed up on Scotland's coast. In 1870 he observed, dissected and described a Blue Whale (which he called a [...] "Great Fin-Whale") from Peterhead. He brought the entire skeleton of a sei whale back to the anatomy department at Aberdeen, where for a century it was suspended overhead in the hall. He vigorously collected examples {{of a wide range of}} species to form a museum of zoology, with the intention of illustrating Darwin's theories. As an energetic and forceful personality with a strong enthusiasm for zoology, he alarmed <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Aberdeen by constantly asking for money and space to acquire and house his collection.|$|E
500|$|There was {{conflict}} at the Mint between Pistrucci and William Wyon, {{that sometimes}} involved Merlen. According to Graham Pollard in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, [...] "Pistrucci's temperament did not foster {{good relations with}} <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mint; the insecurity of his position there was deepened by a spasmodic but bitter campaign conducted through the newspapers by his partisans and those of William Wyon." [...] Pistrucci appealed to each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the post of chief engraver. In 1828, the incumbent Master, George Tierney, worked a compromise that satisfied no one. Wyon was appointed as chief engraver, and Pistrucci as chief medallist, with the salaries of the top two engraving positions divided between them. Of Pistrucci's salary of £350, £50 was conditional on his training an apprentice. Pistrucci in succession named two of his sons, but the allowance was stopped after 1830 as {{it had come to}} light that each resided abroad, and one was not a British subject and so was ineligible for regular Mint employment. Pistrucci's understanding of the arrangement was that he would create such medals as might be ordered by government departments, with each medal a separate fee in addition to the annual salary.|$|E
