25|$|The {{essential}} {{differences between}} a traditional cask and a keg {{are that the}} latter has a centrally located downtube and a valve that allows beer in and <b>gas</b> <b>out</b> when filling and vice versa when beer is dispensed. Also kegs have a simple concave bottom whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or centrifuging, {{or some combination of}} these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional hand pump at the bar.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or <b>gas</b> <b>out)</b> and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the <b>gas</b> <b>out</b> at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region.

This water can then be heated and turned into steam to run another turbine. Economizers can also use a heat exchanger to heat the feed water for a boiler. Deaerators purpose is to remove non-condensable <b>gases</b> <b>out</b> of the feed water for boilers. These gases cause corrosion in which can affect {{the safety of the}} boiler.

2500|$|For the {{analysis}} of volatile compounds, a purge and trap (P) concentrator system {{may be used to}} introduce samples. [...] The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber. [...] An inert gas such as Nitrogen (N2) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging or sparging. [...] The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the purge <b>gas)</b> <b>out</b> of the chamber. [...] The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'. [...] The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. [...] The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system. [...] P GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).|$|E

2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the <b>gas</b> <b>out</b> of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E

2500|$|Natural gas is {{typically}} produced {{in association with}} oil from wells. [...] Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. [...] In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed [...] conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported in pipelines for useful purposes. [...] In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. [...] That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a [...] "certificate of public convenience and necessity" [...] (certificate) before making any sale for resale natural gas in interstate commerce. The FPC set the maximum prices charged for gas sold under a certificate. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. [...] The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. [...] Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the [...] "production and gathering" [...] of gas was exempt from federal regulation, although potentially subject to state control. [...] Production means bringing the <b>gas</b> <b>out</b> of the ground to a pipe {{at the top of}} the wellhead. [...] Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low pressure lines to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 3 February, the PAVN {{commander}} seeing the buildup of Marines at Huế University thinned out his frontline forces leaving just a platoon to defend the Treasury Building and adjacent post office. On the morning of 4 February the Marines launched their attack on the Treasury complex, the initial assault was on the left flank by Company A, 1/1 Marines which was tasked with securing a Catholic chapel and the Jeanne d'Arc High School (...) [...] The Marines secured the chapel and the east school building, but were pinned down for hours by interlocking fire from the west building. During this action Sergeant Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez would be killed while firing on PAVN machine gun positions, he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. The Marines eventually broke into the west building and cleared it room by room. Due to the delays on the left flank, the main assault in the centre by Company F, 2/5 Marines was delayed until mid-afternoon. The Treasury compound was hit by M-48 and 106mm fire and tear gas, while a Mule-mounted 106mm engaged the machine gun in the Le Loi Elementary School. Under cover of the tear gas and the 106mm backblast the Marines crossed the street and blew holes in the wall using C4 and Bazookas. The Marines then pushed into the Treasury building which the PAVN had hastily abandoned. The post office also seemed abandoned until the Marines located a vault inside the building, they proceeded to <b>gas</b> <b>out</b> the PAVN inside killing more than 24 of them as they emerged.
