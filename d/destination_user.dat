The <b>destination</b> <b>user</b> identifier is based on presentity’s URI. Such a system achieves uniform load sharing on the servers on an average. However, in certain cases the load may not be uniformly distributed on all the servers. We propose to use load metric based static allocation algorithm to distribute the load uniformly. The load metric determination and performance evaluation of such a strategy is identified as future work. Additionally, we explain load sharing architecture for XCAP server, which is based on HTTP request redirection which is similar to load sharing in web servers...|$|E
30|$|In {{the context}} of multi-hop {{cellular}} communications, user equipment devices (UEs) with relaying capabilities provide a virtual infrastructure that can enhance the cell spectral efficiency. UE relays, which are generally transparent to the <b>destination</b> <b>user</b> and lack channel state information, mainly operate in an open-loop mode. Most open-loop transmission techniques for relaying are based on orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC), which offers a good trade-off between performance and complexity. In this paper, we consider the concept of multi-functional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, which combines OSTBC with beamforming techniques. This concept is applied to networks with multiple relays, which can offer {{a high number of}} antennas to implement multi-functional MIMO techniques. The proposed schemes are shown to reduce the bit error rate of the <b>destination</b> <b>user</b> with respect to a direct transmission from the base station (BS). Furthermore, the multi-functional setup exhibits better performance than conventional OSTBC at high transmission rates.|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{town with}} N {{competing}} sources of content where each one wishes to dis-seminate its own content and thus to make its content available to as many <b>destination</b> <b>users</b> as possible. The dissemination to the potential destination is done through a fleet of M mobile relays. The rate of dissemination of content of a given source to its potential destinations depends on how many relays {{have a copy of}} the content. We therefore focus on the problem of competition over the access to relays. Each source has to trade between the access costs and and the availability of his content in the relays. As access cost we consider here the transmission power used by the source. The power used determines the coverage of the transmission and thus the probability of reaching some relay. We model the competition using stochastic game approaches and then obtain the structure of the equilibrium strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} a {{collision}} {{area in a}} heterogeneous cellular network {{for the purpose of}} interference management between Device-to-Device (D 2 D) and conventional cellular (CC) communications. Currently, most D 2 D routing algorithms assume synchronized accurate location knowledge among users and the base stations. In reality, this level of location accuracy is difficult and power consuming in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). In current LongTerm Evolution (LTE), there is no location information from the cell besides range information from time measurements. In the absence of accurate location information, we analyze the collision probability of the D 2 D multi-hop path hitting the defined collision area. Specifically, we consider the problem for three different routing scenarios: intra-cell, intra-cell to cell boundary, and cell boundary to boundary routing. As a result, we propose a dynamic switching strategy between D 2 D and CC communications in order to minimize mutual interference. The gradient-based switching strategy can avoid collision with the collision area and only requires knowledge of the current user and the final <b>destination</b> <b>user’s</b> distances to the serving base station...|$|R
