We document, for the first time, the effects of overpressured hydrothermal <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> within travertine deposits. We also describe tectofacies interpreted {{as a consequence of}} coseismic events. Calcite veins, banded or massive, associated with hydrofracture and fluid-escape features, promoted hydrothermal eruptions and lithoclast formation in latest Quaternary travertine exposed in two quarries near Rapolano Terme (Northern Apennines, Italy). The isotopic composition of the calcite veins confirms the hydrothermal origin of the parent fluids and their rapid ascent, as indicated by the estimated palaeo-temperatures (43 – 50 °C). Integration of U–Th ages obtained for the calcite veins with palaeoseismic evidence from a local archaeological site built at the top of one of the analysed travertine deposits suggests that hydrofracture and fluid- escape structures were associated with five main seismic events that occurred from the latest Pleistocene to the fourth century AD. In sum, the travertine tectofacies have a key role in better constraining the seismotectonic setting of a region and thus offer a powerful tool for the evaluation of seismic hazard for areas characterized by low seismicity and travertine deposition...|$|E
30|$|The {{recovery}} factor from tight gas reservoirs is typically less than 15 %, even with multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation. Such low recovery is exacerbated in tight gas condensate reservoirs, where {{the depletion of}} gas leaves the valuable condensate behind. In this paper, three enhanced gas recovery (EGR) methods including produced gas injection, CO 2 injection and water injection are investigated to increase the well productivity for a tight gas condensate reservoir in the Montney Formation, Canada. The production performance of the three EGR methods is compared and their economic feasibility is evaluated. Sensitivity analysis of the key factors such as primary production duration, bottom-hole pressures, and fracture conductivity is conducted and their effects on the well production performance are analyzed. Results show that, compared with the simple depletion method, both the cumulative gas and condensate production increase with <b>fluids</b> <b>injected.</b> Produced gas injection leads to both a higher gas and condensate production {{compared with those of}} the CO 2 injection, while waterflooding suffers from injection difficulty and the corresponding low sweep efficiency. Meanwhile, the injection cost is lower for the produced gas injection due to the on-site available gas source and minimal transport costs, gaining more economic benefits than the other EGR methods.|$|E
30|$|The in situ {{saturation}} monitoring {{was also}} used to understand the performance {{of each of the}} <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> at different stages of oil recovery. Figure  10 shows the changes in water saturation across the length of the core. At the end of water flooding (SW flooding), the average water saturation was 0.52. While during low-salinity water flooding, there was a slide change in the saturation during the last flow rate of injection and occurred mainly {{towards the end of the}} core. At the end of polymer flooding, there was change in saturation across the length of the core sample even with the high level of heterogeneity which resulted in high capillary end effect. This indicates that the polymer was able to increase the sweep efficiency. It can also be inferred from the ISSM that low salinity water flooding only minimized the capillary end effect as a result of the high flow rate. The in situ saturation monitoring profiles correlates with the volumetric production data as well as CT image (Fig.  12) which shows poor oil displacement along the core length due to high heterogeneity as well as vugs. Thus, lack of additional oil recovery during polymer flooding compared to Exp. 1 could be due to the heterogeneity and vugs in the core plug. Comparison between volumetric production data and ISSM was done and is shown in Fig.  11.|$|E

Twelve dogs were sacrificed 18 hr later when specimens of blood, loop fluid, and bowel wall were obtained for cultures; the remaining animals were sacrificed at 3 hr and served as operative controls.

Those tungsten deposits are spatially and temporally {{associated with the}} granitic magmatism during the Late Mesozoic (J(2) -K- 2). It is common that alteration halos decrease with increasing depth at the vein-type tungsten deposits. However, the mechanisms forming the alteration characteristics are still enigmatic. In this contribution, we investigate the influences of variable fluid density and viscosity on the fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to adjacent wallrock at the Dajishan tungsten deposit using finite element based numerical experiments. Fluid density has a negative influence on the transient pressure-driven fluid flow at Dajishan. Large-density fluids slow fluid flow and heat transfer. High-viscosity fluids flow slowly. Variations of fluid viscosity at Dajishan are large and influence hydrothermal fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to surrounding wallrock. Depth-dependent porosity and permeability of wallrock are effective mechanisms forming the alteration halos at Dajishan. Hydraulic and geometric characteristics of joint zones influence diffusion of chemical species at {{the initial stages of}} hydrothermal <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> into fractures. High-permeability narrow joint zones favor formation of thick alteration halos at shallower levels. Depth-dependent wallrock porosity also impedes diffusion of metals from fractures to adjacent wallrock increasing ore formation efficiency at Dajishan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{moderate}} {{increase in}} crude oil recovery by reduction in salinity of the injection brine {{has been observed}} for numerous laboratory core flood experiments. The underlying mechanisms behind increased recovery by low salinity injection are not fully understood and are suggested to relate to complex crude oil/rock/brine interactions. Recent studies have also shown a positive effect by combining injection of low salinity brine and surfactant flooding. In this study, core experiments were conducted in four aged Bentheimer cores; two experiments were performed at 23 °C and two experiments at 90 °C. During low salinity and low salinity surfactant injection pH of the effluent was measured. In addition, density, viscosity and interfacial tension of the <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> were analysed. The results show a marginal potential of enhanced oil recovery by low salinity injection (less than 2 %OOIP). No fines or pH variation were observed during low salinity injection. The low potential of low salinity was suggested {{to be related to}} the small clay content and insufficient wettability alteration in the Bentheimer sandstone cores. Combination of low salinity and surfactant injection resulted in significant increase in oil recovery (additional 26 % OOIP). The effect of temperature gave lower recovery at 90 °C. A reduction in pH was also observed, suggesting hydrolysis of the surfactant at elevated temperature. Despite the insignificant response to low salinity brine, a combination with a surfactant may be more beneficial both to increase oil recovery and to be more economically than low salinity brine and surfactant flooding alone...|$|E
40|$|The Coalbed Methane (CBM) {{generated}} by coal {{is located in}} coal pores and the drainage of the coalbed gas to the production well is made through the so-called "cleat system", i. e., the natural fracture network of coal. This justifies the classic method of CBM production by providing fracture-stimulation with fluids under pressure to open coal natural fractures. However, natural fracturing system of any coal is very complex, depending on coalification process and local and regional tectonics. Additionally, the cleat network cannot be inferred using conventional regional micro-tectonics studies. Therefore, what really matters is to know, in each case, the spatial orientation of the different classes of fracturing, ordered by connectivity frequencies, to make possible an orientated injection of fluids to open the cleat permitting higher amounts of gas release/drainage. In fact, the cleat family of highest connectivity frequency {{is the one that}} define the gas circulation network to the producing well, and consequently the most favorable one to be opened by <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> in the correct direction. The current investigation refers to a new and innovative proposal to develop a method for determining cleat family orientation in the space, ordered by cleat connectivity frequency. This new semi-automatic method is based in the study of "cleat characteristics" by image analysis in orientated core samples of boreholes for CBM prospection/exploration.

40|$|AbstractAnnular {{cementing}} is {{an essential}} step in well construction in underground CO 2 storage projects. The quality of cementing depends {{on the quality of}} mud displacement by the <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> into the annulus during the cementing job. An engineering numerical model of annular fluid displacement in a vertical well was used in this study to investigate the effect of well profile on the displacement quality. Annular displacement of the thinner fluid in place by the injected thicker fluid was modelled. The effect of the following factors on the displacement was studied: slightly irregular shape of the well cross-section; eccentric positioning of the casing in a circular well; a local washout (enlargement of the well cross-section); throughgoing breakouts. Random irregularities of the well cross-section were found to have only a minor effect on the advancement of the displacement front and on the injection pressure. Eccentric positioning of the casing pipe was found to cause flow channelization due to the yield-stress rheology of the fluids. The eccentricity was found to affect the injection pressure as well. An isolated washout was found to have only a minor influence on the injection pressure and the displacement front propagation. Borehole breakouts were found to cause severe channelization of the injected fluid, and a substantial reduction in the injection pressure. Continuous enlargements of the annulus caused e. g. by borehole breakouts or eccentric positioning of the casing were thus shown to have a more detrimental effect on the annular displacement than a local, isolated enlargement caused e. g. by a washout. Abnormally low injection pressure during a cementing job might serve as an indication of flow channelization through such a throughgoing enlargement...|$|E

The traditional polymers are usually sensitive to high salinity, especially at high temperature. However, injection of low-salinity make-up brines may precondition high-salinity reservoirs before initiating polymer flooding which may reduce chemical degradation of polymer. This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide base polymer for mobility control application in a low-salinity preconditioned carbonate reservoir and hence on the improvement of oil recovery at HTHS carbonate reservoir. Core flooding experiments using unsteady-state technique were conducted on reservoir cores with permeability range of 10 – 100 mD. During each experiments, salinity of the make-up brines were changed to study the effect of preflush salinity and polymer {{flooding in}} HTHS reservoir. Oil production from water flooding for all the cases was found to be between 49 and 65 %. Polymer helped to reduce the mobility ratio from 4.1 to less than 1 and additional 7 – 11 % of oil was recovered from the remaining oil saturation after water flooding. Comparisons were also made between oil recovery results based on volumetric production and in situ saturation monitoring (ISSM) data, which were found to be matching. Additionally, the ISSM helped to understand the performances of <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> during oil recovery stages and captured front movement of the fluids at all time.

As chitinases are commonly expressed in plants against plant pathogens, the chitinase derived from the teratocytes of T. nigriceps is a potential tool {{for the development of}} insect pest control methods based on the disruption of the perithrophic membrane of herbivores. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the activity of the putative chitinase from teratocytes of T. nigriceps (Tnchi) produced using the Escherichia coli expression system and its potential to control H. virescens larvae when expressed into transgenic tobacco plants. The purified E. coli-produced Tnchi protein showed no chitinolitic activity, but was active in binding with colloidal and crystalline chitins in water and with colloidal chitin in buffered solution (pH = 6. 74). Transgenic tobacco plants showed no enhanced chitinolitic activity relative to control plants, but survival of three-day old larvae of H. virescens was severely affected when directly fed on transgenic tobacco leaves expressing the recombinant Tnchi protein. Some properties of the Tnchi protein and the potential use of Tnchi-transgenic plants to control plant pests are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Amendment {{solutions}} with {{or without}} surfactants {{have been used to}} remove contaminants from soil. However, it has drawbacks such that the amendment solution often mobilizes the plume, and its movement is controlled by gravity and preferential flow paths. Foam is an emulsion-like, two-phase system in which gas cells are dispersed in a liquid and separated by thin liquid films called lamellae. Potential advantages of using foams in sub-surface remediation include providing better control on the volume of <b>fluids</b> <b>injected,</b> uniformity of contact, and the ability to contain the migration of contaminant laden liquids. It is expected that foam can serve as a carrier of amendments for vadose zone remediation, e. g., at the Hanford Site. As part of the U. S. Department of Energy’s EM- 20 program, a numerical simulation capability will be added to the Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases (STOMP) flow simulator. The primary purpose of this document is to review the modeling approaches of foam transport in porous media. However, as an aid to understanding the simulation approaches, some experiments under unsaturated conditions and the processes of foam transport are also reviewed. Foam may be formed when the surfactant concentration is above the critical micelle concentration. There are two main types of foams – the ball foam (microfoam) and the polyhedral foam. The characteristics of bulk foam are described by the properties such as foam quality, texture, stability, density, surface tension, disjoining pressure, etc. Foam has been used to flush contaminants such as metals, organics, and nonaqueous phase liquids from unsaturated soil. Ball foam, or colloidal gas aphrons, reportedly have been used for soil flushing in contaminated site remediation and was found to be more efficient than surfactant solutions on the basis of weight of contaminant removed per gram of surfactant. Experiments also indicate that the polyhedral foam can be used to enhance soil remediation. The transport of foam in porous media is complicated in that the number of lamellae present governs flow characteristics such as viscosity, relative permeability, fluid distribution, and interactions between fluids. Hence, foam is a non-Newtonian fluid. During transport, foam destruction and formation occur. The net result of the two processes determines the foam texture (i. e., bubble density). Some of the foam may be trapped during transport. According to the impacts of the aqueous and gas flow rates, foam flow generally has two regimes – weak and strong foam. There is also a minimum pressure gradient to initiate foam flow and a critical capillary for foam to be sustained. Similar to other fluids, the transport of foam is described by Darcy’s law with the exception that the foam viscosity is variable. Three major approaches to modeling foam transport in porous media are the empirical, semi-empirical, and mechanistic methods. Mechanistic approaches can be complete in principal but may be difficult to obtain reliable parameters, whereas empirical and semi-empirical approaches can be limited by the detail used to describe foam rheology and mobility. Mechanistic approaches include the bubble population-balance model, the network/percolation theory, the catastrophe theory, and the filtration theory. Among these methods, all were developed for modeling polyhedral foam with the exception that the method based on the filtration theory was for the ball foam (microfoam) ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} global demand for crude oil, {{it is essential}} to increase the oil production in economic ways. This requires a significant increase in application of advanced technologies in this area. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes are known as series of different advanced technologies, which can be used to increase the oil production from a given oil reservoir. The traditional use of polymers in EOR is almost limited to increasing viscosity of the aqueous <b>fluids</b> <b>injected</b> into the reservoir. By increasing the viscosity of the injected fluids, more areas of the reservoir can be swept, and therefore more oil is expected to be recovered. In this thesis proposal, a number of advanced polymer applications for EOR are investigated. Polymers are known as a very promising class of materials with wide range of properties, especially combined with other advanced materials, such as nanoparticles. Therefore, there is a huge potential for developing new application of polymers in EOR processes. The first application introduced in this thesis is to use polymers as sacrificial adsorption agents for anionic surfactants. In a subclass of EOR, known as chemical EOR, surfactants are injected to lower the interfacial tension of oil and brine, resulting in recovery of more oil. However, one of the challenges facing these processes is the adsorption of surfactants onto the reservoir rock, which requires excessive injection of surfactant to compensate for the adsorption. This significantly increases the cost of the chemical EOR to values much more than what is actually needed for oil recovery. In second chapter of this thesis, sodium polyacrylate is introduced as a sacrificial adsorption agent, a chemical that is injected to decrease the adsorption of anionic surfactant. The results show that the material cost of chemical EOR can be reduced by up to 80 % in case of using polyacrylate as a sacrificial agent for anionic surfactants. In addition, application of polyacrylate as a sacrificial agent for zwitterionic surfactants was investigated. In spite the significant reduction seen in the adsorption of anionic surfactants once polyacrylate is used, adsorption of zwitterionic surfactants is only slightly reduced after adding polyacrylate. In order to understand the reasons behind this dismal reduction, the effect of pH on adsorption of lauryl betaine (as the zwitterionic surfactant in this study) is studied. Based on the experimental data, a hypothetic mechanism is introduced to explain the adsorption properties of betaine. This hypothetic mechanism also explains why polyacrylate shows a very slight reduction in adsorption of zwitterionic surfactants while it significantly reduces adsorption of anionic surfactants. Finally, the effect of polymer coating on interfacial properties of nanoparticles in the absence or presence of surfactants is studied. Interfacial properties of polymer-coated nanoparticles in EOR have been traditionally limited to only emulsions (Pickering Emulsions). In this thesis, we have provided experimental evidence that polymer-coated nanoparticles can migrate to micro-emulsion phases {{even in the absence of}} emulsions. Some of these polymer-coated nanoparticles are dispersed in aqueous solutions, but they will precipitate in the micro-emulsion phase once mixed with the oil. This observation by itself can be used in EOR applications through understanding the fact that aqueous stability of nanoparticles is not the sufficient condition for nanoparticles to remain stable when injected into oil reservoirs. Many previous researchers have only focused on stability of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions as the only requirement for stability of nanoparticles even after injection into oil reservoir. This assumption is challenged based on our work in this thesis...|$|E
