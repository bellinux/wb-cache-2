5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of travel {{literature}} and gazetteers which prevailed in the 19th century, and which include information on nearby Cardigan, the growing resort of Gwbert (across the estuary), and the Abbey at St. Dogmaels, they fail to record any beach <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seems it did not become known as a resort until later in the 20th century.|$|E

The people of Ballyclare and the surrounding villages played a part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and fought in the Battle of Antrim. At the beginning of the 20th century Ballyclare was a growing industrial town with an urban district council and became the largest paper producer in Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{received}} a mixed response. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode an 8/10, stating [...] "A lot was in play <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> a well executed episode. They play on our expectation that Kenny would die, Mr. Garrison's cowardice, Cartman's troublemaking and Butters' steadfast {{compliance with the}} rules. There's {{a lot of fun}} stuff <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> a cool way to wrap up the 'half season' before we get new episodes in the fall". However, Josh Modell of The A.V. Club graded the episode a C+, stating [...] "It was okay. Not great, not horrible. Funny, but not hilarious. There was a noticeable lack of proselytizing, which can be a good or a bad thing".|$|R

25|$|The mid-1970s {{were the}} heydey of the World Touring Car Championships. Competitors of Jaguar like Ford and BMW had seen success <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was a logical {{progression}} for Jaguar {{to try their}} hand at it too. For the 1976 season, British Leyland contracted James Broad and his tuning and engineering outfit, Broadspeed Engineering, a firm which had seen previous success racing Minis and Ford Capris around Europe. Broad saw potential in Jaguar’s then flagship coupe, the XJ12C. This {{led to the development}} of the car you see here – the , which has popped up at Duncan Hamilton for sale.|$|E

Marie, and not accessible by road. The Algoma Central developed a tourist stopover <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> proved to be a great success for the railway. Owing to the popularity of the Agawa Canyon excursions, the Algoma Central would run the longest passenger trains in North America, often up to 20 to 24 cars long. During the 1970s and 1980s, around 100,000 people per year would tour Agawa Canyon.|$|E

25|$|The Javanese kakawin Tantu Pagelaran {{explained}} the mythical {{origin of the}} island and its volcanic nature. Four major cultural areas exist on the island: the kejawen or Javanese heartland, the north coast of the pasisir region, the Sunda lands of West Java, and the eastern salient, also known as Blambangan.

25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region that they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

[...] The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, [...] "Zesh is certainly not signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will be great to have him on board."

500|$|Later reviews {{were also}} complimentary. VanDerWerff gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a {{good example of the}} show heading in a {{different}} direction but still largely feeling like the same show." [...] He praised the episode for being [...] "fun [...] creepy". VanDerWerff also praised the final scene, noting that [...] "rare that Mulder and Scully completely get played, but they do <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> makes the episode an even better sick joke." [...] Ultimately, he praised the [...] "sick sense of humor", the [...] "outright left turns into demented darkness", and [...] "the horrifying visuals". Shearman and Pearson awarded the episode five stars out of five, citing the [...] "very good" [...] conceit about organized religion, the humor, and the [...] "great set pieces" [...] as positive factors.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F.

Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was given}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according}} to Metacritic. Several reviews praised {{the amount of}} value that Metroid Prime Hunters offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. GameZone considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. The Toronto Sun remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and The Press called Metroid Prime Hunters the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. The Australian agreed that the graphics are [...] "outstanding" [...] and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and The Independent asserted that Metroid Prime Hunters was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. GamePros review stated that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine how}} Nintendo squeezed Hunters into a tiny DS cartridge." [...] Despite a few [...] "small quirks", the magazine noted that Hunters [...] "is a very polished game". The Times concurred with these claims, remarking, [...] "A lot of thought has clearly gone into making the most of the DS's touch-screen capability <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> works gloriously." ...|$|E
