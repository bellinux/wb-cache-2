40|$|International @ CDFA+DLJ:PFOInternational audienceThe {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} has <b>heightened</b> <b>research</b> <b>efforts</b> to find environmentally-friendly alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals, thereby, the production of biodiesel has increased significantly [1]. The manufacture of biodiesel lead to different co-products, among them is glycerol (GLY), which represent 10 wt. % of the final product. For this reason, the transformation of GLY in valuable chemicals (glyceric acid, glycolic acid, formic acid,etc) has gained a great interest [2]. Among the different transformation techniques, the catalytic oxidation, as a non-expensive and environmentally-friendly process, is the most developed. There are many studies which deal the kinetic analysis and modelling of the GLY oxidation. However, it is still necessary to further investigate this reaction to explain some aspects which are not clarified so far. This way, {{the aim of this}} work is to perform a kinetic modelling of the GLY oxidation. A kinetic model will be proposed by using the experimental results reported in a previous work of our groups [3] carried out in kinetic regime and a carbonbalance close to 100 %. FIG 1 shows the reaction pathways selected for the preliminary kinetic analysis, by analysis of experimental results reported previously [3] where C- 1 (formic), C- 2 (glycolic) and C- 3 (glyceric) acids have been found as primary products. Direct C-C cleavage into small acids was already reported in previous studies [4]. The first kinetic model has been proposed on formal approach, by considering first-reaction order of all components. For the parameter estimation, non-linear regression was performed by using Matlab. Finally, a statistical analysis of the estimated parameters was performed by the calculation of the standard deviations and the correlation matrix. Obtained rate constants at different reaction temperatures are listed in FIG 2, along with a comparison of the calculated and experimental concentrations for the Au-catalysed reaction at 100 °C. Results revealed that the Au catalyst was active and selective towards formic and tartronic acids, and the activation energies obtained were similar than those reported elsewhere [5]. In general, the concentrations predicted with the kinetic model fittedadequately with the experimental ones. However, statistical analysis results (not shown) revealed a strong correlation between different rate constants. Therefore, the model will be improved by the incorporation of further parameters that could influence the activity of the process, such as the base concentration, the reaction orders {{and in the case of}} the Au-catalysed reactions, the adsorption constants of the GLY and the obtained products. Moreover, the reaction mechanism will be further analysed by additional experiments of competitive reactions...|$|E

The increase in meta-taxonomic comparative analyses on birds underlines the need to better address how <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is distributed in this class. Methods {{have been developed to}} choose which species should be studied to obtain unbiased comparative data sets, but a precise and global knowledge of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is required to be able to properly apply them. We address this issue by providing a data set of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> (number of papers from 1978 to 2008 in the Zoological Record database) estimates for the 10 064 species of birds. We then test whether <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is associated with phylogeny, geography and eleven different life history and ecological traits. We show that phylogeny accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} variance, while geographic range and all the tested traits are also significant contributors to <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> variance. We identify avian taxa that are under- and overstudied and address the importance of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> biases in evaluating vulnerability to extinction, with non-threatened species studied twice as much as threatened ones. Our <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> data set covering the entire class Aves provides a tool for researchers to incorporate this potential confounding variable in comparative analyses...|$|R

The two types of efforts complement each other and positively influence the payoff of the contest. We assume that legal effort affects the prize value, increasing the winner’s prospective rents, and <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> impacts the probability of winning the contest. The results of the model break new ground in showing that <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is a function of legal <b>effort,</b> wherein <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> increases with rent-seeking effort.
