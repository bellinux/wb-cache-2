50|$|Psychoanalytic {{theories}} incriminate authoritarian or distant attitudes by one (mainly the mother) or both parents, {{along with}} conditional love based on expectations {{the child can}} never fully meet. Using psychoanalysis, Freud believed that lustfulness was a projection of the patient's lack of ability to love unconditionally and develop cognitively to maturity, and that such patients were overall emotionally shallow.He believed the reason for being unable to love could have resulted from a traumatic experience, such as {{the death of a}} close relative during childhood or divorce of one's parents, which gave the wrong impression of committed relationships. Exposure to one or multiple traumatic occurrences of a close friend or family member's leaving (via abandonment or mortality) would make the person unable to <b>form</b> <b>true</b> and affectionate <b>attachments</b> towards other people.|$|R

Critics {{have pointed out that}} Trollope's view of Ireland separates him from many of the other Victorian novelists. Some critics claim that Ireland did not influence Trollope as much as his experience in England, and that the society in Ireland harmed him as a writer, especially since Ireland was experiencing the Great Famine during his time there. Such critics were dismissed as holding bigoted opinions against Ireland and failing to recognise Trollope's <b>true</b> <b>attachment</b> to the country.|$|R

5000|$|Based on autobiographical {{elements}} which {{constitute a}} kind of encyclopaedic view of Bernhard's world, this book gives a rare insight into {{the birth of a}} remarkable literary oeuvre paralleling that of Kafka and of Beckett. In fact, Sophie Wilkins, in her Afterword, compares it to Kafka's short story [...] "Description of a Struggle". Written as one sentence, it is a monologue delivered by a court reporter who meets a variety of characters, among whom are a secondary school teacher - the only intellectual - an innkeeper, and various ladies who afford him favours or bully and humiliate him. His only <b>true</b> <b>attachment</b> is to his filthy dog. The dog is a dirty, smelly body detested by the housekeeper who wants him and his owner out, but it's precisely this indubitable physical reality of him that makes him indispensable; without it, there's no real life in his life, and therewith no ideas, no literature that means anything.|$|R
