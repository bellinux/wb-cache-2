40|$|Pipejacking is {{a tunnel}} {{construction}} technique which is increasing in popularity, but fundamental research {{is necessary to}} fully understand the extent of its possible uses and limitations. This dissertation reports on laboratory research into the performance of reinforced concrete pipes, assessment of pipe joints {{and the use of}} <b>joint</b> <b>packing</b> materials. The research has addressed specific problems which the tunnelling fraternity have raised. Model pipes have been constructed at scales of 1 : 6 and 1 : 10. 5 using reinforced microconcrete and they have been tested in either a sand filled chamber or between supporting yokes. Current British Standard tests have been used as a control on the quality of pipe manufacture. Data have been recorded of changes in soil pressures, pipe geometry and strains induced in the pipes. The tests have investigated deformation of pipes, deflection angles between consecutive pipes, distribution of stress concentrations and the effects of the use of <b>joint</b> <b>packing</b> materials on allowable jacking loads and induced stress magnitudes in the pipes. A review of current pipejacking practice is presented and recommendations for the control and supervision of pipejacking operations are made. The conclusions include recommendations for fieldwork monitoring and implications of this stage of the research to industry. Recommendations are made for maximum installation jacking loads for any given deflection angle between pipes. The prediction of friction angles at the pipe soil interface have been assessed at different soil stress levels and new recommendations are made. The effects of cyclic loading on the pipejacking system and transfer from jacking load to ground loading once the pipes are installed are presented. The criteria used in the selection of a recommended <b>joint</b> <b>packing</b> material for use in jacking operations have been included. Failure modes of pipes are stated and recommendations are made for pipe design, installation and monitoring to predict and prevent such failures. This dissertation is the report on the first stage of an overall programme of research which is now set to progress with monitoring of pipejacking operations on several construction sites...|$|E

Thompson to build the bridge for $208 ($ in contemporary dollars). He employed construction techniques dating to the early 18th century, in which the abutments were built first on a small span, followed by a temporary wooden centering to support the arch. Its interior would be filled with earth or stone, and often waterproofed with coal tar or mortar {{on the inside of the}} stonework. On the exterior <b>joints</b> <b>packed</b> as tightly as possible prior to mortaring. The centering would be left in place until the mortar had completely set, which could take weeks.|$|R

30|$|The first crack {{occurred}} at the dry <b>pack</b> <b>joint</b> at about 100 kN. The steel bars joining the two panels started undergoing the bar dowel action. This occurred in two stages, namely bar bending and kinking actions (West et al. 1993; Soudki 1994).|$|R
40|$|Randomly packed {{particles}} in granular matter, ubiquitous {{in nature and}} industry, usually defy simple predictions for the optimal amorphous packing density because jammed granules are strongly correlated. While mixing different granular shapes {{seems to be a}} further complication, we discovered in simulations that binary rod– sphere mixtures harbor a surprisingly simple dependence of packing volume fraction on mixture composition. This isochoric ideality covers the entire composition range and is experimentally validated by mixtures of sphero-cylindrical TicTac sweets and spherical beads: their <b>joint</b> random <b>packing</b> volume is indeed independent of the segregation state. Isochoric ideality occurs in a rod–shape range that includes the unique aspect ratio, which universally maximizes rod–sphere packing densities and suggests a novel amorphous analog of a plastic crystal, namely rod–sphere mixtures with completely uncorrelated particle orientations...|$|R

60|$|As we {{came down}} through the town we {{encountered}} a squad of little donkeys ready saddled for use. The saddles were peculiar, to say the least. They consisted of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it, and this furniture covered about half the donkey. There were no stirrups, but really such supports were not needed--to use such a saddle was the next thing to riding a dinner table--there was ample support clear out to one's knee <b>joints.</b> A <b>pack</b> of ragged Portuguese muleteers crowded around us, offering their beasts at half a dollar an hour--more rascality to the stranger, for the market price is sixteen cents. Half a dozen of us mounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making a ridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a town of 10,000 inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|The calcaneocuboid joint was {{studied in}} ligamentous {{specimens}} of ten human feet, and in skeletons of two gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei), six chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), three orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and 25 human feet. The {{movement of the}} transverse tarsal joint was further studied in a living foot on a walk-way with a glass plate inserted, and with an underlying mirror. In man the joint is shaped as an asymmetrical sector of one end of an hour-glass shaped surface of revolution with its main axis oriented longitudinally in the foot. The calcaneocuboid <b>joint</b> becomes close <b>packed</b> by a pronation of the forefoot {{in relation to the}} hind foot because of a congruency between the joint surfaces obtained in this position and because the calcaneus overhangs the cuboid dorsally and stops the movement. At low gear push off the foot is inverted and the calcaneocuboid <b>joint</b> loose <b>packed.</b> The stresses are absorbed across the fibular, postaxial border of the foot. At high high gear push off there is a functional pronation of the forefoot with a stabilization of the transverse tarsal joint and a more effective tightening of the plantar aponeurosis. The foot becomes a rigid lever for propulsion. In contrast to the human condition, the anthropoid calcaneus has an anteromedial extension associated with symmetry of the calcaneocuboid joint. The calcaneus does not overhang the cuboid and {{there appears to be no}} close packed position. Correspondingly, the anthropoid foot has a mid-tarsal break at each push off in addition to the metatarsophalangeal break...|$|R
30|$|The {{incremental}} {{lateral load}} was {{imposed by the}} hydraulic jack (Brand: Enerpac, Capacity: 500 kN) at the dry <b>pack</b> <b>joint</b> and at 1800  mm height from the joint for shear and flexural tests, respectively. The experiment started with a load-controlled mode where readings were taken at every 10 kN load increment. Then, as the specimen yielded and a large displacement was detected, the displacement-controlled mode was used. Readings were taken at every 2  mm displacement. This was {{in order to obtain}} a smooth load–displacement curve.|$|R
2500|$|DARthroplasty (dorsal {{acetabular}} rim arthroplasty) is {{a technique}} developed by Dr. Barclay Slocum and Theresa Devine Slocum whereby cortico-cancellous bone strips, taken from the iliac crest, are contoured over the femoral head and sutured to the dorsal hip <b>joint</b> capsule and <b>packed</b> with additional cancellous bone graft dorsally to eventually anchor to drill holes in the original dorsal acetabulum. The new [...] "shelf" [...] eventually becomes {{an extension of the}} original acetabulum, thereby providing support and eliminating subluxation of the hip joint. The joint capsule becomes the new joint surface.|$|R
30|$|The grouted splice {{connections}} are not practical for resisting shear load as the usable capacity was too low, {{which was about}} 1 / 3 of the ultimate capacity. Although the connection was able to withstand a high shear strength of about 300 kN, the bar dower action caused the connection to lose elasticity at about 100 kN. Unless it is integrated with another mechanism that is more effective in resisting shear load, such as shear keys at the dry <b>pack</b> <b>joint</b> (Rizkalla et al. 1989), the connection can only be designed at 1 / 3 of its ultimate capacity.|$|R
50|$|Each hull has two pylons (the forward {{ones are}} vented {{to allow the}} {{pressure}} inside the hull to equalise) and the frame fits onto these pylons. The frame consists of four aluminium alloy beams which slot into four aluminium alloy corner castings and are secured with rivets. The trampoline slots along {{the inside of the}} beams and is tensioned by rope or shock cord. Racers commonly epoxy the beams into the castings to boost rigidity because the flexing of the boat as it rides over waves saps power. Equally, the <b>joints</b> may be <b>packed</b> with aluminium sheet cut from drink cans; this method facilitates disassembly.|$|R
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal said Russian {{forces had}} {{seized control of}} Poti on the morning, which is the {{economically}} significant port. Georgian soldiers in Poti were captured by the Russian forces and taken to the base in Senaki four hours later. The Russians also captured five American jeeps. Later, American Humvees moved {{down the road to}} Abkhazia. A top Russian military official claimed that armed Georgian soldiers in Poti were driving the Humvees and were detained at a checkpoint, however the Georgians said that 21 Georgian soldiers were guarding the port from looting, and that American Humvees used in a <b>joint</b> exercise were <b>packed</b> in a container to be shipped back to the United States. An Azerbaijani news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, [...] "All workers were expelled from the port [...] ".|$|R
40|$|AbstractJoint formation, {{the onset}} of which is {{characterized}} by the segmentation of continuous skeletal rudiments into two or more separate elements, is a fundamental aspect of limb pattern formation, playing a critical role in determining the size, shape, and number of individual skeletal elements. Joint formation is initiated by conversion of differentiated chondrocytes at sites of presumptive <b>joints</b> into densely <b>packed</b> nonchondrogenic cells of the joint interzone. This conversion is accompanied by loss of Alcian blue-staining cartilage matrix and downregulation of cartilage-specific gene expression. Here, we report that Cux 1, which encodes a transcription factor containing a homeodomain and other DNA-binding motifs, is highly expressed at all of the discrete sites of incipient joint formation in the developing limb concomitant with conversion of differentiated chondrocytes into interzone tissue. Moreover, differentiated limb chondrocytes in micromass cultures infected with a Cux 1 retroviral expression vector are converted into nonchondrogenic cells which exhibit loss of Alcian blue cartilage matrix and downregulation of cartilage-specific gene expression as occurs at {{the onset of}} normal joint formation. These results suggest that Cux 1 is involved in regulating the onset of joint formation by facilitating conversion of chondrocytes into nonchondrogenic cells of the interzone...|$|R
50|$|On November 19, 2004, Novalogic {{released}} an expansion <b>pack,</b> <b>Joint</b> Operations: Escalation. The expansion pack {{was not a}} stand-alone release and required the original game be installed first prior to use. Escalation introduced new maps, weapons, and vehicles to the original game while focusing on an escalation of the conflict in Indonesia {{to the rest of}} Southeast Asia. Players had the option to use parachutes to jump out of helicopters or from elevated map locations. The parachute deployed automatically after a player had fallen long enough to reach terminal velocity. The parachute could be steered, but with a response slower than normal movement. After a player landed, the parachute was expended and no longer operable unless the player went to an armory to pick up a new one. Players also had the option of carrying body armor. The body armor would not deflect rounds, but spread out their kinetic energy, reducing the penetrative force. Similar to the parachute, body armor added weight which slowed a player's speed on foot. To counter this, players also had the option of choosing what type of bullets they could use. FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets were for general use. SP (Soft Point) bullets caused more damage to enemies but could be greatly reduced by body armor. Consequently, AP (Armor Piercing) bullets could pierce body armor but did not cause as much damage as the former choices. Other new items included attack choppers, motorcycles, anti-vehicle mines and guided anti-tank missile launchers.|$|R
