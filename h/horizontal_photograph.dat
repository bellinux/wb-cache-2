5000|$|Zhang Zeduan was {{a notable}} painter for his {{horizontal}} Along the River During Qingming Festival landscape and cityscape painting. It has been quoted as [...] "China's Mona Lisa" [...] {{and has had}} many well-known remakes throughout Chinese history. Other famous paintings include The Night Revels of Han Xizai, originally painted by the Southern Tang artist Gu Hongzhong in the 10th century, while the well-known version of his painting is a 12th-century remake of the Song dynasty. This is a large horizontal handscroll of a domestic scene showing men of the gentry class being entertained by musicians and dancers while enjoying food, beverage, and wash basins provided by maidservants. In 2000, the modern artist Wang Qingsong created a parody of this painting with a long, <b>horizontal</b> <b>photograph</b> of people in modern clothing making similar facial expressions, poses, and hand gestures as the original painting.|$|E

40|$|The urban {{structure}} and equipments can restrict the correct development {{of trees and}} its typical architecture. Tipuana tipu (Benth.) O. Kuntze (rosewood) has been pruned continuously for being a species of large size and for being the most planted tree {{in the city of}} Curitiba. Because of that, this work aimed to assess the changes in the typical architecture of Tipuana tipu on street trees of Curitiba through completely randomized design containing a check plot composed by 6 trees and a treatment with 6 trees under utility lines and another with 6 trees in streets without utility lines. From <b>horizontal</b> <b>photographs</b> of trees there were obtained dendrometric variables based on a metric scale attached at DBH. Thus, the morphometric indexes were calculated to describe dimensional relationships for the species on trees without pruning (check plot) and on pruned trees (treatments). The results showed that raising pruning change typical architecture of rosewood modifying its outline and its form, in addition to harm its aesthetic effect. The indexes that can express changes significantly (p< 0. 05), were: range index, salience index, crown angle, crown proportion and relation RH/PH...|$|R

50|$|The Interservices Topographical Department (ISTD) {{came out}} of the near-fiasco of the British {{invasion}} of Norway (April 9 - May 9, 1940). Prior to that time, the Army and Royal Navy had different intelligence units that were independent of each other. The ISTD was established at Manchester College, Oxford. Working together with members of each arm and the Allies, this unit was able to bring together zero-elevation aerial photography, which is phototgraphy taken as close to the wave tops as possible, in order to bring the views of the beach landscape, which were then made into continuous <b>horizontal</b> strip <b>photographs.</b> These files were marked with military targets such as bridges, marshalling yards and the like, and up-to-date photos and intelligence were used to up date obsolete maps. From these new maps, and from older maps, magazine illustrations, and old family photographs taken on holiday collected from the public, new maps could be produced for the planning staffs and operations forces.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Background: Late-onset Tay–Sachs disease (LOTS) is an adult-onset, {{autosomal}} recessive, progressive {{variant of}} GM 2 gangliosidosis, characterized by {{involvement of the}} cerebellum and anterior horn cells. Objective: To determine the range of visual and ocular motor abnormalities in LOTS, {{as a prelude to}} evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies. Methods: Fourteen patients with biochemically confirmed LOTS (8 men; age range 24 to 53 years; disease duration 5 to 30 years) and 10 age-matched control subjects were studied. Snellen visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, stereop-sis, and visual fields were measured, and optic fundi were <b>photographed.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> and vertical eye movements (search coil) were recorded, and saccades, pursuit, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), vergence, and optokinetic (OK) responses were measured. Results: All patients showed normal visual functions and optic fundi. The main eye movement abnormality concerned saccades, which were “multistep, ” consisting of a series of small saccades and larger movements that showed transient decelerations. Larger saccades ended earlier and more abruptly (greater peak deceleration) in LOTS patients than in control subjects; these changes can be attributed to premature termination of the saccadic pulse. Smooth-pursuit and slow-phase OK gains were reduced, but VOR, vergence, and gaze holding were normal. Conclusions: Patients with late-onset Tay–Sachs disease (LOTS) show characteristic abnormalities of saccades but normal afferent visual systems. Hypometria, transient decelerations, and premature termination of saccades suggest disruption of a “latch circuit ” that normally inhibits pontine omnipause neurons, permitting burst neurons to discharge until the eye movement is com...|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} size {{of fruit}} tree with focal length of lens, plane accuracy and depth accuracy of stereo photogrammatry (SP) were calculated at several resolutions of digital image to examine possibility of measuring fruit trees by SP. As the results, throughout a tree crown of any case, the plane accuracy did not exceed several mm, {{and the depth}} accuracy did not several decade mm. A focal length of lens was searched by combining these results with possible <b>photographing</b> <b>horizontal</b> distance in each orchard where each size of fruit trees are planted at its highest density. Following methods were effective for SP; upward photographing using a standard tripod, two sheet pile of net to prevent hail as the back and hand-held type of control point (GCP) set. Orientation succeeded at 100 %, when these upward photographs were put in the same coordinate system as aerial photogrammatry. The measurement errors in X and Y coordinates from the simple modeling method were very small. But, calculated values of Z coordinate and the measured values were clearly left from the 1 : 1 line. As a correction method of the Z coordinates, linear regression equations using the calculated values of the GCP data against the measured ones were effective. In most characters of cherry branches, the calculated values from SP and the measured ones were on their 1 : 1 lines. For the five cherry trees with different sizes, the measurement errors decreased by the correction method using wide-angle lenses. 　キーワード：立体写真測量，果樹，樹形，枝形，測量精度　Key Words : stereo photogrammetry，fruit trees, tree form, branch form, measurement erro...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity and}} reliability of photographic examinations for developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in maxillary and mandibular incisors and canines using a standardized process. Methods: The anterior teeth of 257 children were examined 'wet', both clinically and photographically for DDE, using the modified Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) (DDE) Index. A series of five standardized photographs were taken for each child: a frontal view perpendicular to the four incisors; two lateral views, each showing the lateral incisors and canines {{on each side of}} the dental arch; and the superior and inferior views, retaking of the frontal view with the camera held at approximately 30 °above and below the <b>horizontal</b> plane. The <b>photographs</b> taken for each child were viewed as three different sets; the 'five-view' (frontal, two lateral views plus superior and inferior views), 'three-view' (frontal and two lateral views), and 'one-view' (frontal view only) slide sets. Results: Using 'one view' slides, 91. 7 % of teeth could be examined photographically. Whereas using multiple views 99. 9 % of teeth could be assessed. At the subject level, agreements between clinical diagnoses (gold standard) and photographic examinations were substantial to almost perfect (k = 0. 73 - 0. 86). At the tooth level, agreement was best for incisors (k = 0. 71 or higher). The intra-examiner reproducibility was high for the photographic assessments at both subject and tooth levels (k = 0. 71 - 0. 95). Conclusions: Multiple-view photographic slides of 'five-view' and 'three-view' are valid and reliable for assessing DDE on the 12 anterior teeth, while a 'one-view' (frontal) was acceptable to study only the incisors. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} flow {{orientation}} on {{critical heat flux}} (CHF) {{on a series of}} nine in-line simulated microelectronic chips in Fluorinert FC- 72 were investigated. The chips were subjected to coolant in upflow, downflow, or horizontal flow with the chips on the top or bottom walls of the channel with respect to gravity. Changes in angle of orientation affected CHF for velocities below 200 cm/s, with some chips reaching CHF at heat fluxes below the pool boiling and flooding-induced CHF values. Increased subcooling was found to slightly dampen this adverse effect of orientation. Critical heat flux was overwhelmingly caused by localized dryout of the chip surface. However, during the low velocity downflow tests, low CHF values were measured because of liquid blockage by vapor counterflow and vapor stagnation in the channel. At the horizontal orientation with downward-facing chips, vapor/liquid stratification also yielded low CHF values. Previously derived correlations for water and long, continuous heaters had limited success in predicting CHF for the present discontinuous heater configuration. Because orientation has a profound effect on the hydrodynamics of two-phase flow and, consequently, on CHF for small inlet velocities, it is shown that downflow angles should be avoided, or when other constraints force the usage of downflow angles, the inlet liquid velocity should be sufficiently large. ^ A critical heat flux model is presented that accounts for both heater length and orientation effects in near-saturated flow. Formulation of the model was based on flow visualization and photomicrography of the vapor-liquid interface on 10, 30, and 110 -mm long heaters subjected to vertical, inclined, and <b>horizontal</b> flow. The <b>photographs</b> revealed the formation of a wavy vapor layer on the heater prior to CHF with surface wetting occurring at the wave troughs. The distance between these troughs increased in the stream-wise direction causing a {{reduction in the number of}} wetting fronts available for liquid replenishment of the heated surface. Lift off of the most upstream wetting front was found to catastrophically cause CHF. The model predicts the CHF data with a mean absolute error of 14. 6 %. ...|$|R
