5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and <b>external</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E

25|$|The barrier {{was only}} {{overcome}} {{with the arrival}} of DOS extenders, which allowed DOS applications to run in extended memory, but these were not very widely used outside the computer game area. As games began to use digital sound and digital image textures, they performed better if these large data components could be preloaded into megabytes of memory before playing the game rather than constantly loading the data from <b>external</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{constructing}} a linked list, one {{is faced with}} the choice of whether to store the data of the list directly in the linked list nodes, called internal storage, or merely to store {{a reference to the}} data, called <b>external</b> <b>storage.</b> Internal storage has the advantage of making access to the data more efficient, requiring less storage overall, having better locality of reference, and simplifying memory management for the list (its data is allocated and deallocated {{at the same time as}} the list nodes).|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to long-term page fixing is moving the entire application, including all its data buffers, to a preferred area of main storage. This {{is accomplished by}} a special SYSEVENT in MVS/370 through z/OS operating systems, wherein the application is, first, swapped-out from wherever it may be, presumably from a non-preferred area, to swap and page <b>external</b> <b>storage,</b> and is, second, swapped-in to a preferred area (SYSEVENT TRANSWAP). Thereafter, the application may be marked non-swappable by another special SYSEVENT (SYSEVENT DONTSWAP). Whenever such an application terminates, whether normally or abnormally, the operating system implicitly issues yet another special SYSEVENT on the application's behalf, if it has not already done so (SYSEVENT OKSWAP).|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in <b>external</b> <b>storage</b> compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E

500|$|After the Battle of Britain, {{smaller scale}} {{production}} of the H-4s began. The H-4 was virtually identical to the He 111P-4 with the DB 600s swapped for the Jumo 211D-1s. Some also used the Jumo 211H-1. This variant also differed from the H-3 in that it could either carry 2,000kg (4,410lb) of bombs internally or mount one or two external racks to carry one 1,800kg (3,970lb) or two 1,000kg (2,210lb) bombs. As these external racks blocked the internal bomb bay doors, a combination of internal and <b>external</b> <b>storage</b> was not possible. A PVR 1006L bomb rack was fitted externally and an 835L (221US gal) tank added to the interior spaces left vacant by {{the removal of the}} internal bomb-bay. The PVR 1006L was capable of carrying a SC 1000 1,000kg (2,210lb) bomb. Some H-4s had their PVC racks modified to drop torpedoes.

500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks.

Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or <b>external</b> <b>storage</b> device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E

2500|$|In general, if {{a set of}} data {{structures}} {{needs to}} be included in linked lists, <b>external</b> <b>storage</b> is the best approach.

2500|$|<b>External</b> <b>storage,</b> on {{the other}} hand, has the {{advantage}} of being more generic, in that the same data structure and machine code can be used for a linked list no matter what the size of the data is.
