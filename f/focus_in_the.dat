Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images were obtained for all patients. We investigated the relationship between <b>the</b> hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer retinal layers of the external limiting membrane (ELM) at the fovea and the photoreceptor integrity and VA. : SD-OCT showed that 58 eyes (53. 7 %) had hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer retinal layers, and 107 eyes (99. 1 %) had hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner retinal layers.

5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights.

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E

The two teams combined for 468 home runs during the season, more than any pair of opponents in World Series history.|$|E
