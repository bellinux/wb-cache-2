25|$|The name {{butadiene}} {{can also}} {{refer to the}} isomer, 1,2-butadiene, which is a cumulated <b>diene</b> with structure H2C=C=CH−CH3. However, this allene is difficult to prepare and has no industrial significance. This <b>diene</b> is also not expected {{to act as a}} <b>diene</b> in a Diels–Alder reaction due to its structure. To effect a Diels–Alder reaction, only a conjugated <b>diene</b> will suffice. The rest of this article concerns only 1,3-butadiene.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 63 {{clinical}} isolates of Proteus mirabilis collected over a 19 -month period were typed by the <b>Dienes</b> test and ribotyping. Ribotyping was performed using the fully automated RiboPrinter Microbial Characterization System (Qualicon, Wilmington, Del.). Isolates that were indistinguishable by the <b>Dienes</b> test and/or ribotyping were characterized further by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE). Most of the isolates represented unique strains as judged by the <b>Dienes</b> test and ribotyping. Forty isolates represented 40 different ribotypes and <b>Dienes</b> types. The remaining 23 isolates were grouped into 13 <b>Dienes</b> types, 12 ribotypes, and 14 PFGE types. The index of discrimination was 0. 980 for the <b>Dienes</b> test, 0. 979 for ribotyping, and 0. 992 for PFGE. Both the <b>Dienes</b> test and ribotyping are useful methods for identifying individual strains of P. mirabilis. The <b>Dienes</b> test is simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform. It can be performed in virtually any laboratory and {{should be used in}} the initial epidemiologic characterization of P. mirabilis isolates...|$|R

For example, the cyclooctadiene ("cod") ligands in bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) are labile.

40|$|The regioselective {{formation}} of highly branched <b>dienes</b> is a challenging task. Design and exploration of alternative working models to achieve such a regioselectivity to accomplish highly branched <b>dienes</b> {{is considered to}} be a historical advancement of Heck reaction to construct branched <b>dienes.</b> On the basis of the utility of carbene transfer reactions, in the reaction of hydrazones with Pd(II) under oxidative conditions, we envisioned obtaining a Pd-bis-carbene complex with alpha-hydrogens, which can lead to branched <b>dienes.</b> Herein, we report a novel Pd-catalyzed selective coupling reaction of hydrazones in the presence of t-BuOLi and benzoquinone to form the corresponding branched <b>dienes.</b> The utility of the Pd catalyst for the cross-coupling reactions for synthesizing branched conjugated <b>dienes</b> is rare.

25|$|Pyrroles with N-substitution can undergo cycloaddition {{reactions}} such as -, -, and -cyclizations.

40|$|When two {{different}} strains of swarming Proteus mirabilis encounter {{one another on}} an agar plate, swarming ceases and a visible line of demarcation forms. This boundary region {{is known as the}} <b>Dienes</b> line and is associated with the formation of rounded cells. While the <b>Dienes</b> line appears to be the product of distinction between self and nonself, many aspects of its formation and function are unclear. In this work, we studied <b>Dienes</b> line formation using clinical isolates labeled with fluorescent proteins. We show that round cells in the <b>Dienes</b> line originate exclusively from one of the swarms involved and that these round cells have decreased viability. In this sense one of the swarms involved is dominant over the other. Close cell proximity is required for <b>Dienes</b> line formation, and when strains initiate swarming in close proximity, the dominant <b>Dienes</b> type has a significant competitive advantage. When one strain is killed by UV irradiation, a <b>Dienes</b> line does not form. Killing of the dominant strain limits the induction of round cells. We suggest that both strains are actively involved in boundary formation and that round cell formation {{is the result of a}} short-range killing mechanism that mediates a competitive advantage, an advantage highly specific to the swarming state. <b>Dienes</b> line formation has implications for the physiology of swarming and social recognition in bacteri...|$|R

25|$|Limonene occurs {{commonly}} as the d or (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes to dipentene at 300°C. When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated <b>diene</b> α-terpinene (which {{can also}} easily {{be converted to}} p-cymene).

Hydrolysis of the cyanochloro group and simultaneous cleavage of the acetate group led to hydroxyketone 3.4. The hydroxyl group was protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (3.5).

25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl substituent. The enantioselectivity {{of the process}} is facilitated from the <b>diene</b> approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent.

The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings(scheme 18).|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{negative}} charge can develop in cycloaddition reactions {{such as the}} Diels-Alder reaction, when the partners are appropriately substituted. As a representative example, Rawal and coworkers developed a chiral catalyst based on α,α,α,α-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol (TADDOL) that could catalyze Diels-Alder reactions. In the following example, the reaction with a highly electron-rich <b>diene</b> and an electron-poor dienophile is thought to develop significant {{negative charge}} on the enal fragment, and is the transition state is stabilized by increased hydrogen bonding to the TADDOL (Ar = 1-naphthyl).|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{aromatic}} character, pyrrole {{is difficult}} to hydrogenate, does not easily react as a <b>diene</b> in Diels–Alder reactions, and does not undergo usual olefin reactions.

Under acidic conditions, pyrroles polymerize easily, and thus many electrophilic reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles. In contrast, substituted pyrroles (including protected pyrroles) have been used in a broad range of transformations.|$|E
