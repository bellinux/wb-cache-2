5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|Dexter <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> a {{crime scene}} at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill.

James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> a {{large house}} {{to prepare the}} corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose {{ownership is}} under {{dispute between the}} Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} distress call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave.

5|$|The Fringe team <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{the scene}} of a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|The earthly authority, whose {{words and}} actions should be cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> minaa (an aluk priest). Aluk {{is not just a}} belief system; it is a {{combination}} of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.|$|E
5|$|The team <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{the home}} of a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E

As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is shocked}} when her estranged father Derek (Clarke Peters) is {{admitted}} to the hospital and diagnosed with cancer. He dies soon thereafter, and when dealing with his effects, Donna learns that he unknowingly fathered another daughter. Though her half-sister is recently deceased, Donna meets her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell), who is being raised by her grandmother, Patti (Barbara Drennan). Within weeks, Patti also dies, and Donna decides to adopt Mia. She and her friend Maria (Phoebe Thomas) compete for a ward sister position on the general surgery ward. Although Maria is the successful applicant, she realises that Donna needs the job in order to support Mia, and withdraws her candidacy so Donna is appointed sister.

The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E
