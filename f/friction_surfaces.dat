40|$|AbstractSurface {{modification}} {{is essential}} for improving the service properties of components. Cladding {{is one of the}} most widely employed methods of <b>surface</b> modification. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> is a candidate process for depositing the corrosion resistant coatings. Being a solid state process, it offers several advantages over conventional fusion based surfacing process. The aim of this work is to identify the relationship between the input variables and the process response and develop the predictive models that can be used in the design of new <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> applications. In the current work, austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 was <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> on high strength low alloy steel substrate. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> parameters, such as mechtrode rotational speed, feed rate of substrate and axial force on mechtrode, play a major role in determining the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength of <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> coatings. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> coating and base metal were tested for pitting corrosion by potentio-dynamic polarization technique. Coating microstructure was characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Coatings in the as deposited condition exhibited strain-induced martensite in austenitic matrix. Pitting resistance of surfaced coatings was found to be much lower than that of mechtrode material and superior to that of substrate. A central composite design with three factors (mechtrode rotational speed, substrate traverse speed, axial load on mechtrode) and five levels was chosen to minimize the number of experimental conditions. Response surface methodology was used to develop the model. In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop a mathematical model to predict the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength by incorporating the <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> is an {{advanced}} process of great potential and an enhanced technology in surface modification. It {{is a solid}} state process, which allows deposition welding at temperatures below the melting range. The present study is on the coating of stain-less steel on Spheroidal Graphite Iron {{through the process of}} <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing.</b> This work explains the perfection obtained through various combination of the parameters used in <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> namely traverse speed, rotational speed and the applied load. Series of test was performed on the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> work piece. Fine bonding has been accomplished between the selected materials out of the process done with variable combination of process parameters. Mechanical tests like bending test, micro-hardness test and corrosion test were conducted. Appreciable hardness values (200 HRC) have been obtained in micro-hardness test. Bend test performed on the surface revealed good strength and reliability of the bonding. The Corrosion test was conducted to find the suitability of these deposits for chemical pumps, pressure vessels and joints of dissimilar metals. The presence of pearlite and ferrite matrix in the microstructure exemplifies the strength of the bond. These results are expected to find great use for important applications in defence, aerospace, electrical, automobile and many other industrial sectors in the engineering fields...|$|R

50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the drum {{can act as a}} {{lubricant}} and reduce braking efficiency. The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point braking efficiency returns. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|E

Options for locating optimum water pipe routes to link two proposed reservoir sites to future demand areas in the Langkawi Island, Malaysia, were developed and simulated.
