40|$|Impedance {{characteristics}} of hydraulic components have a signifcant efect on pressure ripple levels in hydraulic circuits. These pressure ripples lead to vibration of pipework and associatedfittings {{and are a}} source of unreliability and noise. This paper describes an experimental investigation of restrictor and flow control valves using a specially designed circuit. For a restrictor valve, {{it was found that the}} impedance characteristics were influenced by fluid compressibility, fluid inertia, valve vibration and downstream impedance effects. When these effects were taken into account, the valve could be modelled as a simple orijice. The impedance {{characteristics of}} a flow control valve were found to be more complex and wave propagation within the valve <b>fluid</b> <b>passageway</b> had a dominant effect on behaviour.

50|$|The 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission in 1999 to 2001 models had {{serious problems with}} transmission durability. Honda spokesman Mike Spencer stated that four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged <b>fluid</b> <b>passageways</b> in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically. Honda responded to the problems by extending the warranty on the transmission on American 1999-2001 models to 7 years or 100000 mi. A class action settlement further extended coverage to 109000 mi or 93 months for some 1999-2001 Odysseys in the US. Canada is not included. The five-speed automatic was first installed in the Odyssey for the 2002 model, but general reliability of the 1999-2003 transmission was poor according to Consumer Reports. Mike Spencer, a spokesman for Honda, said that the five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of the third-gear clutch pack. As the clutch friction material abraded, it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines and causing erratic shifting. Drivers might suffer slipping, poor or no shifts, or sudden down-shifts from 5th gear to 2nd gear.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to find out how properties of a flocculation agent and flocculation kinetics affect the morphology of fibre flocs and how dewatering of a fibre suspension may be attributed to floc morphology. Fibre flocculation, analysed in terms of floc size, mass fractal dimension, floc strength, and the kinetic constant of flocculation, was measured with a digital image analysis system using cationic polyacrylamides as flocculants and NaCl as a coagulant. The results suggest that the kinetics of fibre flocculation is not a key factor determining floc properties but follows from the high bonding ability of the flocculation agent, which also lies behind the high floc density and size, i. e., the factors that lead to fast flocculation and improved floc properties are partly the same. In addition to interfibre bonding strength, the structure of the bonding layer of polymeric flocculants was found to be a significant factor describing floc morphology. Dewaterability of the fibre suspension was improved by increased floc density, which promotes fast water flow through the large voids around the dense flocs, while large, irregular flocs induced loose floc packing, which further improved dewatering by creating larger voids. Increased floc strength seemed to reduce the sealing of <b>fluid</b> <b>passageways,</b> particularly {{on the surface of the}} wire, where fibre squeezing could blind the filter fabric...|$|R
30|$|Detailed {{geological}} {{information is}} unnecessary {{to detect the}} presence of ore deposits, but such information might provide additional constraints to support the survey. Bathymetry is particularly important. Using an AUV is effective in this sense because it can acquire bathymetric data during the survey. As an example, for this survey, at least two sites are of interest {{from the viewpoint of}} geological information in exploring hydrothermal ore deposits. First, a large scarp structure southwest of the Sunrise deposit with a volcanic ridge (x of approx. 300  m and y of approx. 300  m in Fig.  1 c) is a candidate because <b>fluid</b> <b>passageways</b> are likely to form near the edges of scarps and fault structures. Nevertheless, no self-potential anomaly was detected around the observed scarp structure (Fig.  3 b). Second, an intensely low-magnetization area (x[*]<[*] 0  m and y[*]<[*]−[*] 500  m in Fig.  1 c) discovered by Honsho et al. (2016 a) is an interesting area to be surveyed. Honsho et al. (2016 a) reported that this low-magnetic anomaly might represent a fluid conduit that forms the Sunrise deposit east of this magnetic low. Nevertheless, no intense self-potential anomaly was detected above this low-magnetization area (Figs.  1 c, 3 b). This low-magnetization zone and the Sunrise deposit, both showing low magnetization (Honsho et al. 2016 a), are indistinguishable based solely on magnetic surveys, but can be distinguished by the present self-potential survey.|$|R

The microvalve comprises a SiC housing which includes a first lower portion and a second upper portion. The lower portion of the SiC housing includes a passageway therethrough, a microvalve seat, and a moveable SiC diaphragm. The SiC diaphragm includes a centrally located boss and radially extending corrugations which may be sinusoidally shaped. The boss of the SiC diaphragm moves and modulates {{in a range of}} positions between a closed position wherein the boss interengages said microvalve seat prohibiting communication of <b>fluid</b> through the <b>passageway</b> and a fully open position when the boss is spaced apart from the seat at its maximum permitting communication of <b>fluid</b> through said <b>passageway.</b> The actuator includes a SiC top plate affixed to the boss of the diaphragm and a first electrode and the second upper portion of the SiC housing further includes a second electrode...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic response, {{stability}} and fluid-borne noise characteristics of fluid power components and {{systems can be}} strongly influenced by the inertia or 'hydraulic inductance' of the <b>fluid</b> in <b>passageways,</b> which are often of complex geometry. The hydraulic inductance is a parameter that has often proved {{to be very difficult}} to quantify accurately, either theoretically or experimentally. This paper presents a method of numerical calculation of the hydraulic inductance in a passageway. The method is simple to apply and can be applied to geometries of arbitrary complexity. A simple way of using a Computational Fluid Dynamics package for calculating hydraulic inductance is also demonstrated. Results are presented for a simple cylindrical orifice, a simple spool valve and a conical poppet valve. The effect of the inductance on the response of a poppet valve is demonstrated...|$|R

The new processes advance the state-of-the-art in the finishing of cast-metal parts that carry <b>fluids</b> in interior <b>passageways.</b> Currently, these parts often have manufacturing imperfections which decrease their precision and therefore functional performance. Finishing processes exist which correct these imperfections, but they are time consuming and costly, relegating their use to high-value, low-volume production applications.

40|$|<b>Fluid</b> inertia within <b>passageways</b> of {{hydraulic}} components {{is known}} to {{have a significant impact on}} their dynamic response and fluid-borne noise characteristics. This inertance is often hard to quantify either theoretically or experimentally due to the complex nature of component geometries, and bacause it is related to dynamic, not steady-state behaviour. Previous studies have used the secondary source method to determine the impedance, of which the inertance is an important parameter, of components such as positive displacement pumps and valves. A simple acoustic test for predicting the inertance of a component is proposed. The component must have a direct connection between inlet and outlet, and as such is directly applicable to valves and accumulators. Results were compared to theory for known components, including uniform pipes, and woth predictions made using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package ANSYS CFX, using the anology of steady state flow through porous passageways of identical geometry. In general, good agreement between acoustic measurements and CFD predictions was obtained for a number of ball valves, gate valves and an accumulator poppet valve...|$|R
