5000|$|Ola Raknes loved poetry, and {{together}} with I. C. Grøndahl he published the first Norwegian literature history volume in English in 1923. He was an appreciated literary translator, both of scholarly {{as well as}} artistic prose. He was the philological supervisor of Henrik Rytter's ten-volume translation of Shakespeare. Sigmund Skard writes of the two dictionaries which Ola Raknes wrote (Skard, 1975), that far from being mere glossaries, they were very personal works which again reflected the quest of Ola Raknes for his identity. Skard compares this work with that of Ivar Aasen more than 50 years earlier. Aasen had made {{his way through the}} entire tributary of Norwegian folk speech and compared it with another Nordic language: Danish. Skard writes that Raknes, [...] "with strong power of empathy, integrated the values of two of the largest and oldest European cultural languages, procured everything that they possessed, from past to present, and confronted that with his own linguistic heritage and his personal linguistic sense. To check himself he drew in the living present-day speech in one of the richest East Norwegian rural dialects, in collaboration with his first wife, the poet Aslaug Vaa, as well as her father, the farmer Tor Vaa. Long into the future will these books be the <b>daily</b> <b>benefit</b> to everyone who works with the Norwegian language." ...|$|E
40|$|The average <b>daily</b> <b>benefit</b> to {{cost ratio}} of a {{building}} energy storage system is mainly constrained by the battery lifetime. This paper aims to minimize the average daily cost of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) (comprised of a battery and supercapacitor) by optimizing the battery capacity. A novel optimization model is proposed with the objective to find the minimum average daily investment cost of the HESS. The objective function has two parts: (1) the investment cost formula for the battery is derived {{as a function of}} the battery capacity, which has an interdependence with the minimum state of charge (SOC) and the maximum discharge current; (2) the investment cost formula for the supercapacitor is also established as a function of battery capacity by matching the maximum battery power with that of the supercapacitor. Case studies demonstrate several ways to increase the average <b>daily</b> <b>benefit</b> to cost ratio: (1) adopting a suitable control strategy to avoid capacity saturation; (2) reducing the battery SOC to increase the threshold for the maximum discharge current (MDC) saturation; and (3) increasing MDC to raise the threshold for the SOC saturation. Results show that the average <b>daily</b> <b>benefit</b> to cost ratio is doubled compared to previous work...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the economic benefit for the New York Metroplex area of the controller-to-pilot communication standard known as Data-Communication. RAMS simulation software was first used to evaluate the potential impact of the new technology on airport operations in the three airports of LaGuardia, Newark and John F. Kennedy. The new technology would allow for a greater number of operations and reduce the average hourly workload for air traffic controllers. We employ a two steps procedure. First, we estimate a benefit function per number of hourly operations. Second, using the empirical distribution of hourly operations and the benefit function found in step one, we compute the average <b>daily</b> <b>benefit</b> from the technology as the reduced cost from delays plus the net effect on controllers workload due to its implementation. The procedure is applied at each airport individually and to the metroplex area as a whole. Our estimates show that the introduction of Data-Comm would yield significant savings in the New York Metroplex area. ...|$|E

30|$|We {{estimate}} the direct fiscal net effect for previously subsidized workers by deducting the estimated {{amount of the}} subsidy from estimated savings in unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance as well as estimated additional employee- and employer-based social security contributions and taxes during our observation period of   3.5   years (assuming an interest rate of zero). We do not have individual information {{on the size of}} the subsidy, but information merged through cost accounting at the local level. Mean savings in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are computed from individual <b>daily</b> <b>benefits</b> at the beginning of the unemployment spell preceding the analyzed hiring. Fiscal savings and additional incomes are computed on the base of gains in mean daily wages  (1 c) and mean daily wage differences  (2 c) from Tables  2 and  4. Similar to Pfeiffer and Winterhager (2005), we assume that social security contributions and taxes constitute on average   50 % of earnings. We neglect administrative costs of handling the subsidy and administrative savings from less future contact with the local labor market offices.|$|R

30|$|Applications of HS {{algorithms}} in hydrological {{science can}} be divided by discipline, as with other meta-heuristic algorithms, and the first hydrological applications of the HS technique were described in 2001. HS algorithms were applied to minimize {{the cost of a}} pipe network during the design process and to estimate parameters for the non-linear Muskingum routing model [1, 2]. Subsequently, Paik et al. [24] developed a parameter calibration method for rainfall–runoff models and demonstrated how adopting powerful meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as HS algorithms can enable researchers to focus on aspects of the rainfall–runoff model other than parameter calibration. Ayvaz [25] first introduced HS algorithms to aquifer modeling, using the technique to determine aquifer parameters and the zonal structure of these parameters based on a given set of observations of piezometric head. More recently, Kougias and Theodossiou [26] solved problems related to dam operation using HS techniques; in particular, they investigated the optimum operation of a four-reservoir system over one day, with the aim of maximizing the <b>daily</b> <b>benefits</b> obtained from the reservoir system. The studies cited here represent {{only a small portion of}} the existing literature in this field, yet their results demonstrate the potential for use of HS algorithms in solving complex optimization problems successfully and efficiently.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{emergence}} of the pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus in 2009 saw {{a significant increase in}} the therapeutic and prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) to mitigate the impact of this highly transmissible virus. Prior to the pandemic, many countries stockpiled NAIs and developed pandemic plans for the use of antiviral drugs, based on either treatment of high-risk individuals and/or prophylaxis of contacts. However, to date there has been a lack of in vivo models to test the efficacy of treatment or prophylaxis with NAIs, for influenza-infected individuals or exposed contacts, in a household setting. METHODS: A ferret model of household contact was developed to study the efficacy of different prophylaxis regimens in preventing infection in contact ferrets exposed to influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 -infected index ferrets. RESULTS: Among the different prophylactic regimens, contact ferrets receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis twice daily showed better outcomes than those receiving oseltamivir once <b>daily.</b> <b>Benefits</b> included a significant delay in the time to secondary infection, lower weight loss and higher activity levels. The treatment of index ferrets at 36 h post-infection did not influence either secondary infection rates or clinical symptoms in exposed contact ferrets. Neither prophylaxis nor treatment prevented infection or reduced the duration of viral shedding, although clinical symptoms did improve in infected animals receiving prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Different oseltamivir prophylaxis regimens did not prevent infections, but consistently resulted in a reduction in symptoms in infected ferrets. However, oseltamivir prophylaxis failed to reduce viral titres, which warrants further investigation in humans. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

With an expanding workforce and growing number of HiSeqs, {{it has become more}} imperative to improve workflow to achieve more ambitious quarterly goals set by upper management. To improve workflow, a lean methodology needs to be adopted and sustained by all Sequencing personnel. 5 S is a basic and beneficial lean manufacturing technique that guides organizations to simplify, clean and maintain a visible and productive workspace. 5 S has many <b>daily</b> <b>benefits,</b> such as decreased equipment setup times and fewer mistakes, that add up to annual improvements in productivity and quality. 5 S methodology was implemented in the GS laboratory using five steps as implied by its name. The five steps are as follows: sort, set in order, shine, standardize and sustain. The initial results of 5 S implementation are promising. There is a clear reduction in HiSeq loading times (three minute reduction) and user error (33 % reduction) after 5 S implementation. Increased efficiency and productivity will not only allow Genomic Services to perform higher quality sequence runs with decreased cost, but will improve Illumina???s reputation within the scientific community. Once Genomic Services is able to execute the Equipment Engineering Plan of Action and fully sustain these 5 S improvements, the 5 S score will increase and the laboratory will be in a true 5 S environment for continuous improvement.

40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} socio-demographic {{and clinical}} {{risk factors of}} medication nonadherence does not always help in addressing adherence in individual patients. Classifying patients according to subjective adherence influencing factors may aid practitioners in choosing adequate strategies for improving medication adherence. A total of 171 outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were classified according to factors influencing their medication adherence assessed using the Rating of Medication Influences Scale. Additionally, psychotic symptoms, depression, and insight, also known to influence pharmacological treatment motivation, were assessed. A cluster analysis yielded 3 groups that were distinguished both by the relative ranking of adherence influences and by specific associations with risk factors of nonadherence. For the "Interpersonal, Future-oriented Group" (n= 59, 35 % of the sample), interpersonal factors (positive therapeutic relationship, positive attitudes of significant others towards medication), immediate positive consequences of the medication intake (<b>daily</b> <b>benefits,</b> no perceived pressure to take medication), and avoiding future negative consequences of non-compliance, such as relapse and re-hospitalization, were essential for adherence. The "Autonomous, Future-oriented Group" (n= 69, 40 % of the sample) appraised interpersonal factors as being less important {{as compared to the}} other groups. This group exhibited significantly fewer depressive symptoms than the first group and had significantly more stable partnerships as compared to the other groups. The "Autonomous, Present-oriented Group" (n= 43, 25 % of the sample) was mainly motivated by immediate positive consequences and displayed higher levels of cognitive disorganization and negative symptoms than the second group, as well as the lowest level of insight of all groups. Treatment strategies addressing adherence enhancement in schizophrenia may profit by considering both the patient's subjective adherence attitude profile as well as the specific pattern of risk factors for nonadherence including depression, lack of insight, negative syndrome, cognitive disorganization and socio-demographic factors, which are differentially associated with each adherence attitude profile...|$|R

Music also offers adolescents relatable messages that allow them to take comfort in knowing that others feel the same way they do. It can also serve as a creative outlet to release or control emotions and find ways of coping with difficult situations. Music can improve an adolescent's mood by reducing stress and lowering anxiety levels, which can help counteract or prevent depression. Music education programs provide adolescents with a safe place to express themselves and learn life skills such as self-discipline, diligence, and patience. These programs also promote confidence and self-esteem. Ethnomusicologist Alan Merriam (1964) once stated that music is a universal behavior - it is something with which everyone can identify.
