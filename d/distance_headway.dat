Two groups of twenty participants carried out headway instructions in a driving simulator (one time headway group and one <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> group). Target headway size (1, 1. 5 and 2 s) and vehicle speed (50, 80 and 100 km/h) were varied within participants. Absolute estimation errors (absolute difference between instructed and chosen headway) indicated a reduced accuracy for higher speeds and for larger target headways, for both time and <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> instructions. Relative estimation errors (relative difference between instructed and chosen headways, representing a difference between under and over estimations) indicated a difference between time and <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> instructions. Participants showed larger headways than instructed with higher speeds in case of the <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> instructions. These results suggest that (a) time headway choice is not independent of vehicle speed thereby contradicting the predictions made by psychophysics theory; (b) relative and absolute estimation errors as the dependent variable produce dissimilar results; (c) in case of <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> instructions, drivers choose smaller than instructed headways at higher vehicle speed...|$|E

It is a significant microscopic traffic flow characteristics parameter used in various traffic engineering applications such as level of service, highway capacity analysis, traffic safety and microscopic traffic simulation. Its values are also essential in evaluation of congestion level and overtaking manoeuvre related problems. <b>Distance</b> <b>headway,</b> being spatial parameter is difficult to measure directly in the field.

This system could enable drivers to choose their headway differently by providing in-vehicle advice. How well are drivers able to follow a time or a <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> advice and what effect has vehicle speed and advised headway on their ability? To test this, a group of 20 participants completed nine headway adjustment tasks in a driving simulator experiment.

The absolute difference between the advised and the chosen headway acted as a performance measure. In the experiment no performance difference could be found between the driver’s carrying out target headway and those carrying out <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> advice. Furthermore increasing vehicle speed significantly reduced the driver’s ability to carry out headway advice. This effect was not found for target headway. High inter-driver difference in headway estimation led to high standard deviations in estimation error.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> between {{vehicles}} in a platoon {{is difficult to}} measure unless the vehicles are equipped with costly equipment such as laser or radar sensors, or an image processing system. This paper proposes an alternate approach to estimating <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> indirectly from measurable variables such as the acceleration rate and velocity of selected {{vehicles in}} the platoon. Assuming a six-vehicle platoon, a particle filter (PF) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are applied in order to estimate the headway of each vehicle based on the measurement variables of three (or all) vehicles in the platoon. The state-space models of the PF and the UKF are given by the conservation equation of headway and the conventional car-following model. To evaluate the PF and UKF performance, two scenarios were prepared: one assumed that prior knowledge of a model parameter differed from what was actually observed as posterior information, {{the other was a}} situation where a platoon vehicle slowed down unexpectedly during the car-following process. In both situations, the state-space model itself was unable to describe the dynamics of <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> precisely, and the PF and the UKF were applied to minimize the <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> errors caused by the incorrect model parameter and the unexpected vehicle slowdown. Numerical analysis demonstrated that both the PF and UKF were successful in estimating the <b>headway</b> <b>distance,</b> even when the car-following model did not express the true car-following phenomena. We also determined that, if all vehicles are equipped as probe cars, and thus capable of measuring the acceleration rate and velocity, the PF is superior to UKF when estimating the <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> precisely. However, UKF is more stable than the PF when measurements are not taken from all vehicles, especially when a vehicle in the platoon unexpectedly slows downs during the car-following process...|$|R

40|$|The major {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to propose a low-cost accurate distance estimation approach. It can potentially be used in driver modelling, accident avoidance and autonomous driving. Based on MATLAB and Python, sensory data from a Continental radar and a monocular dashcam were fused using a Kalman filter. Both sensors were mounted on a Volkswagen Sharan, performing repeated driving on a same route. The established system consists of three components, radar data processing, camera data processing and data fusion using Kalman filter. For radar data processing, raw radar measurements were directly collected from a data logger and analyzed using a Python program. Valid data were extracted and time stamped for further use. Meanwhile, a Nextbase monocular dashcam was used to record corresponding traffic scenarios. In order to measure <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> from these videos, object depicting the leading vehicle was first located in each frame. Afterwards, the corresponding vanishing point was also detected and used to automatically compute the camera posture, which is to minimize the interference caused by camera vibration. The <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> can hence be obtained by assuming the leading and host vehicles were in the same ground plane. After both sensory data were obtained, they were synthesized and fused using Kalman filter, to generate a better estimation of <b>headway</b> <b>distance.</b> The performances of both sensors were assessed individually and the correlation between their measurements was evaluated by replotting radar measurements on the video stream. The results of individual sensors and Kalman filter were compared to investigate the optimization performance of the data fusion approach. This is a general guidance of <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> estimation with a low cost radar and a monocular camera. With described general procedures, this paper can allow researchers to easily fuse radar and camera measurements to obtain optimized <b>headway</b> <b>distance</b> estimation.

However, the behavior of the driver population on the <b>distance</b> <b>headway</b> was not considered. Wiedemann {{proposed a}} psychophysical model to characterize individual driver behavior based on conscious and unconscious reaction and perception [9]. Drivers unconsciously harmonize small changes in speed for small distance headways, so the reaction of these drivers is slow.

The limitations of the Wiedemann model are the constant ranges for perception and reaction which actually vary depending on the speed harmonization [10].|$|E

However, those resources coexist with roadway design and traffic control practices in the local country, and cannot be simply transferred to China for applications. For example, the Highway Capacity Manual in the United State describes roadway capacity under ideal conditions and estimates practical capacities under prevailing conditions in the field. This capacity and the conditions for change are expected to be different on Chinese roadways as the local roadway design (lane width, curves and grades), vehicle size, and traffic mix are different. This research looks into an approach to the capacity issue different from the Highway Capacity Manual. According to the car-following principle, this paper first describes the safety criteria that affect traffic operations. Several speed schemes are subsequently discussed as they are affected by the maximum speed achievable under the local conditions. The study has shown that the effect of geometric and traffic conditions can be effectually reflected in the maximum speed adopted by the drivers.
