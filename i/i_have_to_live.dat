500|$|In September 2006, Barkley {{once again}} reiterated {{his desire to}} run for governor. He noted, [...] "I can't run until 2014... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak." [...] In July 2007, he made a video declaring his support for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election. In September 2007, during a {{broadcast}} on Monday Night Football, Barkley announced that he {{bought a house in}} Alabama to satisfy residency requirements for a 2014 campaign for governor. In addition, Barkley declared himself an Independent and not a Democrat as previously reported. [...] "The Republicans are full of it", Barkley said, [...] "The Democrats are a little less full of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp's {{nickname}} is the [...] "Non-Flying Dutchman" [...] due to {{his fear}} of flying. This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight, prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag. Following this incident, Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help:I've got this problem and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with it. I can't do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can't explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can't fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can't sleep.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with that".|$|E
5000|$|On WGBH-TV, Wambere said of Ugandan media, “I never outed myself. The media outed me… but at {{one time}} I found that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> the reality... We are Ugandans and we are Africans. And we were born homosexuals.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} thy usefulness, and that thou art very strong; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with thee. Had I known, in parts beyond sea, any one more useful than thou, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> sought <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first Jackson Pollock show Frankenthaler saw {{was at the}} Betty Parsons Gallery in 1950. She <b>had</b> this <b>to</b> {{say about}} seeing Pollock's {{paintings}} Autumn Rhythm, Number 30, 1950 (1950), Number One,1950 (Lavender Mist) (1950):"It was all there. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in this land. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there, and master the language." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, Blair's {{childhood}} sweetheart died in {{an accident}} {{at the age of}} 18; later, talking about her tragic loss, she commented: [...] "It made me realize <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live...</b> Having the boy I loved not anymore on this planet, I'd better live, I'd better do something".|$|E
2500|$|On {{character}} interactions, Greenberg noted {{how there}} was [...] "a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We {{used a lot}} of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We can't {{make you}} take us seriously, Mrs. Ambrose," [...] he protested. [...] "May I ask how you've spent your time? Reading--philosophy?" [...] (He saw the black book.) [...] "Metaphysics and fishing!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> again <b>I</b> believe I should devote myself {{to one or}} the other." [...] He began turning the pages.|$|R
6000|$|... "An' {{like the}} river islands," [...] Billy interpolated. [...] "Richer in hell, but looks {{too much like}} hard work. It'll do for those that's stuck on hard work--God knows, they's nothin' here to induce a fellow to knock off ever {{for a bit of}} play. No fishin', no huntin', nothin' but work. I'd work myself, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> here." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{there was}} a good deal of scandal about my killing a sprospective father-in-law, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> it down by not marrying Maud--who has lived single, as a rule, ever since. All this epigastric tercentenary might have been avoided if she had only allowed a good deal of margin for my {{probable}} condition when she splanned her little practicable joke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{said the}} Jew, turning rather pale. 'They--they're mine, Oliver; my little property. All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> upon, {{in my old}} age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I reckon not--leastwise, {{not while}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> such a dog's life as {{this on the}} Spitfire. Say, are them your clothes?" [...] he went on, {{pointing}} to the articles of wearing apparel Lowell had given me.|$|E
30|$|When I came to Germany for {{the first}} time, I was just 20 [*]years old. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> many good dreams of living with my husband and going for outings. But when I came here the life was totally different. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> alone the whole day in my apartment. I waited for my husband the whole day. I felt totally insulted. I used to feel myself to be a bird in a cage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, George, I drank beer {{in those}} days; {{it is one}} of things of which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>to</b> see the folly. In fact, there are not many things of which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not <b>lived</b> <b>to</b> see the folly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Caine {{said that}} it was one of the worst films he had been {{involved}} in, along with The Swarm and Ashanti, because no one knew what it was all about. Woody Allen was quoted in 2005 saying, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> my life again, I'd do everything the same, except that I wouldn't see The Magus." [...] Despite the critical failure, the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography.|$|R

He'll treat them like bitches if they don't realize that they're queens. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get Bobby out of me, or else I'd be emotionally unbalanced.

2500|$|For many years, Beban was typecast as a French {{character}} actor. Beban later recalled, [...] "No {{one will}} ever know what an awful time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get away from French character. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> and for French character parts I could name my own salary, but for anything else I wasn’t {{worth as much as}} a chorus man." [...] No longer wishing to play parts that cast him as [...] "a Sunday comic supplement," [...] Beban begged to be given serious parts where he could portray a more rounded human being.|$|R
60|$|And he thought: I, {{who believe}} in bravery and kindness; I, who hate cruelty--if I do this cruel thing, what shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> for; how shall I work; how bear myself?

6000|$|... "It {{may seem}} absurd to you," [...] Arnold protested, [...] "but it's my duty for the present, anyhow, and I {{am going to}} do it.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{ten years}} in New York. It was then a simple town, with few street lights north of Forty-second street. Now the place is pretty terrible to me, perhaps the ugliest city in the world. I decided {{that the only way}} to get out of New York was to write a {{successful}} novel. So I tried with The Spenders and when I got a substantial advance from publishers, I quit my job and beat it for the high hills of Colorado.—Harry Leon Wilson ...|$|R
40|$|God <b>had</b> ordained that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in {{and serve}} many {{countries}} in every continent; but more especially Europe and South East Asia. My life experiences {{of more than a}} half-century have taught me the absolute need for the European, with his higher culture and way of life, <b>to</b> <b>live</b> incomplete separation or “apartheid” from the natives of Asiatic and African countries; not because they are black or brown or yellow, but because the environment in which they have grown up has produced types of a lower standard of morality and culture...|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be {{a number of things that}} Mrs. Kennedy did not like. I thought my chance of {{pleasing}} that critical lady extremely small, especially when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up <b>to</b> Clark Oliver's personality. However, I dressed as expeditiously as possible. The novelty of the adventure rather pleased me. I always liked doing unusual things. Anything was better than lounging away the evening at my hotel. It couldn't do any harm. I owed Clark Oliver a good turn and I would save Mrs. Kennedy the annoyance of a vacant chair.|$|R
