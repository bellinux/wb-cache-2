40|$|We {{present a}} model for pore {{stabilization}} in membranes without surface tension. Whereas an <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> is always unstable (since it either shrinks tending to re-seal or grows without bound til to membrane disintegration), it is shown that excluded volume interactions {{in a system of}} many pores can stabilize individual pores of a given size in a certain range of model parameters. For such a multipore membrane system, the distribution of pore size and associated pore lifetime are calculated within the mean field approximation. We predict that, above certain temperature when the effective line tension becomes negative, the membrane exhibits a dynamic sieve-like porous structure. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

A new experimental method for growing the <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> from a seed bubble is introduced.

30|$|Unlike for {{the cases}} with water {{circulation}} (Figs.  2 and 7), the initial relatively {{small amount of}} water is never exchanged, which limits the influence of its initial composition on large amounts of basalt. We found for the <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> that, independent from temperature, the volume of secondary minerals is nearly equal to the total volume available in the system. This finding is {{in agreement with the}} field observation that the pore spaces of the vesicles are partially or totally filled with secondary minerals (Weisenberger and Selbekk 2009). The calculated mineralogy for <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> does not substantially differ from the calculated mineralogy of the connected pore space. The most significant difference concerns the occurrence of the following sequence of zeolites in the model described in the literature (e.g., Gudmundsson and Arnorsson 2005): low-temperature zeolites up to 100  °C, laumontite from 100 to 200  °C, and wairakite above 200  °C. The calculations for the connected pore space did not predict the precipitation of laumontite and wairakite. Therefore, it might be possible that the presence of those two phases is related to the occurrence of <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> or vesicles.|$|R

The experimental results also show that processing pressure {{can be used as a}} control parameter to either increase or terminate porosity formation. A theoretical model is introduced which indicates that the pore formation process is limited by the diffusion of solute-gas through the melt, and that the observed response toa pressure increase is attributed to the re-equilibration of solute concentration in the melt associated with the increased melt pressure...|$|E

The line-distributed tension can be transformed equivalently into an area-distributed tension stress that is defined as tension suction and will pose the similar effect on shear strength and deformation as that of matric suction. According to the actual contact states of meniscus with the surface of soil particles, the unsaturated soil with Continuous pore Water and Continuous pore Air (CWCA) unsaturated soils can be further classified into the overlapping and non-overlapping CWCA unsaturated soil.

40|$|Shrinkage strains {{measured}} from microstructural simulations using the mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model for solid state sintering are discussed. This model represents the microstructure using digitized discrete {{sites that are}} either grain or pore sites. The algorithm used to simulate densification by vacancy annihilation removes an <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> site at a grain boundary and collapses a column of sites extending from the vacancy {{to the surface of}} sintering compact, through the center of mass of the nearest grain. Using this algorithm, the existing published kMC models are shown to produce anisotropic strains for homogeneous powder compacts with aspect ratios different from unity. It is shown that the line direction biases shrinkage strains in proportion the compact dimension aspect ratios. A new algorithm that corrects this bias in strains is proposed; the direction for collapsing the column is determined by choosing a random sample face and subsequently a random point on that face as the end point for an annihilation path with equal probabilities. This algorithm is mathematically and experimentally shown to result in isotropic strains for all samples regardless of their dimensions.

40|$|Predicting S-wave {{velocity}} {{is important}} for reservoir characterization and fluid identification in unconventional resources. A rock physics model-based method is developed for estimating pore aspect ratio and predicting shear wave velocity Vs from the information of P-wave velocity, porosity and mineralogy in a borehole. Statistical distribution of pore geometry is considered in the rock physics models. In the application to the Barnett formation, we compare the high frequency self-consistent approximation (SCA) method that corresponds to <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> spaces, and the low frequency SCA-Gassmann method that describes well-connected pore spaces. Inversion results indicate that compared to the surroundings, the Barnett Shale shows less fluctuation in the pore aspect ratio in spite of complex constituents in the shale. The high frequency method provides a more robust and accurate prediction of Vs for all the three intervals in the Barnett formation, while the low frequency method collapses for the Barnett Shale interval. Possible causes for this discrepancy {{can be explained by}} the fact that poor in situ pore connectivity and low permeability make well-log sonic frequencies act as high frequencies and thus invalidate the low frequency assumption of the Gassmann theory. In comparison, for the overlying Marble Falls and underlying Ellenburger carbonates, both the high and low frequency methods predict Vs with reasonable accuracy, which may reveal that sonic frequencies are within the transition frequencies zone due to higher pore connectivity in the surroundings...|$|E
40|$|The current, commercially available, {{press and}} sinter Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys {{are based on}} wrought or cast alloy {{compositions}} and have not been tailored for the press and sinter process. The limited development of the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys for the press and sinter process can be partly attributed to a poor understanding {{of the effects of}} processing conditions on the sintering behaviour. The primary objective of this work was to investigate and understand the effects of processing conditions on the sintering behaviour of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys. Dilatometry was used in conjunction with other experimental techniques to elucidate and understand the expansion and shrinkage events that occur during the liquid-phase sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) powder metallurgy alloys. Samples were uni-axially pressed from elemental metal powder blends, de-waxed, and then sintered in a horizontal push-rod dilatometer to record the dimensional changes in the pressing direction. The processing conditions examined included the alloy composition, temperature, green density and atmosphere. A liquid forms during heating due to reactions between the alloying elements and the aluminium. This liquid is initially non-wetting on the oxide layer of the aluminium particles, resulting in separation of the particles, which is manifested by expansion of the sample. The oxide is reduced as sintering progresses, alleviating the non-wetting conditions. When more liquid forms, further expansion occurs, despite the improved wetting conditions. It is proposed that atmospheric oxygen and/or nitrogen can react with the liquid, forming a solid phase (‘shell’) at the liquid-vapour interfaces. These shells prevent the liquid from wetting the particles, resulting in further expansion and preventing shrinkage. Unbalanced diffusivities (the Kirkendall effect) between the aluminium and silicon contribute to the expansion. A mechanism is proposed to account for the transition to shrinkage, whereby the shells at the liquid-vapour interface rupture when there is a rapid increase in the volume of contained liquid. The liquid then flows out and over the shells, onto the aluminium substrate, causing shrinkage. Magnesium and nitrogen delay the transition to shrinkage by facilitating nitride shell formation at the solid-liquid interface. Silicon and tin cause an earlier transition to shrinkage by increasing the liquid volume. In addition, tin promotes shrinkage by segregating to the liquid-vapour interfaces, limiting the thickness of the shells at the liquid-vapour interfaces. The two dominant liquid-phase shrinkage mechanisms during the sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys are rearrangement and pore-filling. Contact-flattening is not a dominant shrinkage mechanism, but may occur concurrently with the other mechanisms. If contact flattening occurs, a decrease in the pressure of <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> increases the total shrinkage rate. Nitrogen increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by restricting grain-growth. Magnesium increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by reducing the solid-liquid interface energy. Magnesium and nitrogen are essential for the formation of nitride within <b>isolated</b> <b>pores,</b> which decreases the pore pressure and increases the contribution of contact-flattening on the total shrinkage rate. Silicon reduces the beneficial influence of magnesium during rearrangement by diluting the magnesium content in the liquid. Silicon increases the pore-filling rate due to an increase in the liquid volume. Magnesium increases the pore-filling rate by facilitating aluminium nitride formation within <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> and by increasing the pore-filling. Tin additions can decrease the pore-filling rate due to its segregation to the liquid-vapour interface, limiting the consumption of nitrogen within <b>isolated</b> <b>pores...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of shale reservoirs for gas extraction is largely {{determined by the}} permeability of the rock. Typical pore diameters in shales range from the μm down to the nm scale. The permeability of shale reservoirs {{is a function of}} the interconnectivity between the pore space and the natural fracture network present. We have measured the permeability of the Whitby Mudstone, the exposed counterpart of the Posidonia Shales buried in the Dutch subsurface and a possible target for unconventional gas, using different methods and established a correlation with the microstructures and pore networks present down to the nanometer scale. Whitby Mudstone is a clay rich rock with a low porosity. The permeability of the Whitby Mudstone is in the range of 10 − 18 m 2 – 10 − 21 m 2. 2 D microstructures of the Whitby Mudstone show no connected pore networks, but <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> bodies mainly situated in the clay matrix, whereas 3 D data shows that connected pore networks are present in less compacted parts of the rock. A closely spaced interconnected fracture network is often required to speed up transport of fluids from the matrix into a producing well.

40|$|Context: Solar {{pores are}} small sunspots lacking a {{penumbra}} {{that have a}} prevailing vertical magnetic field component. They can include light bridges at places with locally reduced magnetic field. Like sunspots, they exhibit {{a wide range of}} oscillatory phenomena. Aims: A large <b>isolated</b> <b>pore</b> with a light bridge (NOAA 11005) is studied to obtain characteristics of a chromospheric filamentary structure around the pore, to analyse oscillations and waves in and around the pore, and to understand the structure and brightness of the light bridge. Methods: Spectral imaging observations in the line Ca II 854. 2 nm and complementary spectropolarimetry in Fe I lines, obtained with the DST/IBIS spectrometer and HINODE/SOT spectropolarimeter, were used to measure photospheric and chromospheric velocity fields, oscillations, waves, the magnetic field in the photosphere, and acoustic energy flux and radiative losses in the chromosphere. Results: The chromospheric filamentary structure around the pore has all important characteristics of a superpenumbra: it shows an inverse Evershed effect and running waves, and has a similar morphology and oscillation character. The granular structure of the light bridge in the upper photosphere can be explained by radiative heating. Acoustic waves leaking up from the photosphere along the inclined magnetic field in the light bridge transfer enough energy flux to balance the total radiative losses of the light-bridge chromosphere. Conclusions: The presence of a penumbra is not a necessary condition for the formation of a superpenumbra. The light bridge is heated by radiation in the photosphere and by acoustic waves in the chromosphere.

From the point of view of ecology and environmental protection it is particularly actual to investigate processes of porous materials interaction with water in liquid and gaseous phases. Since one mole of water contains 6, 022140857 · 10 ^ 23 molecules of H_ 2 O, macroscopic approaches considering the water vapor as continuum media in the framework of classical aerodynamics are mainly used to describe properties, for example properties of water vapor in the pore. In this paper we construct and use for simulation the macroscopic two-dimensional diffusion model describing the behavior of water vapor inside the <b>isolated</b> <b>pore.</b> Together with the macroscopic model it is proposed microscopic model of the behavior of water vapor inside the isolated pores. This microscopic model is built within the molecular dynamics approach. In the microscopic model a description of each water molecule motion is based on Newton classical mechanics considering interactions with other molecules and pore walls. Time evolution of water vapor - pore system is explored. Depending on the external to the pore conditions the system evolves to various states of equilibrium, characterized by different values of the macroscopic characteristics such as temperature, density, pressure.

40|$|Models for {{prediction}} of the elastic characteristics {{of natural and}} synthetic porous materials are re-examined and new models are introduced. First, the Vavakin–Salganik (VS) model for materials with <b>isolated</b> spherical <b>pores</b> is extended {{in order to take}} into account various statistical distributions of pore sizes. It is shown that the predictions of the extended VS model are in good agreement with experimental data for porous materials with <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> such as foamed titanium, porous glass and sandstone. However, the model is in a considerable disagreement with the experimental data for materials sintered from metal powders. The disagreement is explained by the presence of merged and open pores whose shapes cannot be well approximated as spheres. Using the theory of geometrical probabilities, the amount of pores that are close enough to overlap is estimated, and a model is introduced where merging pores are modelled as corresponding ellipsoids. Another modification is proposed to take into account open pores. This modification is based on the classical Rabotnov–Kachanov approach to damage accumulation in the loaded material. Finally, predictions given by the above models, and their combination is compared with experiments. A good agreement is observed between the combined model and the available experimental data for a variety of sintered materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of porous structure and mechanical properties of binary glasses under tensile loading were examined using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider vitreous systems {{obtained in the}} process of phase separation after a rapid isochoric quench of a glass-forming liquid to a temperature below the glass transition. The porous structure in undeformed samples varies from a connected porous network to a random distribution of <b>isolated</b> <b>pores</b> upon increasing average glass density. We find that at small strain, the elastic modulus follows a power-law dependence on the average glass density and the pore size distribution remains nearly the same as in quiescent samples. Upon further loading, the pores become significantly deformed and coalesce into larger voids that leads to formation of system-spanning empty regions associated with breaking of the material.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale route to produce defect-free monolithic ceramic specimens with tailored pore/grain microstructure has been developed. The target configuration consisted of <b>isolated</b> individual <b>pores</b> 0. 5 - 1 µm size, {{immersed in a}} matrix of 200 - 300 nm sized grains with total porosity levels of 10 to 20...|$|R
