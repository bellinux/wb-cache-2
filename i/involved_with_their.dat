One of the producers replied by calling Campbell an [...] "asshole", commenting that the crew had gone severely over budget.

By 1733 the changing fortunes of the gang may have prompted him to leave the butchery trade, and he became the landlord of a public house, most likely the Rose and Crown at Clay Hill.

500|$|While LucasArts {{proceeded}} to produce Escape from Monkey Island in , they canceled development of sequels to Sam & Max Hit the Road and Full Throttle stating that [...] "After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations, we've {{decided that this}} was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC." [...] Subsequently, the studio dismissed many of the people <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> adventure games, some of whom went on to set up Telltale Games, creating an episodic series of Sam & Max games. These events, along with other changes in the video game market towards action-based games, are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. Grim Fandangos underperformance was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially [...] "dead" [...] to rival Sierra, as well. LucasArts stated in [...] that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the [...] "next decade". Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after The Walt Disney Company acquisition of Lucasfilm, and was dissolved shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|From {{their teens}} to early twenties, Mosley {{and his brother}} were <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> father's post-war party, the Union Movement (UM), which {{advocated}} a united Europe as its core issue. Trevor Grundy, a central figure in the UM's Youth Movement, writes of the 16-year-old Mosley painting the flash and circle symbol on walls in London {{on the night of}} the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary (4 November 1956). The flash and circle was used by both the UM and the pre-war BUF. He also says Mosley organised a couple of large parties as a way [...] "to get in with lively, ordinary, normal young people, girls as well as boys, and attract them to the Movement by showing that we were like them and didn't go on about Hitler and Mussolini, Franco and British Fascism all the time." [...] Mosley met his future wife Jean at such a party. Mosley and Alexander were photographed posing as Teddy Boys in Notting Hill during the 1958 race riots between Afro-Caribbeans and local white gangs of Teddy Boys.
