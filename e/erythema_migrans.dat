25|$|If {{an unusual}} black scab (eschar) {{develops}} {{at the site}} of a tick bite, or if there are any other signs of illness occurring within a few weeks of a tick bite (especially 'flu-like' symptoms, fever, generalised skin rash, muscular or joint pain), it is recommended that a doctor be consulted and informed about the tick bite – a Rickettsial infection (Rickettsia australis, or Rickettsia honei) may be the cause. Whilst many such Rickettsial infections are self-limiting, early treatment with antibiotics can prevent longer-term problems in some individuals. Doctors in Australia may also wish to investigate the possibility of a Lyme-like disease, particularly if there is also a 'bullseye' or 'target' shaped skin rash (known as <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans).</b>|$|E
25|$|Geographic tongue {{could be}} {{considered}} to be a type of glossitis. It usually presents only on the dorsal 2/3 and lateral surfaces of the tongue, but less commonly an identical condition can occur on other mucosal sites in the mouth, such as the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, mucosa of the cheeks or lips, soft palate or floor of mouth; usually in addition to tongue involvement. In such cases, terms such as stomatitis <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> ectopic geographic tongue, areata migrans, geographic stomatitis, or migratory stomatitis are used instead of geographic tongue. Beside the differences in locations of presentation inside the oral cavity and prevalence among the general population, in all other aspects of clinical significance, symptoms, treatment, and histopathologic appearance, these two forms are identical.|$|E
25|$|Skin lesions of Lyme-like disease. Early {{symptoms}} {{in the first}} four weeks after a tickbite include a rash or red patch that gradually expands over several days. It may get quite large (up to 50mm or more in diameter). This rash is called <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> or EM. It can be difficult to distinguish from an allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} bite. Allergic rashes usually occur within 48 hours of the bite, then fade. EM usually first appears after a delay of 48 hours following the tickbite and gets bigger over a few days or weeks. As it expands, EM rash often has a 'target' or 'bullseye' appearance, clearing in the middle with a more obvious red edge. EM can persist for months or years, coming and going in that time. Sometimes many small EM rashes occur. EM may only occur in as few as 20% of persons with Lyme disease.|$|E

25|$|Lyme disease, {{also known}} as Lyme borreliosis, is an {{infectious}} disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia type which is spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans,</b> that begins {{at the site of}} a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months.|$|E
2500|$|The risk of {{infectious}} transmission increases with {{the duration of}} tick attachment. [...] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may {{reduce the risk of}} Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of <b>erythema</b> <b>migrans</b> (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70-80% of people infected).|$|E

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, {{hampered by the}} absence of detectable antibodies in most patients with <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> is important to prevent late-stage neurologic, rheumatologic, and skin disorders. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi has been claimed to be the causative agent in localized scleroderma (morphea). We used PCR amplification to search for B. burgdorferi outer surface protein OspA–specific sequences in DNA obtained from lesional skin biopsies on Finnish patients with clinically suspect <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans,</b> lymphocytoma, morphea, or with diverse skin manifestations and persistent high antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagellar antigen. Seronegative patients with other skin lesions served as controls. The amplicons obtained with primers specific for B. burgdorferi type strain B 31 ospA sequence did not hybridize to the corresponding probes, and thus the DNA amplified from a Finnish B. burgdorferi <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> skin isolate was sequenced. This 98 -nucleotide sequence of ospA (332 – 429) showed 11 % to 14 % nucleotide divergence compared with the North American type strain (B 31), several European strains, and an East Siberian tick strain. The sequence was almost identical (99 %) to a Swedish isolate from acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Using oligonucleotides specific for the Finnish strain, a positive polymerase chain reaction – based hybridization was obtained in six of seven untreated <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> patients infected in Finland or in Estonia, and in the lymphocytoma patient. Only two of the <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> patients had IgG or IgM antibodies to flagellin. However, all seven morphea lesions {{as well as the other}} lesions were polymerase chain reaction negative. Polymerase chain reaction – based hybridization ofB. burgdoferi OspA gene from skin-derived DNA thus provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool. In conditions not unequivocally known to be caused by B. burgdorferi in morphea, this assay was negative. We also demonstrate that peri-Baltic B. burgdorferi isolates show homology in their OspA genes but differ from geographically more distant isolates...|$|R
50|$|Clinical {{presentation}} of Lyme disease may include the characteristic bull's-eye rash and <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> (a rash which spreads peripherally and spares the central part), {{as well as}} myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, arrythmia, arthritis, arthralgia, meningitis, neuropathies, and facial nerve palsy.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the polymerase chain reaction could contribute to a better diagnosis of Lyme disease, skin biopsy samples from patients suffering from <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were tested {{for the presence of}} Borrelia burgdorferi by a polymerase chain reaction assay, which was specific for European strains. The spirochete could not be detected microscopically in any of the 15 biopsy samples obtained from nine patients. However, B. burgdorferi could be isolated from seven of eight of these samples, which indicated the presence of spirochetes. Using a nested polymerase chain reaction, we were able to detect B. burgdorferi-specific sequences in 12 of the 15 biopsy samples. Biopsy samples from three of four patients with <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> and four of five patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were found to be positive for B. burgdorferi. The spirochete could be isolated from the biopsy sample, from a patient with <b>erythema</b> chronicum <b>migrans</b> who tested negative, which suggests a false-negative polymerase chain reaction result probably on account of the low number of spirochetes present in the lesion. The positive polymerase chain reaction for lesions from patients with acrodermatis chronica atrophicans supports the concept that B. burgdorferi can persist in the skin {{over a long period of}} time. From these results, it was concluded that the polymerase chain reaction is a valuable technique for the diagnosis of Lyme disease...|$|R

40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi is a causative {{agent of}} Lyme disease in North America and Eurasia. The first {{complete}} genome sequence of B. burgdorferi strain 31, available {{for more than}} a decade, has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relation-ship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 13 additional B. burgdorferi isolates that span the range of natural variation. These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection, diagnosis, and prevention strategies. Lyme disease is the most frequent tick-borne disease in North America and Europe (3, 16, 17). There are multiple variants of B. burgdorferi (1, 7, 15, 20, 21), the causative agent, but questions remain about how their variation correlates with different clinical manifestations.
