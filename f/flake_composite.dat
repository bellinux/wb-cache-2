40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of steel by glass flake (GF) containing coatings {{is widely used}} in marine atmosphere. Eventhough, the coatings conttaining glass flake are highly corrosion resistant, their performance is decreased due {{to the presence of}} pinholes and coating defects. It is well established that polyaniline containing coating is able to protect the pinhole defects in the coatings due to passivating ability of polyaniline. Hence a study has been made on the corrosion protection ability of steel using polyaniline-glass <b>flake</b> <b>composite</b> containing coating with 10 % loading of glass flake in epoxy binder. The polyaniline glass <b>flake</b> <b>composite</b> (PGFC) was synthesized by chemical oxidation of aniline by ammonium persulphate in presence of glass flake. The corrosion protection ability of GF and PGFC containing coating on steel was found out by salt spray test and EIS test in 3 % NaCl. In both the tests, the resistance value of the PGFC containing coating has remained at 10 pow 8 - 10 pow 9 Ohm cm 2 where as for the GF containing coating, the resistance values decreased to 10 pow 5 Ohm cm 2. The enhanced corrosion protection ability of the PGFC coataining coating is due to the passivation ability of the polyaniline present in the coatin...|$|E

This paper presents a new catalyst material fabricated through pulsed EPD, which permitted to acquire a higher efficiency of ethanol electro-oxidation when compared to the catalyst layer fabricated by the DC EPD. The reason behind the enhancement of the performances of the catalyst layers fabricated using the pulsed EPD is the selective deposition of low-weight NiO nanoparticles on nanographitic flakes causing a reduction in the deposition of agglomerated NiO nanoparticles and therefore an enhancement in the efficiency of the ethanol electro-oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Graphite {{has high}} {{in-plane}} thermal conductivity {{and is a}} potential candidate to combat the thermal management problems in high density electronic devices. However, the properties of graphite are not fully exploited and this study was carried out {{with the aim of}} fabricating and analysing high thermally conducting graphite based composites. Model composites were prepared with three different average flake sizes: 180 μm, 300 μm and 600 μm. The constituents(flakes and binders) were characterised in terms of density, carbon yield and crystallographic perfection using combination of techniques. The electrical resistivity of a single flake was found to be 0. 6 μS 2 m. A fabrication route was developed using 75 % starting volume fraction (67 % - 72 %) estimated volume fraction in the <b>composite)</b> of small <b>flake</b> graphite. A high volume fraction was used so as to obtain composites with properties dominated by the flakes. The selection of the optimum route of fabrication was based on achieving the lowest electrical resistivity of the composite after carbonisation (1000 °C). An extensive study was carried out on composites prepared using 75 % (starting volume fraction) flakes. The mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the flake size. The optical texture of small <b>flake</b> <b>composites</b> showed that the binder was inhomogeneously distributed and was observed to shrink away from the flakes whereas in the case of <b>composites</b> with large <b>flakes,</b> the binder was found to wet the flakes. The layers of the binder were also found to align along the basal planes of the flakes {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>flakes.</b> The <b>composites</b> with small <b>flakes</b> were found to be `brittle' whereas the large <b>flake</b> <b>composites</b> showed a more `ductile' behaviour. The Young's modulus and work-of-fracture were estimated from load versus extension curves. Raman studies showed an increase in the a-direction coherence length in the binder with an increase in heat-treatment temperature and the electrical resistivity of the composites was found to decrease with increase in flake size and heat-treatment temperature. The thermal conductivities were determined and samples were imaged in a thermal microscope. Comparison between quantitative thermal conductivity and that predicted using Lavin's relationship showed that Lavin's relationship is not applicable to these composites. A thermal conductivity of 655 W/m K (160 % of that of copper) was achieved in graphitised large <b>flake</b> <b>composites.</b> The volume fraction of graphite was varied (estimated volume fraction 45 %- 75 % in the composite) and graphitised large <b>flake</b> <b>composites</b> were studied. The density of the composites increased with an increase in the volume fraction whereas the mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the estimated volume fraction of graphite up to - 70 %. When the estimated volume fraction of graphite was further increased (- 75 %), the mis-alignment was found to increase. This was attributed to the microstructure which showed high packing density giving rise to twisting and distortion of <b>flakes</b> in the <b>composite.</b> Existing composite-type models failed to correctly predict the transport properties and hence, a first approach to developing a model specifically for these composites was attempted. However, due to their complex nature and insufficient information to define the modelling parameters its validity is uncertain. A thermal conductivity of 750 W/m K (190 % that of copper) and density - 1. 8 g/cm 3 (nearly one fourth of that of copper) and all this at relatively lower cost was achieved in graphitised large <b>flake</b> <b>composites</b> with - 75 % estimated volume fraction of graphite. This material is particularly attractive to combat thermal management problems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{ferromagnetic}} composites {{composed of}} Ni 0. 4 Zn 0. 6 Fe 2 O 4 ferrite powder and Fe particles in an epoxy matrix with various composition ratios were prepared {{by a simple}} mould casting route. Planetary ball milling was then introduced to pre-grind Fe and NiZn ferrite filler mixtures before casting, which resulted in fragmentation of the NiZn ferrites and modification of the Fe morphology from spherical particles to sub-micron <b>flakes.</b> <b>Composites</b> containing the ball-milled fillers exhibited a remarkable improvement in electromagnetic properties over the as-supplied materials, especially in the suppression of dielectric and magnetic loss. By combining the characteristics of high resonant frequency of the Fe and low energy losses of the ferrite, an optimum mixture of ball-milled 15  vol% NiZn ferrite and 38  vol% Fe in a hybrid epoxy-based composite gave an approximately one order of magnitude higher extended operating bandwidth over a ferrite-only containing composite, suppressing dielectric and magnetic loss tangents to approximately 10 − 2 up to 150  MHz without significant deterioration of permeability.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a crystalline phase from the liquid is a nucleation-induced first order phase transformation, but one that cannot be monitored easily nor has it been comprehensively explained at the atomic level. In the context of heterogeneous nucleation, we have found that, during casting of Mgbase glass forming alloys inoculated with micron-sized yttria particles, crystalline Mg nucleates preferentially on a Cu buffer layer that initially forms {{on the surface of}} yttria particles. This partial transformation generated a unique bulk metallic glass / Mg <b>flake</b> <b>composite</b> structure at room temperature exhibiting an excellent combination of high strength and ductility. To understand this transformation at the atomic level, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations have been performed, the structures of the nucleated and nucleant particles have been analyzed and their orientation relationships have been compared with the experimental observations. Furthermore, the local electronic structure at the interface has been examined and the nature of chemical bonding assessed. It is revealed that while the strain generated in Mg structures formed onto the yttria substrate and the Cu buffer layer are comparable, the nucleation is promoted by the {{formation of}} chemical bonding between atomic constituents of the nucleus and nucleant and frustrated if such bonding fails to form. The outcomes of the simulations provide insight into the preferential nucleation of phases at inoculant particles in terms of the interfacial properties such as interfacial lattice mismatch and chemical bonding...|$|E
30|$|For nanocarbons {{which do}} not have the ability to {{naturally}} ionize, some kind of ionic surfactants was introduced to make them negatively charged. By employing SDBS as surfactant during sonication of SWCNT, the nanotubes were not only individually suspended (Fig.  2 c), but also were negatively charged because of the attached dodecylbenzene sulfonate groups (Zeta potential: − 9.5  ±  1.3  mV), making the electrostatic adsorption mechanism available for SWCNT/Al system. Figure  2 d–f shows the surface of the SWCNT/Al <b>flake</b> <b>composite</b> powders loaded with various mass fractions of SDBS-modified SWCNT. With an increasing mass fraction of SWCNT in composite powders, from 0.5 to 2.0 wt%, the nanotube maintains its uniform distribution {{on the surface of the}} Al flakes with few aggregations. Especially, for the modified SWCNT with comparatively large mass fractions, SWCNT was densely packed and well aligned locally as indicated in the inset of Fig.  2 f, revealing a transition from randomly to anisotropic distribution of SWCNT with increasing loadings, indicating an entropy-driven alignment of SWCNT during adsorption [19]. The electrostatic adsorption process is a non-destructive dispersion method, and as shown in the Raman spectrum of Fig.  2 g, the intensity ratio of D and G peaks (0.085) of SDBS-modified SWCNT/Al composite powders, which arise from lattice disorder at the edges of the sp 2 clusters and in-plane stretching of the lattice respectively, shows no apparent increment over SDBS-modified pristine SWCNT (0.084). Besides, on average, the G peak is blue shifted by 2  cm− 1 and the 2 D peak (corresponds to high-energy second-order process) is red shifted by 9  cm− 1 for SWCNT/Al composite powders compared with the surfactant-modified pristine SWCNT (Fig.  2 h), suggesting an electron doping of SWCNT by Al matrix, in accordance with the electron transfer-induced reduction effect of GO by Al flake reported in our previous work [17].|$|E

40|$|Poorly {{crystalline}} carbonaceous {{matter was}} observed in chlorite to sillimanite grade metasediments from the Trois Seigneurs Massif, in contrast to other studies of carbon crystallinity which observed well crystallised graphite under upper greenschist facies conditions. Using transmission electron microscopy four types of carbon particle were identified; globular carbon, <b>composite</b> <b>flakes,</b> homogeneous flakes and crystalline graphite. Globular carbon and <b>composite</b> <b>flakes</b> are poorly crystalline microporous carbon. Homogeneous flakes decompose in the electron beam and are probably composed of heavy volatile hydrocarbons. Graphite is confined to samples from retrograde shear zones and often occurs with globular carbon. The lack of graphitisation in metasediments is probably {{a consequence of the}} microporous structure of the carbonaceous matter combined with low fO 2. The preservation of carbonaceous matter in the Trois Seigneurs metasediments is not compatible with the metasediments having been externally buffered by a high XH 2 O fluid syn-metamorphism.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The need {{to develop}} {{recycling}} solutions for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites has been well established. However, recycled composites remain inferior to composites fabricated with virgin fibers for several reasons. Realistically, recycled composites {{can be expected to}} achieve comparable performance to sheet molding compounds fabricated with virgin fibers if fiber volume fractions can be improved without significantly reducing fiber length. One possible way to achieve this is to fabricate laminates with flakes of cured CFRP. The goal of this research was to investigate the effect of flake geometry on the properties of recycled <b>flake</b> reinforced <b>composites,</b> and to evaluate whether fabricating recycled laminates with CFRP flakes may become a viable alternative to current CFRP recycling techniques. This was accomplished by fabricating and mechanically testing several composite laminates with either shredded flake or single ply flake reinforcement. The shredded material was provided as-shredded by The Boeing Company, and no further processing of the flakes was done prior to resin infusion. The single ply flakes were cured in individual sheets and cut into flakes of different geometries. This flake system was chosen to simulate cured prepreg scrap or delaminated CFRP recyclate, and to provide a well-controlled material system for studying the effects of flake geometry on the properties of <b>flake</b> reinforced <b>composites.</b> The aspect ratio of the singe ply flakes was varied between 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 while either flake area or flake length was held constant.

40|$|Inspired by the {{excellent}} superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning {{properties of the}} lotus leaf, numerous superhydro-oleophobic micro/nanostructures have been developed which mimicked biological systems. These structures have broad applications in industrial processes, especially oil transportation, oil/water separation and anti-fouling applications where oil adhesion is a critical factor. Although the adhesion properties of oils have been well explored {{on a variety of}} surfaces at ambient environment, low temperature behaviors were rarely reported especially when the oil is frozen under a frigid environment. For instance, there are cases in which oils are stuck or frozen onto the walls of engines or pipelines resulting in a large drag force thus leading to excess energy consumption and potential instrument malfunction. In this research project, the initial stage was mainly focused on developing an effective approach to construct well-defined superhydro-oleophobic microstructures and investigating the effects of structures and surface chemistry on superoleophobicity. In this stage, two different chemical modification approaches were applied to both flat and micropillared PDMS: 1) vapour deposition of trichloro (1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyl) silane (FDTS) on cured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer surface (FDTS coated PDMS); 2) blending FDTS with the liquid PDMS precursor before curing (FDTS blended PDMS). Surfaces with varied oleophobicity were fabricated to investigate the effects of superhydro-oleophobicity on the reduction of frozen oil adhesion as characterized by knock-off tests. The relationship between the oleophobicity, which ranged from oleophilic flat surfaces to superoleophobic micropillars, and the reduction of oil adhesion at low temperatures was examined. It was observed that reduced contact angle hysteresis (CAH) led to reduced adhesion strength. By blending FDTS into PDMS micropillars, 60 % adhesion strength reduction compared with flat surfaces was achieved. In order to eliminate the frozen oil effectively, electrical de-freezing was proposed by passing electrical current through the top surface layer to induce joule heating effect. To achieve this, epoxy-silver <b>flakes</b> <b>composite</b> micropillars were developed, demonstrating electrical conductivity and superoleophobicity. The effects of resistivity and superoleophobicity on the reduction and elimination of frozen-oil adhesion have been systematically studied, showing that the larger the resistivity and the oleophobicity, the less force was needed to remove frozen-oil droplet. After developing the electrically conductive polymer composite micropillars for eliminating frozen oil adhesion, we have extended this work, aiming {{to reduce the amount of}} conductive Ag <b>flakes</b> in the <b>composite</b> and make stretchable multifunctional composite elastomers. Electrically conductive and superoleophobic PDMS has been fabricated by embedding Ag flakes (SFs) & Ag nanowires (SNWs) into microstructures of the FDTS-blended PDMS elastomer achieved in the first stage of this project. A series of surface analyses and characterizations showed that highly conductive and superoleophobic surfaces were indeed obtained with a relatively low surface coverage of conductive fillers. A significant improvement to the conductivity was further achieved by using SNWs to partially replace the SFs. The stretchability and conductivity were examined under external strain, which showed that the as-prepared samples are highly stretchable and reversible. The electrical resistance of the SFs/SNWs embedded surface was less dependent on the strain due to the presence of the SNWs, creating a bridging effect and allowing current to flow consistently even as the silver particles were stretched apart from each other. This research demonstrates a simple approach to transform insulating elastomers into functional composites with a desired surface oleophobicity and electrical conductivity, which is of great help for the development multifunctional superoleophobic structures and their applications in oil adhesion reduction at low temperatures...|$|R

Porous preforms possess suitable permeability, good strength and reveal semi-oriented arrangement of fibresand graphite <b>flakes.</b> The <b>composite</b> microstructure exhibit regular arrangement of fibres and rather poor bondingbetween matrix and graphite. Dry wear tests were carried out using a wear tester at constant sliding velocity and under various loads, which inrelation to diameter of specimens corresponds to pressure of P 1 = 0. 81; P 2 = 1. 23; P 3 = 1. 53 MPa.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} research {{we investigated}} thermal properties of {{three groups of}} nanostructured materials: (i) magnetic; (ii) reduced graphene oxide films; and (iii) hybrid magnetic – graphite – graphene composites. The thermal measurements were conducted using the transient “hot disk” and “laser flash” techniques. The rare-earth free nanostructured SrFe 12 O 19 permanent magnets were produced by the current activated pressure assisted densification technique. The thermal conductivity of the nanostructured bulk magnets was found to range from 3. 8 to 5. 6 W/mK for the in-plane and 2. 36 W/mk to 2. 65 W/mK for the cross-plane directions, respectively. The heat conduction was dominated by phonons near the room temperature. The anisotropy of heat conduction was explained by the brick-like alignment of crystalline grains with the longer grain size in-plane direction. The thermal conductivity scales up with the average grain size and mass density of the material revealing weak temperature dependence. Using the nanostructured ferromagnetic Fe 3 O 4 composites as an example system, we incorporated graphene and graphite fillers into magnetic material without changing their morphology. It was demonstrated that addition of 5 wt. % of equal mixture of graphene and graphite <b>flakes</b> to the <b>composite</b> results in a factor of × 2. 6 enhancement of the thermal conductivity without significant degradation of the saturation magnetization. We investigated thermal conductivity of free-standing reduced graphene oxide films subjected to a high-temperature treatment of up to 1000 °C.

The obtained films demonstrated an exceptionally strong anisotropy of the thermal conductivity, K/K ~ 675, which is substantially larger even than in the high-quality graphite. The strongly anisotropic heat conduction properties of these films can be useful for the thermal filler applications.
