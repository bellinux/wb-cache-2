5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

5|$|The Hastings Diesels {{had almost}} {{completely}} replaced steam by June 1958. With {{the introduction of}} the Hastings Diesels, an hourly service was provided. This split at Tunbridge Wells, with the front portion running fast to Crowhurst and the rear portion stopping at all stations. The service ran <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> on Sundays. The Hastings Diesels also worked services on the Bexhill West branch line until closure on 14June 1964. On 22December 1958, 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E
5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, {{an arm of}} National Express, in 2001. Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway (FOSBR) {{and a string of}} protests, services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line, and this has since been increased to three trains <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> (24 trains per day). Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The first railway to Milford Haven {{was with}} the {{completion}} of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland, but after a failure to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford, (Neyland), which was completed in April 1856. The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863, which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway. The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway. Today the town is served by Milford Haven railway station. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Arriva Trains Wales on the West Wales Line. It is the terminus, and from here, trains depart <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> to Manchester Piccadilly via Carmarthen, Swansea, and Cardiff Central.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} vessel Kalava made three cruises to the Laccadive Archipelago during 1958 and 1959 when {{a series of}} stations were operated, details of which jiave been given by Jones (1959). In addition to these, collections were also-made during a cruise of I. N. S. Jumna to the Laccadive waters in January 1959. Plankton collections made during these cruises contained, amongst other forms, several phyllosoma larvae belonging to different species of Palinurids and Scyllarids. """ The present report deals with the phyllosoma of Palinurids and {{an account of the}} Scyllarid phyllosomas and the Nisto stage of a Scyllarus will be published in due course. Fifteen minute horizontal hauls were made simultaneously with a "half frietre organdie net and a one meter net with mosquito netting at the regular stations, whereas at the Anchor stations of Kalava the plankton nets were allowed to drift and collections were made <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hour...</b>|$|R
5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|The American cavalry {{pursued the}} {{soldiers}} that had retreated from Coamo, {{but were not}} able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel S. Reber, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. They slept in improvised huts that did not protect them from the rain.|$|E
