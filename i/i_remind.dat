500|$|Rap-Up {{stated that}} Beyoncé is {{dominant}} over men in [...] "Run the World". [...] "Run the World" [...] {{opens with a}} short piano solo and a heavy beat. Beyoncé chants, [...] "Girls! / We run this mutha / Girls! / Who run the world." [...] It moves into smoother, more persuasive but still boastful lyrics, [...] "I think I need a barber/ None of these ho's can fight me/ I'm so good with this/ <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> you I'm so 'hood with this." [...] She then delivers the repetitive hook and chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings that education gives women strength and independence. Other lyrics of this theme include the line, [...] "smart enough to make these millions, strong enough to bear the children, then get back to business." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said that Beyoncé sings in her signature staccato style on the second verse of the song. She repeats the chorus after the bridge lines and her vocals fade out as the song finishes.|$|E
500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. [...] After Perón ascended to the {{presidency}} in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE), saying Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still {{is the fact that}} they breed idiocy. [...] Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of caudillos, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> readers of Martín Fierro or Don Segundo that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} a May 2012 talk to a {{group of}} Eagle Scouts he {{addressed}} the question “Are we alone? Are there other beings like us in the universe?” He said, “I think the universe is saying to us, 'Take a guess. The answer should be obvious' That could mean the Universe is an unimaginably large space full of a diversity of life and cultures – in the memorable words of Carl Sagan, there are billions and billions of planets like Earth.” He concluded by saying: “Everyday <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> myself of where I am and how we are part of this incredible hum and vibrancy of life. And I feel an immense privilege to be alive now, knowing and enjoying this gift.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making jokes {{about her own}} life and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her joke about {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke." [...] She received multiple death threats throughout her career.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1943 {{and early}} 1944, after most Poles in Volhynia had either been murdered or had fled the area, the {{conflict}} {{spread to the}} neighboring province of Galicia, {{where the majority of}} the population was still Ukrainian, but where the Polish presence was strong. Unlike in the case of Volhynia, where Polish villages were usually destroyed and their inhabitants murdered without warning, in east Galicia Poles were sometimes given the choice of fleeing or being killed. An order by an UPA commander in Galicia stated, [...] "Once more <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> you: first call upon Poles to abandon their land and only later liquidate them, not the other way around"). [...] This change in tactics, combined with better Polish self-defense and a demographic balance more favorable to Poles, resulted in a significantly lower death toll among Poles in Galicia than in Volhynia. The methods used by Ukrainian nationalists in this area were the same, and consisted of rounding up and killing all the Polish residents of the villages, then looting the villages and burning them to the ground. On February 28, 1944, in the village of Korosciatyn 135 Poles were murdered; the victims were later counted by a local Roman Catholic priest, Rev. Mieczysław Kamiński. Jan Zaleski (father of Fr. Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski) who witnessed the massacre, wrote in his diary: [...] "The slaughter lasted almost all night. We heard terrible cries, the roar of cattle burning alive, shooting. It seemed that Antichrist himself began his activity!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Riksdag of the Estates {{was well}} aware that queen Louisa Ulrika was {{responsible}} for the attempted coup d'état, and there were discussions as {{how to deal with the}} queens guilt. In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed". She officially replied the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured [...] "that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom": Troilius reported that [...] "only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best". The Arch Bishop reported, that he observed [...] "tears of rage and sorrow" [...] in her eyes. In private, Louisa Ulrika regarded the reprimand as a humiliating insult, and wrote to her brother Frederick the great, that during the interview she attempted to display [...] "all the coldness, all the contempt possible to make in a demonstration [...] In my hardest moments <b>i</b> <b>remind</b> myself that I am the sister of Frederick the great", and that she regretted nothing but that her revolution had failed. The king was, in the same time, also had a statement read for him by a delegation from the Riksdag, stating that he would be deposed if such an incident was ever to occur again.|$|E
