5000|$|As {{is often}} the case with <b>downhill</b> <b>skis,</b> wood-frame snowshoes and {{suitable}} bindings are typically marketed and purchased separately rather than as a single piece.

5000|$|The Standard was {{flexible}} {{in length and}} stiff in torsion, which allowed it to be easily turned while still holding a good edge. This combination was so impressive that it became known as [...] "The Cheater" [...] for the way it allowed beginners to turn like pros. The Standard, and models that followed it, were so successful that half the <b>downhill</b> <b>skis</b> in the US in the 1960s were Heads.|$|E
50|$|SPD ("Shimano Pedaling Dynamics") - The SPD pedal was {{released}} by Shimano in 1990 and forms {{one part of a}} clipless bicycle shoe/pedal system. While not the first, its innovation was its small cleat which fitted into a recess in the sole of a shoe designed for SPD use. The recess allowed an SPD-equipped shoe to be used for relatively comfortable short walks, whereas previous systems tended to have a large, protruding cleat which prevented this. Clipless pedals use a system of cleat retention which resembles that of <b>downhill</b> <b>skis,</b> allowing for rapid shoe release, ergo clipless pedals are deemed safer than the older style(s) of pedal/shoe integration using toe-straps, et al.|$|E

Main objectives: Evaluate {{prosthetic}} options for people with exarticulation in the knee joint for <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> on two skis. Goals: 1) Suggest prosthetic solutions for <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> with exarticulation {{of the knee}} joint. 2) On the force measuring plate L. A. S. A. R. -Posture, measure gravity center of skier on proposed prosthetic systems and evaluate substantial features for <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing.</b> Method: The work is empirical-theoretical nature. The methods are comparative analysis and observation with subsequent description. The monitored variables were skiers center of gravity position, and angles of the ankle and the knee joint at the neutral position and the base <b>downhill</b> <b>ski</b> position on the power measuring plate L. A. S. A. R. -Posture. Becouse of complexity and uniqueness of this issue, we chose a case study. Results: In our thesis we verify that there are available prothesis in the Czech Republic, which allows to people with exarticulation of the knee joint, safe skiing on two skis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first true}} <b>downhill</b> <b>skis,</b> made in Telemark, Norway by Sondre Norheim, were {{handmade}} from single pieces of hardwood and featured a relatively modest sidecut of about 4 to 5 mm. Alpine ski development after this seminal introduction proceeded {{in a series}} of stepwise improvements; laminate woods, metal edges, metal laminates (see the article on Howard Head) and finally the fibreglass torsion box design were introduced over a period of 100 years. Throughout, little engineering effort had been spent on considering the ski shape, as other issues like torsional stiffness and [...] "chattering" [...] were problems that needed to be solved. Skis of the 1970s were largely identical in shape to those of the 1800s.|$|E
50|$|Pinturault {{was unable}} to make the season start in Sölden in October 2012, as he injured his ankle while playing tennis and had to pause for a three-month period. In December, he won his second World Cup race in a slalom at Val-d'Isère, where he thrilled the home fans with a {{brilliant}} second run under the floodlights to rise from sixth place. He convincingly beat Germany's Felix Neureuther by half a second and future World Cup champion Marcel Hirscher, who led by 0.57 seconds after the first run. Pinturault's third win was at the super-combined in Wengen, Switzerland, where his superior slalom skills were key. After placing 22nd in the downhill portion, he finished 1.15 seconds ahead of Ivica Kostelić of Croatia. The training run for the downhill portion was his first time on <b>downhill</b> <b>skis</b> for months, as he missed pre-season speed training after surgery on his left ankle in August to repair ligaments damaged while playing tennis. Pinturault did not medal {{at the world championships}} in 2013, but had four top-six finishes. A week later he claimed a fourth World Cup win, his first in giant slalom, at Garmisch, Germany. Second after the first run, Pinturault's total time was 0.60 seconds ahead of runner-up Hirscher. On 15 March, he was honored as the 2013 Longines Rising Star, as the top young racer (under 23) of the season.|$|E

Listed are basic elements and characteristics of skis, methods of manufacture, materials for the manufacture of individual parts of the skis and, last but not least, the types of skis. The work is eked out with the analysis of several samples of skis, on which were made cuts, they were observed and structures were compared. The aim of this observation was to determine whether the materials found in the practical section corresponds to the information contained in the theoretical part...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} the epidemiology of sports injuries occurring {{in a community}} during 8 years and to evaluate the outcome of an intervention implemented against injuries occurring in <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing.</b> METHODS [...] Hospital treated sports injuries occurring in Harstad, Norway (population 22 600) were recorded prospectively during an 8 year period. A prevention programme targeting <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> injuries was evaluated. RESULTS [...] 2234 sports injuries accounted for 17. 2 % of recorded unintentional injuries. Two out of three injuries occurred in team sports. Soccer accounted for 44. 8 % of all sports injuries. <b>Downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> injuries had higher mean score on the abbreviated injury scale than all other sports analysed combined (P < 0. 01). Postintervention injury rates for <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> were reduced by 15 % when adjusting for exposure (P = 0. 24). Further observations are needed for assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> safety programme. CONCLUSIONS [...] Strategies for future sports injury prevention include community involvement, particularly sports organisations. Local data analysis seems to justify some priorities, for example, promotion of helmet use in <b>downhill</b> <b>skiing</b> for young adolescents and prevention of lower limb fractures in male soccer players 15 + years old. Prospective hospital recording of injuries provides a tool for the design and outcome evaluation of sports injury intervention research...|$|R
