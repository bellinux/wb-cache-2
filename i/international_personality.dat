5|$|Historically, Sikkim was a British dependency, with {{a status}} {{similar to that}} of the other princely states, and was {{therefore}} considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period. On independence, however, the Chogyal of Sikkim resisted full integration into India. Given the region's strategic importance to India, the Government of India signed first a Standstill Agreement and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of Sikkim which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India. India had responsibility for defence, external affairs and communications, and ultimate responsibility for law and order, but Sikkim was otherwise given full internal autonomy. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, supported by the minority Bhutia and Lepcha upper classes, attempted to negotiate greater powers, particularly over external affairs, to give Sikkim more of an <b>international</b> <b>personality.</b> These policies were opposed by Kazi Lhendup Dorji and the Sikkim State Congress, who represented the ethnic Nepali middle classes and took a more pro-Indian view.|$|E

2500|$|For others, the <b>international</b> <b>personality</b> of the Holy See arises {{solely from}} its {{recognition}} by other states. [...] In this sense, Brownlie {{argues that the}} personality of the Holy See “as a religious organ apart from its territorial base in the Vatican City” arises from the [...] "principle of effectiveness", that is, from the fact that other states voluntarily recognize the Holy See, acquiesce having bilateral relations with it, and in fact do so, in a situation where no rule of ius cogens is breached. [...] For him, though, the <b>international</b> <b>personality</b> thus conferred is effective only towards those states prepared to enter into diplomatic relations with it. Crawford similarly believes that the recognition of a number of states is important evidence to acknowledge the legal personality of the Holy See, so that, today, it cannot be denied.|$|E
2500|$|For some authors, {{the current}} legal {{personality}} of the Holy See is a remnant of its preeminent role in medieval politics. Thus Arangio-Ruiz noted that the Holy See has been an actor {{in the evolution of}} international law since before the creation of strong nation states, and that it has maintained <b>international</b> <b>personality</b> since.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{third group}} of authors, the {{international}} legal personality of the Holy See is based mostly, but not only, on its unique spiritual role. Araujo notes, for instance, that [...] "it is generally understood that the Holy See’s <b>international</b> <b>personality</b> emerges from its religious, moral and spiritual authority and mission {{in the world as}} opposed to a claim over purely temporal matters. This is an incomplete understanding, however, of the grounds on which its claim as a subject of international law can be justified", since, in his view, the Holy See’s claim to <b>international</b> <b>personality</b> can also be justified [...] {{by the fact that it}} is recognized by other states as a full subject of international law. The Lateran Treaty itself seems to support this view. In article 2, Italy recognized [...] "the sovereignty of the Holy See in the international domain as an attribute inherent in its nature, in accordance with its tradition and with the requirements of its mission in the world." ...|$|E

[...] "Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose {{from the table and}} strutted away.
