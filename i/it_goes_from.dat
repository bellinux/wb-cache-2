2500|$|As {{with most}} second strains, this one {{features}} more rapidly changing chords. Note {{the use of}} the IV chord, used in marches to create a very [...] "uplifting" [...] and lyrical sound which will tend to resolve back to the I chord or proceed into the V chord, as it does here. At measure ten, where it restates the main theme, Sousa uses a rather [...] "deceptive" [...] chord change. Instead of using F to G7 to C as he did in measures two and three, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> the IV (F) to the V7/VI (E7, secondary dominant), to the VI (Am). The main melodic theme uses the same notes, but revolves around a different harmonic progression, resulting in greater chordal interest (less repetitive). Sousa then uses his trademark chromatic accented chord (A♭7; note that it is a half-step below the previous chord) to create a [...] "wall of tension" [...] that quickly resolves into the I chord.|$|E
2500|$|Communication {{is spread}} across a medium using {{different}} modes, like a blog post accompanied with images and an embedded video. These modes all work to construct meaning through {{this concept of}} multimodality. With the introduction of these modes comes the notion of transforming the message. This transformation is accomplished by taking the message of one mode and displaying it in or with another, such as taking a text and incorporating it into a video. However, the message may have been transformed or changed as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> one medium to the next. The video could now act {{as a supplement to}} the text, much like special features on a DVD, or it could become a piece that reiterates or supports the text, just in a different format. This reshaping of information from one mode to another is known as transduction. [...] As information changes from one mode to the next, how that message is comprehended is attributed to multiliteracy, as the text is understood across a variety of different means.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2011, Aston Martin {{released}} the V8 Vantage S, available in both coupe and Roadster variants, {{and designed to}} produce a more sporty experience than the standard V8 Vantage. The engine is the same 4.7-liter aluminum V-8 found in the base Vantage, but with improved intake airflow, new mufflers, and new programming that keeps the exhaust system’s bypass valves open longer. The net is 430hp and 361lb-ft of torque, gains of 10hp and 15lb-ft. The improvements mean <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> 0 to 60mph in 4.0 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the base model. Engine output flows through a new single-clutch seven-speed Graziano automated manual to a limited-slip rear differential; the carbon fiber driveshaft spins in an aluminum torque tube. From there, power {{is applied to the}} pavement via a set of(285/35) Bridgestone Potenzas on 19-inch cast aluminum wheels. Bushings, springs, and dampers were stiffened for the S model and the steering rack is quicker than in the base model. The result of all these put together is an exceptional level of response. The aerodynamic enhancements include a deeper front bumper with carbon fibre splitter, larger side sills, a carbon fibre diffuser and a larger tailgate lip designed to sharpen the handling on the road. [...] Additional visual differences include new wheels.|$|E

2500|$|The Lerma River {{flows from}} Lake Almoloya del Río {{through the center}} of the {{municipality}} towards the west, flowing into Lake Chapala. From this point westward the river takes the name of Río Grande de Santiago. And <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> this lake to the Pacific Ocean in the state of Nayarit. The river is about long; about 60% of it is known as Lerma River and 40% as Santiago River. The Nevado de Toluca or Xinantécatl is [...] southwest of the city. The god Tolo was supposed to reside in the volcano's crater. Its original indigenous name wasChignahualtecatl which means [...] "Nine Mountains" [...] but later was named Xinantecatl which means [...] "naked man", because the silhouette of its crater resembles a sleeping man, before the Spaniards named it Nevado, meaning [...] "snow-covered". It is a place of increasing sporting activity, such as mountain biking, climbing, and high altitude running. It is the only volcano in Mexico that has two lagoons and can be reached by automobile. There have been proposals to turn this mountain into a ski hill because of its accessibility and the low temperatures that exist on the mountain throughout the year, but recent reports on global warming have raised fears that the snow cap on the mountain will disappear completely within a few decades. The area was converted into the Nevado de Toluca National Park in January 1936 with about in area. The park has forest land, especially of pines and obeto trees. The prevalent animals are camp rats, teporingos, squirrels, tlacuaches, lizards, snakes, and eagles. On the lower part of this mountain there are picnic tables and BBQ grills. In the higher part of the volcano (inside) there are two lagoons in which visitors can practice scuba-diving and fishing. This volcano is unique in Mexico in that one can enter the crater by car.|$|E

I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> there.’’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>from</b> white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually 1 to 5 flowers are produced at a time.|$|E
