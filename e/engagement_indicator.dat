The strongest positive correlation was between learning engagement and learning approach (r =  0.68, p <  0.01), while the correlation between learning engagement and learning achievement was relatively weak (r =  0.27, p <  0.05). Positive correlations also existed among different evaluation indicators. For example, citizen reading was significantly correlated with learning approach (r =  0.64, p <  0.01) and its three evaluation indicators, i.e., citizen’s mobile learning (r =  0.59, p <  0.01), self-regulated learning (r =  0.43, p <  0.01), and utilization of city online learning platform (r =  0.56, p <  0.01).

The aim of the review process was to transform the level of student engagement in the business faculty of an Australian university. The process took a collaborative approach through consultation with academic staff involved in the design and delivery of the units under review, and included targeted professional development as necessary. An institutional framework that characterises <b>engagement</b> <b>indicator</b> contexts and their attributes facilitated dialog during the review process.

30|$|The {{approach}} {{in the present study}} expands upon previous work by using a model-based method to define a continuous latent variable of test-taking engagement. Specifically, (item response) measurement models are used to investigate whether binary indicator variables representing (non-)solution behavior for a person and an item constitute a common continuous latent variable. The concept of RTE proposes that test-takers’ engagement when proceeding through a test differs continuously. In line with this, Setzer et al. (2013) analyzed binary solution-behavior indicators by means of a hierarchical generalized linear model including random intercepts for person and institution (but without random item intercepts or explanatory person and item variables). Thus, our first goal was to test whether there are actually systematic person differences in disengagement across test items that can be captured by a latent variable. Providing evidence that a measurement model can be established would also justify summing across indicator variables, as is done when computing the RTE measure. If the uni-dimensional 1 -parameter logistic (1 PL or Rasch) model holds, the sum score accurately represents the 1 PL person parameter (Rost 2004). A model-based approach is also beneficial for complex test designs (e.g., multi-matrix design, adaptive test design) such as PIAAC, where different test-takers complete different item sets within a domain, and summing across different sets of <b>engagement</b> <b>indicator</b> variables may not provide comparable measures.|$|E

Researchers found that incorporating gamified elements into courses, such as giving students digital rewards (e.g., redeemable points, trophies, and badges) for participating in learning activities or creating competition {{through the use of}} leaderboards where students can see how they rank against other students positively affects student motivation to complete learning tasks (Armier et al., 2016; Chang & Wei, 2016; Hew et al., 2016; Nadolny & Halabi, 2016). In addition, students who participated in gamified elements, such as trying to earn digital badges, were more motivated to complete particularly difficult learning activities (Hew et al., 2016) and showed persistence in exceeding learning requirements (Ibáñez et al., 2014). Research on emotional engagement may help to explain these findings. Studies suggest that digital games positively affect student attitudes about learning, evident in student reports that games are fun, interesting, and enjoyable (Beckem & Watkins, 2012; Farley, 2013; Grimley et al., 2012; Hew et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011; Zimmermann, 2013), which may account for higher levels of student motivation in courses that offered digital games.|$|E
40|$|The Teach Less, Learn More (TLLM) {{movement}} (Ministry of Education, 2005) {{focuses on}} the quality of interaction between the learners and the teacher. It means teaching better so that students are better engaged during the learning process. This study is one school’s response to this call. The school developed RI 3 CH TASKS, which were transdisciplinary and they engaged students in pragmatic social action through working on authentic problems. These authentic problems also required students to use the higher order skills of analysis and applications. Three classes of Grade 7 students were exposed to RI 3 CH TASKS for five months. In this project, students were assessed on sub-tasks and these assessments contributed to the assessment of their culminating product. The students were given feedback on their performance in sub-tasks in a timely and specific manner to allow for self-adjustments on the students ’ part (Wiggins, 1998). This study seeks to find out the relationship between engaged learning and the instructional practices, specifically in using assessment to improve learning. The PETALSTM <b>Engagement</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PEI) questionnaire was used to measure students’ engagement before and after intervention via the RI 3 CH TASKS. The different scales of the PEI questionnaire for engaged learning were also measured before and after the students participated in this study. There was a moderate effect size in the Pedagogy (P) scale and small effect size on the Experience of Learning (E), Assessment (A) and Learning Content (L) scales. A correlational analysis performed between the P, E, T, A, L scales and Engagement scale showed A and L having high correlation coefficients with the Overall Engagement (GG).

5000|$|Students’ {{responses}} in the survey have been categorized into ten <b>Engagement</b> <b>Indicators</b> (EIs) and narrowly concentrated among four general themes: academic challenge, learning withpeers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment. NSSEs ten <b>Engagement</b> <b>Indicators</b> include:higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, learning strategies, quantitative reasoning, learning with peers, discussions with diverse others, experiences with faculty, effective teaching practices, quality of interactions, and supportive environments. Moreover, NSSE provides results on six High-Impact practices (HIPs) that are duly noted for their positive outcomes on student learning and retention. [...] These HIPs are known by researchers as educational experiences that shift one’s trajectory of success in college. The HIPs refer to: learning community, service-learning, research with faculty (effective for first-year student and seniors), internship or field experience, study abroad, and culminating senior experience that seniors should engage in (e.g. capstone project). In 2008, George Kuh suggested that all students should experience at least one HIP during their first-year and one during senior year.

40|$|Background: Health care {{professionals}} {{are at risk}} of developing burnout due to the inherently stressful nature of their work. Burnout has been found to compromise the wellbeing of health {{care professionals}} and their ability to provide optimal patient care. Job engagement is proposed to be the antipode of burnout and is concerned with occupational well-being. It is hoped that through a better understanding of factors related to job engagement and burnout, occupational well-being of health care professionals and their ability to care for patients can be improved. Systematic review: A systematic review of the literature on burnout and job engagement in physicians and nurses since 2002 identified seven studies. Findings suggest that burnout and job engagement are independent constructs, albeit negatively related. These findings contribute to the current knowledge about the relationships between burnout and engagement dimensions and provide a framework for interventions aimed at increasing occupational well-being among front line medical professionals. Aims: A study was conducted to assess levels of job engagement and burnout and their relationship with turnover intentions and job satisfaction and stress in the entire workforce of a Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom. Participants and procedure: 150 cancer care workers completed a cross-sectional questionnaire entailing the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the <b>Engagement</b> <b>Indicator,</b> measures of job satisfaction, stress, turnover intentions and demographics. Results: Mean scores of emotional exhaustion did not differ from normative data, while lower levels of depersonalisation and lack of accomplishment were found. Furthermore, engagement scores were significantly higher than in the normative sample and the majority reported high levels of job satisfaction and indicated no turnover intentions. Path analysis provided preliminary support for an exploratory model indicating that engagement mediates the relationship between job stress, burnout and job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Implications: It is important that, despite increasing pressure to reduce costs, service planning is mindful of the continuous and long-term process required to maintain and facilitate engagement and job satisfaction, which appear important to the long term retention of staff. Conclusions: Work overload and a perception of being poorly managed and resourced appear to be risk factors for burnout. However, engaged employees with high levels of personal accomplishment may experience job satisfaction and desire to stay in their jobs despite high levels of occupational stress. Further research is required to identify factors predictive of personal accomplishment and job engagement in oncology services...|$|E
40|$|A policy-oriented {{review of}} {{strategies}} {{for improving the}} outcomes of services for substance use disorder patients. Humphreys K., McLellan T. Addiction: 2011, 106, p. 2058 – 2066. Improving performance of substance use disorder treatment systems is no easy matter and one prone to unintended consequences. All the more welcome then is guidance from leading US experts with top-level experience in the UK and the USA; their favourite tactic, rewarding services for patient progress during treatment, is featured in UK payment-by-results schemes. Summary Two US experts who worked at top levels on drug policy for the current US president and have advised the UK government draw on scientific literature and their experiences to offer policy makers an overview of system-level strategies to improve the outcomes of services for substance use disorder patients. Their aim was to stimulate discussion rather than conduct a systematic and comprehensive review of the evidence. Though they may be used together, the review divides the strategies in to process-focused quality improvement strategies which change how treatment staff work in the expectation that this will improve patient outcomes, and patient-focused strategies which concentrate on outcomes without specifying how those are to be achieved.

It should have improved relationships between counsellors and clients and between counsellors and their clinics, but a sophisticated system for feeding back client progress made no positive difference {{on any of these}} measures.

Confirmation that the failure to improve outcomes of a system for feeding back client progress to counsellors was probably due to aggregating outcomes across the counsellor's caseload rather than enabling them to identify and take recommended actions in respect of individuals doing poorly.

In addition, low job control was stress-exacerbating. However, contrary to expectations, for those high in non-self-determination, high job control was just as useful as low job control as a stress-buffer.

30|$|There is {{far less}} {{evidence}} in the literature {{about the use of}} Facebook for emotional and cognitive engagement. In terms of emotional engagement, studies suggest that students feel positively about being part of a course-specific Facebook group and that Facebook is useful for expressing feelings about learning and concerns for peers, through features such as the “like” button and emoticons (Bowman & Akcaoglu, 2014; Dougherty & Andercheck, 2014; Naghdipour & Eldridge, 2016). In addition, being involved in a course-specific Facebook group was positively related to students’ sense of belonging in the course (Dougherty & Andercheck, 2014). The research on cognitive engagement is less conclusive, with some studies suggesting that Facebook participation is related to academic persistence (Fagioli et al., 2015) and self-regulation (Dougherty & Andercheck, 2014) while other studies show low levels of knowledge construction in Facebook posts (Hou et al., 2015), particularly when compared to discussions held in the LMS. One possible reason may be because the LMS is associated with formal, academic interactions while Facebook is associated with informal, social interactions (Camus et al., 2016). While additional research is needed to confirm the efficacy of Facebook for promoting cognitive engagement, studies suggest that Facebook may be a viable tool for increasing specific behavioral and emotional <b>engagement</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as interactions with others and a sense of belonging within a learning community.|$|R

With the increase in the United States, incoming immigrant population it is important to address the issue of immigrant children entering school less prepared then native children. There is a lack of research examining the link between mother-infant interactions in relation to the promotion of infant receptive language within the immigrant population. This study examines the relationship between immigrant mother’s early cognitive engagement and sensitivity with their infants, during mother-infant play and the infant’s later receptive language and the influence of maternal education. A total of 19 immigrant mothers of Latino, African, Caribbean and Asian Pacific Island background were videotaped playing with their infants in order to determine the level of cognitive engagement and sensitivity provided. Data analysis of the coding scores revealed that there was a distinctive difference in the level of maternal education in relation to cognitive engagement and sensitivity. Results determined that receptive language was not associated with parenting behaviors: sensitivity and cognitive <b>engagement.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of cultural variations within the sample could have influenced the results. Future research needs to extend this study in order to determine the longitudinal effects of parenting behaviors of immigrant mothers and their children’s receptive language...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the level of student {{engagement}} for undergraduate students with and without psychological disabilities. George Kuh (2009) examined the benefits and impact of student engagement in supporting retention, student success and enhancing the overall collegiate experience. The study provides an analysis of the level of engagement according to the four <b>engagement</b> <b>indicators</b> as identified and assessed by the National Survey for Student Engagement (NSSE). These themes are academic challenge, learning with peers, experiences with faculty, campus environment to also include high-impact practices. This study compares an analysis of the level of engagement for students with psychological disabilities as compared with their non-identified peers overall and by institution. Students with disabilities continue to enroll in institutions of higher education and are considered an underrepresented population. Many students, especially those with psychological disabilities often encounter unwelcoming environments upon entering many institutions and may not feel connected to the campus community. In order to create engaging, inclusive and supportive environments for all students, institutions should be committed to minimizing barriers and ensuring accessibility in every aspect of the student experience. Determining the level of engagement or the lack thereof is one intentional way to understand this particular diverse group of students in order to inform institutions on ways to create and implement intentional ways to support meaningful engagement and success for all students...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAssessment of {{disaster}} resilience using an index {{is often a}} key element of natural hazard management and planning. Many assessments have been undertaken worldwide. Emerging from these are a set of seven common properties that should be considered in the design of any disaster resilience assessment: assessment purpose, top-down or bottom-up assessment, assessment scale, conceptual framework, structural design, indicator selection, data analysis and index computation and reporting and interpretation. We introduce the design of an Australian Natural Disaster Resilience Index (ANDRI) according to the common properties of resilience assessment. The ANDRI takes a top-down approach using indicators derived from secondary data with national coverage. The ANDRI is a hierarchical design based on coping and adaptive capacities representing the potential for disaster resilience. Coping capacity is the means by which people or organizations use available resources, skills and opportunities to face adverse consequences {{that could lead to a}} disaster. Adaptive capacity is the arrangements and processes that enable adjustment through learning, adaptation and transformation. Coping capacity is divided into themes of social character, economic capital, infrastructure and planning, emergency services, community capital and information and engagement. Adaptive capacity is divided into themes of governance, policy and leadership and social and community <b>engagement.</b> <b>Indicators</b> are collected to determine the status of each theme. As assessments {{of disaster}} resilience develop worldwide, reporting of their design as standard practice will track knowledge generation in the field and enhance the relationship between applied disaster resilience assessment and foundational principles of disaster resilience...|$|R
30|$|Studies {{pertaining}} to specific behavioral student <b>engagement</b> <b>indicators</b> also reveal mixed findings. For example, in studies where course-related Twitter use was voluntary, 45 - 91 % of students reported using Twitter during the term (Hennessy et al., 2016; Junco et al., 2013; Ross, Banow, & Yu, 2015; Tiernan, 2014; Williams & Whiting, 2016), but only 30 - 36 % reported making {{contributions to the}} course-specific Twitter page (Hennessy et al., 2016; Tiernan, 2014; Ross et al., 2015; Williams & Whiting, 2016). The study that reported a 91 % participation rate was unique because the course-specific Twitter page was accessible via a public link. Therefore, students who chose only to view the content (58 %), rather than contribute to the page, {{did not have to}} create a Twitter account (Hennessy et al., 2016). The convenience of not having to create an account may be one reason for much higher participation rates. In terms of low participation rates, a lack of literacy, familiarity, and interest in Twitter, as well as a preference for Facebook, are cited as contributing factors (Bista, 2015; McKay et al., 2014; Mysko & Delgaty, 2015; Osgerby & Rush, 2015; Tiernan, 2014). However, when the use of Twitter was required and integrated into class discussions, the participation rate was 100 % (Gagnon, 2015). Similarly, 46 % of students in one study indicated that they would have been more motivated to participate in Twitter activities if they were graded (Osgerby & Rush, 2015), again confirming the power of extrinsic motivating factors.|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{political}} development of adolescents is mainly focused on political <b>engagement</b> <b>indicators,</b> i. e. interest, knowledge and participation, and formation {{of political and social}} attitudes. The more complex relationship between attitudes and political preferences is less studied in this age group. Especially the link with party preferences is scarce, as electoral studies do not include citizens under the legal voting age in their analyses. We argue that the age of eighteen is too late to start investigating the attitudinal basis of vote choice. In this paper, we investigate whether there is a substantively logical link between social attitudes and vote choice – which has earlier been theoretically conceptualized as ‘correct voting’ – by embedding this theoretical question in the larger debate on voting age and political maturity. We observe correct voting for three Flemish parties with a clear-cut ideological profile – the Green party, the extreme-rightist party and the Flemish Nationalist party – among Flemish adolescents. The data stem from the Parent-Child Socialization Study (PCSS 2012), a representative survey covering the attitudes and political behavior of 15 -year old adolescents and both their parents. The findings indicate a significant link between the social attitudes and vote choice among adolescents. This ability to vote correctly is reinforced by the level of political sophistication of the adolescent. These results suggest that including adolescents in the electorate would not negatively affect the input legitimacy of the democratic system. However, the correspondence between social attitudes and vote choice was not impressive and lower than among experienced adults, leaving room for other influential factors. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} {{on the use of}} Twitter for cognitive and emotional engagement is minimal but nonetheless promising in terms of promoting knowledge gains, the practical application of content, and a sense of belonging among users. For example, using Twitter to respond to questions that arose in lectures and tweet about course content throughout the term is associated with increased understanding of course content and application of knowledge (Kim et al., 2015; Tiernan, 2014; West et al., 2015). While the underlying mechanisms pertaining to why Twitter promotes an understanding of content and application of knowledge are not entirely clear, Tiernan (2014) suggests that one possible reason may be that Twitter helps to break down communication barriers, encouraging shy or timid students to participate in discussions that ultimately are richer in dialogue and debate. In terms of emotional engagement, students who participated in a large, class-specific Twitter page were more likely to feel a sense of community and belonging compared to those who did not participate because they could more easily find support from and share resources with other Twitter users (Ross et al., 2015). Despite the positive findings about the use of Twitter for cognitive and emotional engagement, more studies are needed to confirm existing results regarding behavioral engagement and target additional <b>engagement</b> <b>indicators</b> such as motivation, persistence, and attitudes, interests, and values about learning. In addition, given the strong negative perceptions of Twitter that still exist, additional studies are needed to confirm Twitter’s efficacy for promoting different types of behavioral engagement among both novice and experienced Twitter users, particularly when compared to more familiar tools such as Facebook or LMS discussion forums.|$|R
