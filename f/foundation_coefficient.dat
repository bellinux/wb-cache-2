Asymptotic solutions have been constructed for the following cases: for an arbitrary value of the elastic <b>foundation</b> <b>coefficient</b> at small and large time values, and for small and large coefficients of the elastic foundation at arbitrary times. Also a special case originated from an ageing process has been studied. The ageing process is described by an expression approximating some well-known experimental data.

In this paper, the power-series method was employed to investigate the performance of a geocell-reinforced mattress under symmetric loads. The geocell-reinforced mattress was idealized as a beam on a Winkler foundation. In the analysis, the soil-foundation beam interface resistance, related to the horizontal deformation coupling with the vertical deformation, was considered. Semi-analytic solutions were developed to assess the deformations and internal forces of the foundation beam and verified against an existing finite element method [9].

There are numerous assumptions leading to different simplifications in railway track modelling. The rails are modelled as infinite Timoshenko beams, sleepers by lumped masses or elastic bodies and ballast as a visco-elastic foundation.

The fundamental qualitative difference between the track with classic or Y sleepers is related to local longitudinal symmetric or antymetric features of railway track. The sleeper spacing influences the periodicity of elastic <b>foundation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> mass density (rotational inertia) and shear effective rigidity. The track with classical concrete sleepers is influenced much more by rotational inertia and shear deflections than the track with Y sleepers.

40|$|The {{problem of}} a beam resting on elastic {{foundation}} often occurs {{in the analysis of}} building, geotechnical, highway, and railroad structures. Its solution demands modeling of the mechanical behavior of the beam, the mechanical behavior of the soil as elastic subgrade and the form of interaction between the beam and the soil. The oldest, most famous and most frequently used mechanical model is the one devised by Winkler (1867), in which the beam-supporting soil is modeled as a series of closely spaced, mutually independent, linear elastic vertical springs, which, evidently, provide resistance in direct proportion to the deflection of the beam. The solution is presented for the {{problem of a}}n Euler–Bernoulli beam supported by an infinite two-parameter Pasternak foundation. The beam is subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated vertical loading along its length. Static response of a beam on an elastic foundation characterized by two parameters is investigated assuming, that the beam is subjected to external loads and two concentrated edge load. The governing equations of the problem are obtained and solved by pointing out that there is a concentrated edge foundation reaction in addition to a continuous foundation reaction along the beam axis in the case of complete contact in the foundation reactions of the two-parameter foundation model. The proposed method is based on the properties of Fourier transforms of the finite functions. Particular attention is paid to the problem, taking into account the deformation of soil areas outside the beam.

40|$|AbstractRock masses are {{commonly}} used as the underlying layer of important structures such as bridges, dams and transportation constructions. The success of a foundation design for such structures mainly depends on the accuracy of estimating the bearing capacity of rock beneath them. Several traditional numerical approaches are proposed for the estimation of the bearing capacity of foundations resting on rock masses to avoid performing elaborate and expensive experimental studies. Despite this fact, there still exists a serious need to develop more robust predictive models. This paper proposes new nonlinear prediction models for the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations resting on non-fractured rock masses using a novel evolutionary computational approach, called linear genetic programming. A comprehensive set of rock socket, centrifuge rock socket, plate load and large-scaled footing load test results is used to develop the models. In order to verify {{the validity of the}} models, the sensitivity analysis is conducted and discussed. The results indicate that the proposed models accurately characterize the bearing capacity of shallow <b>foundations.</b> The correlation <b>coefficients</b> between the experimental and predicted bearing capacity values are equal to 0. 95 and 0. 96 for the best LGP models.

40|$|Natural soil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{variable}} materials as a result of physical and chemical changes. The variation in soil properties significantly affects the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of a footing. This effect is further complicated by considering the spatial correlation of the soil properties. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the spatial variability of a clay on the bearing capacity of a buried footing. The spatial variation of undrained shear strength of a clay is modelled by random fields. The random fields are generated and mapped into a non-linear finite element analysis. The failure mechanism and bearing capacity of a footing in a spatially random soil can then be revealed. Finally a Monte Carlo simulation is employed to investigate the effect of spatial variability on the buried footing. The random fields with different scales of fluctuation are modelled to reveal the effects of spatial variability. It is found that the mean values of bearing capacity of the foundation are the smallest when the scale of fluctuation is 0. 1 - 1 times of <b>foundation</b> width. The <b>coefficient</b> of variation of the bearing capacity increases with increasing scale of fluctuation. When the scale of fluctuation is on the order of the foundation width the variation in bearing capacity is mainly due to the different shear paths developed in the random soil. When the scale of fluctuation is much larger than the foundation width, the variation in bearing capacity is mainly due to the distinct soil strength in different realization...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the dynamic stability of functionally graded material (FGM) plates under parametric excitation. Third order shear deformation theory {{is used for the}} analysis of the plates. The equations of motion have been derived using finite element method in conjunction with Hamilton’s principle. The boundaries of stable and unstable regions in the parameter space are determined by using Floquet’s theory. FGMs are microscopically inhomogeneous spatial combination of materials, usually made up of ceramic and metal constituents. A steel-alumina FGM plate with steel-rich bottom and alumina reach top is considered for the analysis. The properties of the functionally graded material plates are assumed to vary along the thickness direction, according to a power law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. The effect of power law index on the critical buckling load, natural frequencies and dynamic stability of plates is determined. In case of FGM plate, an increase of power law index value decreases the natural frequencies. If aspect ratio is increased, the critical buckling load decreases for both uniaxial and biaxial loading cases and it is also observed that increase of power law index value decreases critical buckling load. With increase of the power index there is deteriorating effect on the dynamic stability of the FGM plate. The influence of temperature rise on the dynamic stability of the FGM plate in thermal environment is investigated. The natural frequencies and dynamic stability behaviour are found to be highly sensitive to the temperature change between the bottom and top surfaces. In high temperature environment the dynamic stability of the plate deteriorates. The effect of <b>foundation</b> stiffness <b>coefficients</b> on the dynamic stability of FGM plates are examined in detail through parametric studies. The frequencies of FGM plate resting on Pasternak foundation increase with the increase of Winkler foundation constant and shear layer constant. The Winkler and shear foundation constants have significant effect on the critical buckling load of FGM plates resting on Pasternak foundation. An increase of these constants increases the critical buckling load of the plate. Increase of Winker foundation constant and shear layer constant improves the dynamic stability of FGM plate. Shear layer constant has got more prominent effect compared to the Winkler foundation constant, on the dynamic stability of FGM plate resting on Pasternak foundation. Parametric investigation is carried out to study thoroughly the effect of the temperature rise, hub radius and rotational speed on the vibration and dynamic stability of rotating plate in iii thermal environment. It is observed that the natural frequencies reduce with an increase in temperature rise. The increase in rotational speed and hub radius results in increase of natural frequencies. The increase in temperature leads to reduction in the dynamic stability of plate. Increase in hub radius and rotational speed improves the stability of the rotating plate. The effects of moisture concentration, temperature rise and power law index on the dynamic stability of FGM plates in hygrothermal environment are investigated. The observations made from the dynamic stability diagrams are: with increase in moisture concentration and temperature the instability of the plate is more probable, the combined effect of moisture and temperature on the dynamic instability of FGM plates is more severe than the effect of individual parameter. The effect of skew angle on dynamic stability of FGM plate in thermal environment is discussed. The natural frequencies increase with an increase of skew angle. Increase in aspect ratio of FGM skew plate increases its instability. The increase in the value of power law index is found to have enhancing effect on the parametric instability of the skew FGM plate. The increase in skew angle of the plate reduces the chance of dynamic instability of the plate...|$|R
