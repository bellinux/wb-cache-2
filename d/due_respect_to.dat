5|$|The triumphal archway at the {{boundary}} between Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera {{is known as the}} Wignacourt Arch or the Fleur-de-Lys Gate. It has three doorways, and it is adorned with Wignacourt's coat of arms and three sculpted fleurs-de-lis, the heraldic symbols of Wignacourt. The suburb of Fleur-de-Lys got its name from this arch, and fleurs-de-lis are featured on the flags and coat of arms of both Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. One of the original plaques on the arch gave <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the engineer Bontadino de Bontadini. The arch together with the aqueduct's water towers and fountains were the first expression of baroque architecture in Malta.|$|E

It is expected, however, that the national flag will be treated at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it. The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E
25|$|While he {{supported}} the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in 2010, Miller {{commented on}} his {{approach}} to playing standards, which was more conservative than that of many others: [...] "I believe in giving <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the melody, playing it as true as possible, [...] a solo is a creative process that improves the melody." [...] He almost never transcribed recordings (something that jazz musicians are typically taught to do); Miller credited this with slowing his learning process, but also with allowing him to express himself more freely, as he reached his own understanding of the compositions he played.|$|E

500|$|The song follows in a {{tradition}} established by singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument. The lyrics {{also serve as}} an example of a dialogue that was commonplace during the 1970s between songwriters and music critics. Contributing to Harrison's sense of injustice in [...] "This Guitar", he and his tour musicians believed that detractors had ignored the successful aspects of the 1974 shows – which blended rock, jazz, funk and Indian classical music – and had focused instead on his failure to pay <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the legacy of the Beatles. Rolling Stones scathing assessment of Harrison's tour and accompanying album, Dark Horse, represented an about-face by the publication, previously one of his most vocal supporters, and led to Harrison's continued resentment towards the magazine over subsequent decades.|$|E
500|$|Cardozo {{has been}} praised for {{his style of}} writing in Palsgraf. Posner noted that in {{the facts of the}} case Cardozo [...] "saw {{instantiated}} the basic principles of negligence law and was able to articulate them in prose of striking freshness, clarity, and vividness", in an opinion mostly written in short sentences and lacking footnotes or block quotes. University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kim Lane Scheppele noted that the opinion was [...] "written by Judge Benjamin Cardozo at the height of his formidable powers". Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, [...] "Cardozo had a genius for making it seem that the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable". Prosser stated, [...] "with <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the superlative style in which both [...] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation." [...] Herzog was also less enthusiastic, noting that [...] "the majority opinion is unfortunately written in the curious idiolect I sometimes call Cardozo-speak." ...|$|E

In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say with all <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have most}} often {{compared}} {{the film to}} landmark youth films Breathless (also 1960)—released in France five months earlier—directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955), although, Bryan Hartzheim found it takes its youths more seriously and with less sympathy. He stated, [...] " [...] a wrecking ball to what can be considered the indulgencies of the [...] genre, an exhibition of the horrors of uninhibited youth taken to its carnal extremes and matched by a visual accompaniment akin to the abstract and improvised style of a Miles Davis score." [...] Tim Lucas of Video Watchdog magazine called the film [...] "an important rediscovery on many fronts... {{one of the great}} jazz films, and possibly the best illustration the cinema has ever given us of the jazz buff. It's the only film I've ever seen that makes jazz seem scarier than the darkest heavy metal, that makes jazz seem dangerous." [...] For TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion, Alvin Lu commended the score as [...] "stunning" [...] and Kawachi's performance as [...] "ferocious, the very incarnation of the kind of social chaos that could be engendered by too much exposure to jazz, Coke, and hot dogs." [...] The Boston Globe's Wesley Morris wrote, [...] " [...] Kurahara takes the movie to extremes of behavior and style, merging the two until the form seems as violently unstable as the characters. He makes a wave that in Europe was called 'French' and 'new.' But with all <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jean-Luc Godard, this is breathless - and more interesting, too." [...] Morris further qualified that while Breathless may appeal to contemporary viewers academically, The Warped Ones retains a spontaneous, documentary feel. Schilling discerned the film, [...] "Among [...] boldest departures from studio convention." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the problems, {{the tour}} was a success, and Lloyd {{performed}} to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition." [...] Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying [...] "until we meet again". [...] She was reported in The Morning Telegraph as saying: [...] "With all <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." [...] Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, [...] the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, [...] " [...] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered." ...|$|E

500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback took a big step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With all <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{clear-cut}} {{division between}} the Germans and some other minorities, whose heritage is similar in some <b>respects</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> centuries of assimilation, Germanisation and intermarriage, but differs in other <b>respects</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> either ancient regional West Slavic roots or Polonisation.
