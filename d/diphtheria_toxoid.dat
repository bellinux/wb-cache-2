40|$|AIMS [...] A {{series of}} {{patients}} with myeloma were investigated to assess whether immunological risk factors predisposing to serious infection could be identified. METHODS [...] Patients (n = 102) with predominantly plateau phase myeloma were monitored prospectively for infections. Immunological parameters including total non-paraprotein immunoglobulins and specific antibody titres were measured in all patients and compared with a control population of healthy individuals of a similar age; response to immunisation with Pneumovax II, tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> <b>toxoids</b> and IgG subclasses were measured in a subgroup of 41 patients. Other characteristics investigated for any association with infection included age, sex, paraprotein type, disease stage, and chemotherapy. RESULTS [...] Specific antibody titres to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides and tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> <b>toxoids</b> were significantly reduced compared with the control population. Low antipneumococcal and anti Escherichia coli titres correlated with risk of serious infection and low anti-pneumococcal titres with severity of non-paraprotein immunosuppression. In 41 immunised patients responses to Pneumovax II, tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> <b>toxoids</b> were poor; IgG subclass levels were significantly reduced and a poor IgG response to Pneumovax II immunisation was {{associated with an increased}} risk of septicaemia and low IgG 2 levels. The overall serious infection rate was 0. 92 infections per patient year and was four times higher during periods of active disease (1. 90) compared with plateau phase myeloma (0. 49). The predominant site of infection was the respiratory tract. Clinical and laboratory parameters showed only male sex and reduced non-paraprotein IgG and IgA levels to be significantly associated with at least one serious infection. CONCLUSIONS [...] A subgroup {{of patients with}} myeloma with poor IgG responses to exogenous antigens, who are at increased risk of serious infection, can be identified and may benefit from replacement immunoglobulin therapy {{to reduce the risk of}} infection...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for a large efficacy trial in Germany, a pilot study was initiated in December 1990. In this study 149 infants were enrolled; with double-blind randomization 75 received Lederle/Takeda acellular pertussis component diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (APDT) and 74 received Lederle whole-cell pertussis component diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP). The mean age at first dose was 3. 5 months, and {{the second and third}} doses followed at 6 -week intervals. Reactions were relatively mild with both vaccines; in general they were less frequent following APDT. The IgG antibody responses to lymphocytosis promoting factor (LPF) and fimbriae- 2 were similar in both groups whereas the responses to pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) were greater in APDT recipients. DTP recipients had greater responses to tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> <b>toxoids.</b> When age of first dose was examined (8 - 12 weeks versus 16 - 20 weeks), it was found that young age had a suppressive effect on antibody responses in DTP but not APDT recipients to LPF toxoid, pertactin, fimbriae- 2, and tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> <b>toxoids.</b> High values of transplacentally acquired antibody lessened the response to LPF toxoid and tetanus toxoid in DTP recipients and to tetanus toxoid in APDT vaccinees. The IgG immune response to LPF toxoid, FHA and fimbriae- 2 was found to be more uniform in APDT recipients than in DTP vaccinees. An IgA antibody response to fimbriae- 2 was noted in 13 % of DTP recipients but in no APDT vaccinees.

Using a murine model, {{we investigated}} whether vaccination with diphtheria/ tetanus toxoids, administered separately or simultaneously {{with the whole}} cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis, inhibits subsequent allergen-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Methods: BALB/c-mice were vaccinated intracutaneously {{with a combination of}} <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> or a combination of <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> with a whole cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis (three times, days - 21 to - 7) prior to systemic sensitization (days 1 - 14) and repeated airway challenges (days 28 - 30) with ovalbumin. Results: Compared to negative controls, systemic sensitization and airway allergen challenges induced high serum levels of allergen-specific IgE, predominant Th 2 -type cytokine production, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity. Vaccination with <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus <b>toxoids</b> prior to sensitization suppressed IgE formation and development of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Co-vaccination with a whole cell pertussis vaccine inhibited allergen sensitization, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity.
