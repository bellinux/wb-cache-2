They will take with them eight men-at-arms, all of whom will be stout fellows; so that, with your own men, you can traverse the country without fear of any party you are likely to fall in with." ...|$|R

5000|$|Steve Lumbley, {{who worked}} for Tilton's {{ministry}} in 1991 when the original Primetime Live investigation took place, told {{a reporter for the}} Dallas Observer in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the 1991 Primetime Live exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog [...] "Unfair Park", Lumbley asserted that [...] "the mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> that was not a normal practice." [...] However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that [...] "God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down." ...|$|E

The warfare is of a kind very different to that to which you are accustomed, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> that <b>you</b> shall see that we Poles, undisciplined, badly armed, and fighting a hopeless battle, can yet die as bravely as your own trained soldiers in the Crimea. We are now {{going back to the}} place we left the day before yesterday, and which we regard as our headquarters. We had news that the column we attacked was to set out, and as so far none of our bands had visited this neighborhood, we thought we might take them by surprise. We succeeded in doing them much damage, but our success was not as great as that which we gained in our last fight, when we succeeded in capturing two cannons.

5000|$|Ice Prince first {{announced}} {{the title and}} release timeframe of his second studio album during an interview with Toolz on NdaniTV's The Juice. He said: [...] "I'm working on an album for 2013. I can't announce the date yet but {{later on in the}} year, there will be an album called the Fire of Zamani. One of the stories I'm trying to tell is that criticism brings out the beast and fire in you. Often being criticized from my first album, I'm working on the next album like I've never worked on anything in my life before. It's going to be awesome, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> that. It's going to be great." [...] Furthermore, he said he heard the phrase Fire of Zamani while listening to 2face's The Unstoppable album. Fire of Zamani was initially scheduled for release on September 9, 2013, in order to commemorate the victims of a 2001 Jos crisis.|$|E

For a sliver, for a millisecond, I respected Edge for being a very smart WWE Champion because not everybody kicks down {{the door of the}} saloon and wants to challenge everybody to a gunfight. I respect somebody who picks their spots, but after what happened this week...f*** him.I’ll tell you, that sumbitch’s plan really backfired on the psychological warfare, because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> my dad and my brothers are going to be front row center looking on SummerSlam.

5000|$|Regarding {{the process}} of turning Rachel into a playable {{character}} for Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Hayashi (who directed the game), stated: [...] "As you know our goal with Ryu Hayabusa {{is to make the}} coolest action game character. So what we're saying now is that if Hayabusa is the coolest male action-game character, and the best-controlling, fastest action-game character, then let's make Rachel the best female action-game character. As you know, there are other action games coming out for PS3 with female lead characters, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> that Rachel is going to kick their asses. We've tweaked everything so that she plays differently than Hayabusa, but is still fast and controllable and feels -- I don't have a better way to put it -- female. She her actions aren't as calculated and aren't as efficient as Hayabusa's. She has a certain elegance to her that's explicitly female, and so just going in there and playing with her and seeing how she controls, it's obvious that we're going to have a really great character on our hands." [...] A female motion capture actor was employed to create the character's movement. Sigma 2 animation director Sosuke Wakamatsu said they wanted Rachel to be [...] "sexy and powerful".|$|E

Following the 10 October 2010 mass rioting by the right-wing groups in protest of the Belgrade gay pride parade, {{standing in front of}} the Democratic Party headquarters that were attacked by the rioters, Homen went on state-television airwaves, delivering a threatening message to the [...] "hooligans".

It simply seems to me they are more prone to skidding, but this is perhaps because their tyres have no tread and that the bicycle is very short. That universal agreement has fixed on 70cm as the proper size for wheels does not in any way prove that this diameter is best; it simply proves that cyclists follow each other like sheep.|$|R

I truly believe that if someone wants to spend his professional life with music, he will - either as a soloist, orchestra member, teacher, concert promoter, or agent - in the end it is unimportant. One should choose to become a musician because one believes that the world needs music and without music, the emotional life of human beings is going to die.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007 season, it was rumored that there was a rift between Washington and Rangers star Mark Teixeira. Asked about it, Washington responded, A lot of times we make three outs on four or five pitches... I just can't see that late in the game when you're four or five runs down. You're {{at the point where the}} starter is out of the game, you're in the middle (of the bullpen), these are the guys you want to get to. I've never asked him (Teixeira) to do it when the closer is in the game. But the middle guys, you want to make 'em throw... He feels like he's going to only get one pitch in that type of situation to do something with. He wants to take advantage of it. I've got no problem with that. But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>guarantee</b> with that one pitch that you're going to do something with it? I don't think any ballplayer on earth <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> that. <b>You</b> might pop it up, miss it, roll over it, jam yourself. Then you make one out on one pitch. I want to see him get a pitchers' strike right there.|$|R
