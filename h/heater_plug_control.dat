5000|$|Victor {{extended}} their {{range of a}} 25 cwt and a 2-ton vehicle {{by the addition of}} a 12 cwt model in 1936. All of their vehicles were designed to have a top speed of 20 mph. The electric motor was mounted just behind the front wheels, and drove the rear wheels through a propellor shaft and bevel rear axle. The front wheels were fitted with independent suspension, to reduce pitching, and the buyer could specify whether they wanted steering to be by a tiller or a wheel. [...] In 1945 Victor announced that it had developed a battery-electric vehicle which did not need a separate charger, but could be plugged into any standard <b>heater</b> <b>plug.</b> This principle had been tried to good effect in Europe. Other innovations included the concept of a standard battery, which could be fitted to eight different vehicles with payloads ranging from 10 cwt to 80 cwt. A single battery would be fitted to the smallest vehicle, and four to the largest. They also announced a scheme by which batteries could be hired, rather than bought outright.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. <b>Heater</b> <b>plugs</b> were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|R
40|$|In situ {{chemical}} oxidation or ISCO schemes {{involve the}} addition of a chemical oxidant, such as potassium permanganate (KMnO 4), which destroys chlorinated solvents like TCE in a straightforward reaction. Although ISCO is now regarded as a developing technology in an industrial sense, beyond active flushing schemes, there have been relatively limited investigations in how ISCO might be better used. Our previous study showed that KMnO 4 flushing approaches often would be frustrated by the inability to control the delivery of the treatment fluid due to precipitation of low-permeability reaction by-product like MnO 2 and other problems. It was therefore suggested that development of a new ISCO scheme that can provide both destruction efficiencies and <b>plugging</b> <b>control</b> would be required...|$|R

50|$|With solid plugs, a tube or area exists {{above and}} below the bevel and turning the <b>plug</b> <b>controls</b> access. In a number of cases it is {{convenient}} to fully remove a plug which can give access to the region beyond the bevel. Plugs are generally made of an inert plastic such as PTFE and are attached to a threaded sleeve {{in such a way that}} the sleeve can be turned without spinning the plug. The contact with the bevel is made by an O-ring fitted to the tip of the plug or by the plug itself. There are a few examples where the plug in made of glass. In the case of glass plugs, the joint contact is always a rubber O-ring but they are still prone to shattering.|$|R

The first objective is to use laboratory experiments and computer simulations {{to develop a new}} semi-passive delivery system for the controlled release of KMnO 4. A system is required to facilitate the slow release of KMnO 4 into flowing ground water in a manner that maximizes the lateral spreading, and minimizes the number of wells.

40|$|Sulfuric acid {{is present}} in most coal flue gases because a {{percentage}} of the SO 2 produced (typically 0. 5 to 1. 5 %) is further oxidized in the boiler to SO 3, which combines with flue gas moisture to form vapor-phase or condensed sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid in the flue gas can potentially lead to air <b>heater</b> corrosion, <b>plugging</b> and fouling; duct corrosion; and a visible plume. These effects are exacerbated if selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is retrofitted for NOX control, as SCR catalysts further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO 2 to SO 3.

40|$|A novel sample {{injection}} method for chip CE was presented. This injection method uses hydrostatic pressure, generated by emptying the sample waste reservoir, for sample loading and electrokinetic force for dispensing. The injection {{was performed on}} a double-cross microchip. One cross, created by the sample and separation channels, is used for formation of a sample plug. Another cross, formed by the sample and controlling channels, is used for <b>plug</b> <b>control.</b> By varying the electric field in the controlling channel, the sample plug volume can be linearly adjusted.

The potential of this injection method was demonstrated by a four-separation-channel chip CE system. In this system, parallel sample separation can be achieved with only two electrodes, which is otherwise impossible with conventional injection methods.

All patients (n[*]=[*] 12) had been fitted with a bone conduction device (BCD) to restore bilateral hearing. The patients were tested in the unaided (monaural) and aided (binaural) hearing condition. Five listeners without hearing loss were tested as a control group while listening with a monaural plug and earmuff, or with both ears (binaural). We randomly varied stimulus presentation levels to assess whether listeners relied on the acoustic head-shadow effect (HSE) for horizontal (azimuth) localization. Moreover, to prevent sound localization {{on the basis of}} monaural spectral shape cues from head and pinna, subjects were exposed to narrow band (1 / 3 octave) noises. We demonstrate that the BCD significantly improved sound localization in 8 / 12 of the UCHL patients. Interestingly, under monaural hearing (BCD off), we observed fairly good unaided azimuth localization performance in 4 / 12 of the patients. Our multiple regression analysis shows that all patients relied on the ambiguous HSE for localization. In contrast, acutely <b>plugged</b> <b>control</b> listeners did not employ the HSE.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project has been to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The project was co-funded by the U. S. DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40718, along with EPRI, the American Electric Power Company (AEP), FirstEnergy Corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Carmeuse North America. Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increased interest for coal-fired power generating units for a number of reasons. In particular, sulfuric acid can cause plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOX control, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project tested the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different magnesium-based or dolomitic alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents were tested during one- to two-week tests conducted on two FirstEnergy Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP) units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry byproduct from a modified Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime wet flue gas desulfurization process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercially available magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners. The other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles inserted through the front wall of the upper furnace. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests on two different units. The longer-term tests were conducted to confirm sorbent effectiveness over extended operation on two different boilers, and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. The first long-term test was conducted on FirstEnergy's BMP Unit 3, and the second was conducted on AEP's Gavin Plant, Unit 1. The Gavin Plant test provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. A final task in the project was to compare projected costs for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries to estimated costs for other potential sulfuric acid control technologies.

The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercial magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners, while the other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles into the front wall of upper furnace, either across from the nose of the furnace or across from the pendant superheater tubes. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests. The longer-term tests are being conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the sorbents tested over extended operation and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. This reports presents the results of the short-term tests; the long-term test results will be reported in a later document. The short-term test results showed that three of the four reagents tested, dolomite powder, commercial magnesium hydroxide slurry, and byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry, were able to achieve 90 % or greater removal of sulfuric acid compared to baseline levels. The molar ratio of alkali to flue gas sulfuric acid content (under baseline conditions) required to achieve 90 % sulfuric acid removal was lowest for the byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry.
