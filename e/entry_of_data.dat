50|$|Electronic diaries {{automatically}} time-stamp all entries, {{and can be}} set up to only allow entry within specified time-windows. This improves compliance, and {{ensures that}} true compliance can be documented. Documenting compliance is important if ePRO data are to be used to support regulatory applications. ePRO applications typically achieve compliance rates of over 80%, often over 90%. Electronic diaries also have benefits in that they only allow valid, in-range entries to be made. Devices such as PDAs allow reminders to be given to patients when entries are due. Systems generally transfer data promptly to a central server, allowing tailored feedback to be given to patients. This can also improve compliance. Electronic diaries also eliminate the need for manual editing and <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> time-consuming and error-prone processes.|$|E

5000|$|One of ResEdit's most {{powerful}} features (which first appeared with ResEdit version 2.0) {{is the ability}} to define arbitrary data structures as resources using a simple template building feature. Here, the programmer can simply add elemental data types to a list to define a template (itself stored as a resource of type [...] ). This template allows ResEdit to build a GUI editor on the fly that allows <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and package it into the structure defined in the template. It's a simple matter for a programmer to define a matching data structure in a chosen programming language, such as C, load the resource in a standard manner and access the data as the defined C type. ResEdit includes a number of predefined templates for many standard OS resources that do not require a graphical editor.|$|E

50|$|The load phase loads {{the data}} {{into the end}} target, which may be a simple delimited flat file or a data warehouse. Depending on the {{requirements}} of the organization, this process varies widely. Some data warehouses may overwrite existing information with cumulative information; updating extracted data is frequently done on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Other data warehouses (or even other parts of the same data warehouse) may add new data in a historical form at regular intervals—for example, hourly. To understand this, consider a data warehouse that is required to maintain sales records of the last year. This data warehouse overwrites any data older than a year with newer data. However, the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> for any one year window is made in a historical manner. The timing and scope to replace or append are strategic design choices dependent on the time available and the business needs. More complex systems can maintain a history and audit trail of all changes to the data loaded in the data warehouse.|$|E

40|$|Method {{and system}} for {{recognizing}} and characterizing bioelectric potential or electromyographic (EMG) signals associated {{with at least}} one of a coarse gesture and a fine gesture that is performed by a person, and use of the bioelectric potentials to enter data and/or commands into an electrical and/or mechanical instrument. As a gesture is performed, bioelectric signals that accompany the gesture are subjected to statistical averaging, within selected time intervals. Hidden Markov model analysis is applied to identify hidden, gesture-related states that are present. A metric is used to compare signals produced by a volitional gesture (not yet identified) with corresponding signals associated with each of a set of reference gestures, and the reference gesture that is closest to the volitional gesture is identified. Signals representing the volitional gesture are analyzed and compared with a database of reference gestures to determine if the volitional gesture is likely {{to be one of the}} reference gestures. Electronic and/or mechanical commands needed to carry out the gesture may be implemented at an interface to control an instrument. Applications include control of an aircraft, <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from a keyboard or other data entry device, and <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and commands in extreme environments that interfere with accurate entry...|$|E
40|$|Data {{alignment}} and computation domain partitioning {{techniques have}} been widely investigated to reduce communication overheads in distributed memory systems. This paper considers how these two techniques can be combined and applied to af"ne nested loops. Current data alignment techniques focus on individual <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> arrays and, in general, cannot be used directly for cases when blocks <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> should be aligned collectively. This paper shows that existing data alignment techniques {{can be applied to}} partitioned algorithms if the null space <b>of</b> the <b>data</b> array indexing matrix is a boundary of computation blocks or the intersection of some computation block boundaries. These conditions can be used to generate several different partitionings and timespace transformations for a given target architecture. An example illustrates how it is possible to trade-off the number of communications and the memory space. Another example shows partitions of matrixmatrix multiplication that have smaller communicationcomputation ratios than Cannon's algorithm...|$|R
