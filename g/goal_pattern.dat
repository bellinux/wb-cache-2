40|$|As a {{metabolic}} network reaches from a {{state to}} a steady state, a subset of its fluxes gradually change. The sequence of intermediate states, called the dynamic state, shows the pattern that the underlying network follows to reach the steady state Understanding this pattern is crucial for metabolic engineering as the intermediate states can lead to undesired effects such as toxicity although the final steady state is a desired one. In this paper, we consider the problem of enzymatic target identification in metabolic networks. Unlike existing strategies, we consider the dynamic behavior of the state changes of the networks. Given a <b>goal</b> <b>pattern</b> for the fluxes of a given network, we aim to find the set of enzyme knockouts that will produce a dynamic state similar to that <b>goal</b> <b>pattern.</b> We consider three distance functions to measure the difference between two dynamic states. These are the Euclidean distance, timewarping distance and pattern distance. Euclidean distance restricts the solution space to the exact goal state. Time-warping distance allows for stretching of the <b>goal</b> <b>pattern</b> in the time domain. Pattern distance allows scaling and shifting of the goal flux in addition to stretching in the time domain. We provide a branch and bound method to solve this problem. We also develop a partitioning strategy to reduce the running time of our method. This strategy avoids constructing the entire dynamic state by computing a lower bound to the distance between two dynamic states when the entire dynamic state is not available. Our experiments on the purine metabolism show that our method runs accurately. They also show that our partitioning strategy reduces the number of time intervals computed for dynamic states {{by a factor of}} 2 to 6. 1...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an optical system {{for creating a}} potential field map of a bounded two dimensional region containing a goal location and an arbitrary number of obstacles. The potential field mapping system has an imaging device and a processor. Two image writing modes are used by the imaging device, electron deposition and electron depletion. Patterns written in electron deposition mode appear black and expand. Patterns written in electron depletion mode are sharp and appear white. The generated image represents a robot's workspace. The imaging device under processor control then writes a goal location in the work-space using the electron deposition mode. The black image of the goal expands in the workspace. The processor stores the generated images, and uses them to generate a feedback pattern. The feedback pattern is written in the workspace by the imaging device in the electron deposition mode to enhance {{the expansion of the}} original <b>goal</b> <b>pattern.</b> After the feedback pattern is written, an obstacle pattern is written by the imaging device in the electron depletion mode to represent the obstacles in the robot's workspace. The processor compares a stored image to a previously stored image to determine a change therebetween. When no change occurs, the processor averages the stored images to produce the potential field map...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) are characterized with persistent fatigue which disturbs activities of daily life. The most promising treatment results in CFS are found with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET). Both treatment strategies underline the importance of regular physical activity. However, still {{a significant number of}} CFS patients do not encounter a reduction of CFS complaints after CBT and GET. The goal of this thesis is to study whether ambulant monitoring of and providing direct feedback on daily physical activities can improve the balance in the daily physical activity pattern and result in improved treatment outcome in patients with CFS. To achieve this goal the daily physical activity pattern is studied in patients with CFS. Subsequently, a ‘state of the art’ feedback system is used to investigate the potential value of ambulant feedback at the daily physical activity pattern in the treatment of CFS. A systematic review (chapter 2) has shown that patients with CFS are less physically active compared to asymptomatic controls. In a subsequent study (chapter 3) it is found that CFS patients have equal physical activity levels in the morning, but decreased levels in afternoon and evening. Ambulant feedback at daily physical activity patterns has shown promising results (chapter 4). Patients with CFS were able to change their daily physical activity pattern into the direction of the goal. Compliance with the feedback system was low and maybe related to the instantaneous effect of the feedback. In a randomized controlled trial no additional value in treatment outcome was found for the ambulant feedback program as supplement to an inpatient rehabilitation program comprising CBT and GET (chapter 5). A second randomized controlled trial has indicated favourable outcome with a more personalized <b>goal</b> <b>pattern</b> in balancing daily physical activity patterns (chapter 6). Ambulant feedback in the home environment of the CFS patient showed promising results in changing the physical activity pattern. It is expected that adequate adaptations in, and implementation of, the ambulant feedback program can contribute to improvements in the treatment of CFS...|$|E

A self-report survey measuring achievement goals, academic self-regulation, academic self-efficacy and affective distress was completed. Analyses of variance, cluster analysis and post-hoc comparisons were used to examine group differences. Gender differences in motivational <b>goal</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified, particularly with respect to the performance-approach goal. The dual task/performance-approach goal orientation reflected overall the most productive pattern of achievement motivation, and this was superior to the single task-mastery goal cluster. The performance-avoidance goal orientation exerted a strong negative effect, regardless of its combination with task or performance-approach goals. The traditionally held view that the single, task-mastery goal orientation is the most productive approach was not supported...|$|R

We carry out an extensive analysis of the combinatorial optimization problem, and propose multiple algorithmic solutions, offering different quality-complexity trade-offs.

With the more stringent European Union regulation of nutrition and health claims, insights into consumers' health-related <b>goal</b> <b>patterns</b> and their reactions towards such claims are needed to influence the content of lawful claims. This study investigated how consumers' explicit and implicit health-related motive orientations (HRMOs) together {{with the type of}} calcium-claim (nutrition claim, health claim and reduction of disease risk claim) influence perceived credibility and purchasing intention of calcium-enriched fruit juice. Data were collected in April 2006 through a consumer survey with 341 Belgian adults. The findings indicate that stronger implicit HRMOs (i. e., indirect benefits of calcium for personal health) are associated with higher perceived credibility, which is not (yet) translated into a higher purchasing intention. Consumers' explicit HRMOs, which refer to direct benefits or physiological functions of calcium in the body-as legally permitted in current calcium-claims in the EU-do not associate with reactions to the claims. Independently of consumers' HRMOs, the claim type significantly affects the perceived credibility and purchasing intention of the product.

Previous cross-sectional research on patients with chronic disease related higher levels of goal management strategies to lower levels of distress {{and higher levels of}} well-being. This study was the first to focus longitudinally on <b>goal</b> management <b>patterns</b> that combined strategies originating from different goal management theories. Our first study objective was to identify patterns that consisted of various strategies of goal management among patients with polyarthritis. Subsequently, the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between these patterns and the psychological health of the patients were studied. Methods A longitudinal questionnaire study with three measurements of goal management and psychological health was conducted among 331 patients with polyarthritis. Stability of goal management over time was analysed with ANOVAs. Patterns were identified using cluster analysis at baseline, based on the following strategies: Goal maintenance, goal adjustment, goal disengagement, and goal reengagement. Longitudinal relationships between the patterns and psychological health (specifically: Depression, anxiety, purpose in life, positive affect, and social participation) were analysed using a generalized estimating equations analysis. Results Three <b>goal</b> management <b>patterns</b> were found: ‘Moderate engagement’, ‘Broad goal management repertoire’, and ‘Holding on’. Patients with the ‘Broad <b>goal</b> management repertoire’ <b>pattern</b> had the highest level of psychological health.

This study examined a conditional process model with team sport athletes’ approach-avoidance achievement goals as mediators between their implicit beliefs of sport ability and sport-related cognitive anxiety. We expected gender to moderate the paths from implicit beliefs of ability to approachavoidance goals and from approach-avoidance goals to cognitive anxiety. Team sport athletes {{with a mean age}} of 20 years (163 females and 152 males) responded to questionnaires about their implicit beliefs of sport ability, approach-avoidance goals and sport-related cognitive anxiety. Incremental beliefs, gender and the interaction between them predicted masteryapproach goals. Gender also predicted mastery-avoidance goals, with females reporting higher levels than males. Masteryavoidance goals, gender and the interaction between them predicted cognitive anxiety, with females reporting higher levels of anxiety than males. Entity beliefs positively predicted performance-avoidance goals and the interaction between performance-approach and gender predicted anxiety.
