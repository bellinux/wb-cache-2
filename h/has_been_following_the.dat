In Indonesia, some news bulletins are in Mandarin, whilst in Singapore, {{one of the four}} official languages is Mandarin. In the Philippines, Filipino-Chinese movies have won top prizes and 'chinovelas' are displayed on local television stations, with Hokkien being widely spoken by the local Chinese community. Vietnam <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> 'China model' politically and economically; like in China, Vietnamese from overseas have led and been the most significant contributors of the economic recovery of the country. Malaysia experiences Chinese cultural influence through Chinese tycoons; they play a prominent role in leading the economic boom and inspire reforms to Malaysia’s bumiputera policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{river is}} now wider {{and starts to}} form meanders. It passes more lakes at South Acre Hall, a large {{farmhouse}} parts of which date from the sixteenth century, and then crosses Castle Acre Common, {{and there are several}} lakes in Big Wood. A mill was located {{at the end of the}} wood. The main channel and the mill bypass both cross a minor road at fords. At West Acre the river passes the remains of an Augustinian priory and then Narford Lake, by Narford Hall. The remains of the priory are grade II listed and a scheduled ancient monument. The Hall is grade I listed, and was built between 1690 and 1704 by Andrew Fountaine of Salle in Norfolk. It was enlarged in the 1830s. The river passes to the north of Narborough, where there are lakes and a fish farm. The A47 Narborough Bypass crosses, as does the original main road to Narborough, beside which is a former water mill, built in the eighteenth century and repaired in the late twentieth, which still contains much of the milling machinery. The Lynn and Dereham Railway line used to cross to the west of Narborough, but it is now dismantled. The Nar Valley Way, a long-distance footpath which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> valley for most of the length of the river now runs along the river bank. Numerous drainage ditches are associated with the next stretch of the river, and after passing Abbey Farm, where there are the remains of another Augustinian Priory, the river is embanked, with flood banks on both sides. The Nar Valley Way crosses from the south bank to the north at the start of the embanking.|$|E

2500|$|Poindexter and Rice {{had been}} {{members of the}} Black Panther Party, and their case was, and {{continues}} to be, [...] controversial. The Omaha Police recommended withholding exculpatory evidence, a tape of a 911 call, from being played at the trial.

2500|$|The modern {{hand-held}} protractor compass {{always has}} an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator {{inscribed on the}} baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or {{to ensure that the}} object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using [...] "true" [...] or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the magnetic bearing into a true bearing. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.|$|E
