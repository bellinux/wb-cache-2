500|$|The {{influence}} of Paris permeates La Comédie: nature defers to the artificial metropolis, {{in contrast to}} descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the countryside. [...] "If in Paris", Rogers says, [...] "we are in a man-made region where even the seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting". Balzac said, [...] "the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds." [...] His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. The centrality of Paris in La Comédie Humaine is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. [...] "Realism <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not urban", notes critic Peter Brooks; {{the scene of a}} young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as Illusions Perdues.|$|E
500|$|The song {{also appears}} on the soundtrack of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge! and is sung by the {{characters}} Harold Zidler, played by Jim Broadbent, and The Duke of Monroth, played by Richard Roxburgh. In 2004, The Meat Purveyors covered the song in a bluegrass medley, pairing it with Madonna's [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Burning Up." [...] In the 2004 film , the title character teaches the song to women in a Thai prison, after becoming annoyed that they are singing the song badly. She tells them, [...] "Madonna <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not a perfectionist!" [...] In one of the episodes of the TV show Grey's Anatomy, the character of Cristina Yang hums the song during surgery to take the focus off herself. However, when her assisting surgery, Lexie Grey starts singing along, Christina looks venomously at her until she quiets down. Katy Perry, Travis Barker and DJ AM covered the song at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, the song was namechecked in the Train hit single [...] "Hey, Soul Sister" [...] with the lyric [...] "I believe in you/Like a virgin you're Madonna/And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind".|$|E
500|$|According to The Kansas City Star Smith, [...] "Frank hasn’t changed, {{and neither}} has his brand of Machiavellian {{political}} theater" [...] and [...] "Spacey has lost {{none of his}} smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain". According to Variety Brian Lowry, [...] "Kevin Spacey’s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician" [...] is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the [...] "failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Goodman says [...] "Spacey <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not constantly magnetic". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that [...] "Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and {{reminds us of the}} fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there". [...] However Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2 noting that the season was [...] "...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before." ...|$|E

500|$|Under the Jennisons, {{the main}} {{priorities}} for Belle Vue were the zoological and botanical gardens; amusements were provided {{merely as a}} distraction. The Jennisons laid out formal gardens in various styles between 1836 and 1898, including mazes, grottoes, an Italian garden, [...] "billiard-table lawns" [...] and constructed Tropical Plant Houses. There were also exotic constructions like the Indian temple and grotto, designed by George Danson, Belle Vue's scenic artist. Built to resemble a ruined temple, it housed snakes and crocodiles as well as flowers. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, [...] "the resort relied almost entirely for its attraction on its delightful gardens", but by 1931 the formalism had entirely disappeared. The gardens were also used to stage large political rallies for a wide spectrum of opinion, such as the Great Liberal Demonstration of 1924, at which Lloyd George addressed a crowd of 50,000, the first political meeting at which loudspeakers were used. The British Union of Fascists, popularly known as the Blackshirts, also held a meeting there, in September 1934. One contemporary commentator observed that [...] "perhaps the Ku Klux Klan will be found in session there one day, for Belle Vue <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Kofi Outlaw, Editor-in-Chief at Screenrant.com, gave Man of Steel a 4 out of 5 star review, {{stating that}} [...] "Man of Steel {{has more than}} earned its keep, and deserves to be THE iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation". He {{would go on to}} name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action {{sequences}} and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III, wrote, [...] "The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of [...] "The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time" [...] as voted by the magazine's readers.|$|E
2500|$|... "Like {{so many of}} his films, Underworld and Scarface are 'stories' that ace-reporter Hecht {{loved to}} cover, as much for the larger-than-life qualities of his headliners as for the enormity of their crimes. Love-hate ... fascination-revulsion ... exposé-glorification ... these are the {{polarities}} that make Hecht's best films deliciously ambiguous." [...] "Hecht's introduction, which <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not moody and Sandburgian, describes 'A great city {{in the dead of night}} - streets lonely, moon-flooded - buildings empty as the cliff-dwellings of a forgotten age." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{just prior}} to {{beginning}} his ministry, M.C. Hammer (who by that time had re-adopted [...] "M.C.") {{was the subject of}} an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show and the VH1 series Behind the Music (music from his album Inside Out V was featured in this documentary). In these appearances, Burrell admitted [...] "that [...] had already used up most of [...] fortune of over $20 million, proving that money <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> it doesn't bring peace and if priorities are wrong". He would go on to express a similar point in other interviews as well.|$|E
2500|$|While Human became Norwood's first {{effort not to}} be {{nominated}} for a Grammy Award in any category, it received generally favorable reviews from music critics, averaging a 67 out of a 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented the album as appropriately rich and varied: [...] "It's better than good enough. It's a light, breezy listen that shows off Brandy's resilience, humility, joy, and vibrancy." [...] She especially highlighted Jerkins' input on the album: [...] "Jerkins manages {{to bring out the}} expressive best in her pleasantly raspy vocalizing." [...] The Guardian writer Alex Macpherson noted Human [...] "a thoughtful, intimate work on which Norwood sings movingly about fragility and fear," [...] giving it four and a half stars out of five, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the album Norwood's [...] "most platitudinal" [...] and [...] "least enjoyable release in her catalog," [...] adding: [...] "Brandy is clearly in a comfort zone that enables her to open up more than ever [...] Human <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> not a serious album. But it could very well be her most useful one." [...] He gave the album three and half stars out of five. Billboard magazine said that [...] "while Human is missing the sassy Brandy we know and love from such tracks like 'I Wanna Be Down' and 'Talk About Our Love,' we can still appreciate the much-needed solace of setting personal turmoil to memorable music." ...|$|E
