Behaviour-based energy interventions aim to impact demand through influencing some aspect of <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> - what people have, think, and/or do.

40|$|As part of {{mitigating}} climate change, {{the last}} decades have seen an increasing focus on energy efficiency and reducing energy use within all areas of society, including the residential sector. However, reducing energy use in households {{has proven to be}} very complex. In Norway, energy use in households has surprisingly leveled off, but not declined, since the mid- 1990 s. Though, this has occured at a relatively high level compared to other countries, and has come as a result of unexpected and potentially temporary developments that were hardly the result of a coordinated effort to reduce energy use, so action is still required. For this reason, this thesis attempts to push the field of Industrial Ecology beyond its traditional techno-economic solutions to theoretical developments in the social sciences related to energy use, in particular those around the concept of <b>energy</b> <b>culture.</b> Research on energy use has traditionally focused on technological and economic solutions, and with an understanding of consumers as purely rational beings whereby energy efficiency would hold the answer. However, as this thesis shows, reducing energy use in households requires looking to the social and cultural context within which consumers live, as well as psychological constructs such as habits and social norms. The empirical evidence of this thesis is taken from eight focus group interviews done as part of a project between Enova and the project leader Professor Christian Kl&# 246;ckner from NTNU. Through a qualitative thematic data analysis, six themes were discovered that characterize Norwegian <b>energy</b> <b>culture.</b> One could particularly describe the current <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> in Norway as revolving around notions of comfort, convenience and coziness. What people consider part of the good life is naturally connected to a very energy-intensive lifestyle. Using theories from social science literature, this work explains ways in which energy use can be understood as a relationship between culture, policy, regulation, technology, groups, individuals, social practices, social norms and habits. The development of an original <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> model is also explained and used to explore <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> as well as interventions to reduce energy use. The model emphasizes the multidimensionality of <b>energy</b> <b>culture,</b> and thus highlights the need for multidimensional solutions. For example, reducing energy use is not just about more information, the right incentives or saving money, since social practices and cultural aspects act as barriers. Policymakers should keep in mind that designing effective intervention strategies is complicated, especially as policies can lead to unexpected effects. One should also analyze how energy is culturally interpreted when introducing new technologies and policies, as it can be problematic to introduce general energy policies in atypical cultures such as Norway, where electricity is such a significant energy carrier. The main conclusion {{is that there is no}} silver bullet for desiging an intervention strategy for any culture, but that cooperation between various disciplines such as sociology, psychology as well as conventional techno-economic perspectives is needed, since <b>energy</b> <b>culture,</b> and thus energy use, happens on a multidimensional level. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{empirical}} material gathered {{with young}} adults in New Zealand {{to examine a}} potential sustainability transition-in-practice. It draws from two frameworks; the actorcentred <b>Energy</b> <b>Cultures</b> Framework to explore mobility behaviours, and the multi-level perspective (MLP) to situate behaviour change within the socio-technical transitions literature. The MLP has traditionally been used to analyse historical transitions (e. g. from the horse and cart to the motor vehicle), but in this paper, {{it is used to}} explore an on-going change trend; the emergent mobilities of young adults who appear to be aspiring for different types of mobility. A series of mobility trends are described, which emerged from a programme of qualitative interviews (n= 51). The material culture, norms and practices that constitute these trends are articulated. These are then considered through the lens of the MLP. The evidence points to emergent trends of multimodality that, if leveraged upon and supported, could contribute to a systemic sustainability transition...|$|R

Semi-structured interviews conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand, with 51 drivers and non-drivers, aged 18 - 35 years old, form the empirical material. The findings build upon previous research and extend understandings of how seven explanatory factors; perceptual, value and preference, social, built environment, economic, legal/ policy and technological, work both to continue the current automobility paradigm, and to challenge it by adopting alternative mobilities. We use the <b>Energy</b> <b>Cultures</b> Framework as an analytical tool to explore the ways through which material factors, norms, practices, and external context can replicate or reduce participation in the hegemonic mobility paradigm. This approach offers useful insights into the interactions between what the research participants think, have and do, and how this is resulting in a reduction in automobility norms amongst some younger people. It also identifies and highlights potential opportunities to leverage upon current change trends to assist a systemic transition away from automobility towards a culture of multi-mobilities...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{cultures}} framework {{was developed}} in 2009 to support interdisciplinary investigation into energy behaviour in New Zealand. In this paper, we discuss the framework in light of 5 years of empirical application and conceptual development. The concept of culture is helpful in seeking to better understand energy behaviour because it conveys how behaviours are embedded within the physical and social contexts of everyday life, {{and how they are}} both repetitive and heterogeneous. The framework suggests that the <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> of a given subject (e. g. an individual, a household, a business, a sector) can be studied by examining the interrelationships between their norms, practices and material culture, and how these, in turn, are shaped by external influences. We discuss the key theoretical influences of the framework, and how the core concepts of the framework have evolved as we have applied them in different research situations. We then illustrate how we have applied the framework to a range of topics and sectors, and how it has been used to support interdisciplinary research, in identifying clusters of energy cultures, in examining energy cultures at different scales and in different sectors, and to inform policy development...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares how {{analyses}} of energy use and efficiency have developed in households and industrial {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). I focus on earlier studies that use lifestyle categories in examining household energy use, comparing them with studies of mainly Swedish industrial SMEs using the barrier concept in understanding energy efficiency. The main {{question is how}} the use of lifestyle categories in household research can be adapted to industrial SMEs. The rationale for using doing this is to find a new way to approach industrial energy use that can give new insight or raise new questions. Lifestyle categories capture the <b>energy</b> <b>culture</b> of a company, including how energy is perceived and what habits and routines are like. Lifestyle categorisation complements barrier analysis, deepening our understanding of how and why companies improve energy efficiency. Using lifestyle categories in an analysis can help policy makers, who can then direct specific policies to particular segments of companies.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{there has been a}} {{substantial}} increase in the uptake of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems globally, which is starting to impact upon traditional electricity systems. An emerging energy transition is being driven by actions taken by actors at the grassroots level, and enabled by declining technology costs and new niche business models. However, to date, most work exploring change in energy systems has tended to focus on technological innovation and economic processes, leaving social aspects and daily activities under-addressed. Similarly, most theories that consider individual behaviour have tended to neglect the wider system of change. This paper presents an approach for simultaneously exploring behavioural and systemic change and demonstrates its use in a case study of PV uptake in New Zealand. The <b>Energy</b> <b>Cultures</b> framework is used alongside the Multi-Level Perspective of socio-technical transitions to examine the broad range of factors driving, shaping, and constraining PV uptake, and the interactions between global and national landscapes, the socio-technical regime within which users are taking action, and the niche opportunities emerging.
