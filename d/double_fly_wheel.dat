40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to design and}} to determine the inertial moment of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the allowed maximum and minimum angular velocity. The advantage of this method is: {{in the same time}} of the dynamic analysis of the the mechanics we can fulfill the design of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel.</b> With this method, the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> is determined precisely. In the traditional method, first we have to determine the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> then, make static-dynamic analysis of the mechanism and find out the react force of the connect pair. For example, after work, one first goes home and then has to go shopping. But if we choose not to go home directly, while on the way home in passing do some shopping then go home. Even though it is not the shortest way, but in total we can shave time and rod. It is the same occasion with our design method too. Even though the process of calculation is more complicated than the formal method, but we can determine the reaction on the connect pair at the same time. So that in total decreased the amount of design work. 1 Introductions Flywheel {{is an important part of}} shaper machine tool.

50|$|These {{systems are}} all remote {{controlled}} gyroscopic assisted stabilizing platforms. They utilize {{a series of}} spinning <b>fly</b> <b>wheels</b> and electronics to dampen the angular disturbances. They are mostly used for helicopter work but {{can also be used}} for camera car, crane, or suspended cable systems. The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the roll (dutch) axis, only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are closed architecture systems. The DP can only utilize the offered one or two cameras and lens combinations, normally a Mitchell R35 camera and a 10:1 zoom lens.|$|R

50|$|Since the 1970s, DC motors have {{declined}} in popularity; high end audiophile turntable designs use the synchronous motor, which are smoother running and lower noise. Due {{to the existence}} of instabilities of mains electricity, manufacturers might try to ensure pitch stability by generating its own sinusoidal waveform to power their AC motor. Other methods at achieving stability include using optical sensors on the platter which feed back to the electronics; or use of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> assemblies. Some manufacturers use mass to deal with the problem. Heavy platters, which have higher inertia, are thus less susceptible to minute speed variations. However, mass stores energy that may be difficult to control. Heavier platter also increases wear on the bearing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} design {{procedure of}} the magnetic bearings used for high-speed electric machines and <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> energy storage systems. Magnetic bearing can be categorized by inner-rotor type and outer-rotor type according {{to the position of}} the rotary disc. These two types are applicable based on application environments such as application space, required attraction force, and controllability. Magnetic bearing is generally designed based on the ratio(geometrical coefficient or geometrical efficiency) of pole width to rotor journal radius but proper ratio is only decided by the analysis. This is the difficulty {{of the magnetic}} bearing design. In this paper, proper design technology of the inner-rotor type and outer-rotor-type eight pole magnetic bearings is introduced and verified by finite element method on condition that applicable space is given...|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1568, a {{separate}} <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> powered a lathe via a drive belt. A master {{would cut the}} wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity. This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which {{made it possible to}} turn parts for other machinery. The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic slide rest. These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).|$|R
40|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) {{system uses}} {{end-to-end}} encryption {{in addition to}} the air interface encryption to provide enhanced security. End-to-end encrypted continuous data, such as video, requires synchronisation of the key stream at the receiver to the incoming encrypted data stream from the transmitter. The TETRA system uses a synchronisation technique known as frame stealing to provide synchronisation to end-to-end encrypted data. However, the frame stealing process degrades the quality of video and is not suitable for transmission of secure video. This paper proposes an alternative technique called frame insertion, which is more suitable for video. A technique known as <b>fly</b> <b>wheeling</b> is used to recover from synchronisation problems due to dropped data packets. Further, a method of reducing the synchronisation delay in a video stream is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Titanium matrix {{composites}} continuously {{reinforced by}} silicon carbide fibres are considered as key technology {{for a new}} generation of aero engines. High specific strength and stiffness promise significant weight savings and performance improvements. Impact loading may be one critical aspect in the design of rotating compressor components with titanium matrix composites. On the other hand the strength increases at high strain rates.
