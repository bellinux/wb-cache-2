The show {{consisted}} of a compilation of previous Late Night clips and included a surprise appearance by former sidekick Andy Richter. Will Ferrell, John Mayer, and the White Stripes also appeared. O'Brien ended the episode by destroying the set with an axe, handing out {{the pieces of the}} set to the audience, and thanking a list of people who helped him <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point in his career.

Clearly, what Peter did {{at the end of that}} episode is that he fundamentally changed the future. Our team is [...] on a separate path. It is unlikely that we’ll <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> specific outcome in 2026. But are events like what happened in Detroit inevitable in any version of the future? TBD." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the subject}} after he {{returned}} to the New York City area in 2016 to play for the Brooklyn Nets, Lin stated, [...] "In some ways, Linsanity wouldn't have been Linsanity if I was a different skin color, most likely, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal, and that went to my advantage, too, but if you look prior to that, a lot of the obstacles to even <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point where I could get to a position of getting on the floor, those were definitely obstacles that were very much stereotypes that I had to fight along the way. So I've always understood that there's good and there's bad and you have to take them together and just be thankful for it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This was a {{confusing}} episode of Glee. For a while, it seemed pretty unremarkable—a standard installment, meandering along enjoyably enough. But then, {{in the last}} few minutes, it suddenly got really rather dark indeed. I'm intrigued about what happens next." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Mash Off" [...] a [...] "C" [...] grade, and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential. He wrote, [...] "The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> in a bit. But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry. There's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle." [...] James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more [...] "forgettable scenes and stories".|$|E

500|$|Ndegéocello {{spent over}} a year writing the songs from Devil's Halo, being {{inspired}} in part by her trip to Ireland. [...] "I went {{to a couple of}} pubs and there were much older gentlemen playing the guitar and just singing these amazing, simple songs", Ndegéocello recalled. [...] "I really admired that. I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> kind of place where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... we see her have to survive, and just to see her go on this journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley to try to make it feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks your heart, and hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E

She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. [...] She would wake {{early in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff was {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. [...] She would average 10–12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou went through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang." [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, in order to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou stated that she played cards in order to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. [...] She stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! [...] It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|The songs, as {{recorded}} on the album, {{were influenced by}} his vacation trip to Ireland in 1973; {{it was his first}} visit since he left Belfast in 1967. [...] (At this time his parents had moved to California and resided near him.) [...] According to Erik Hage: [...] "Veedon Fleece from a lyrical standpoint, shows maturity, renewed poetical confidence, and a direct nod to actual literary influences." [...] Hage further comments that musically it [...] "can be seen as a companion album to Astral Weeks. The soft and complex musical textures (often augmented by flute) of this album are the closest he will ever again <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> vaunted 1968 album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol was {{strictly}} forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk {{in turn was}} fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase [...] "round the back for the old brandy!" [...] or [...] "the old Marlon Brando" [...] was used to announce the exit {{of one or more}} characters, or a break for music. In [...] "The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy" [...] (Series 9, Episode 4) Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, [...] "I wonder where he keeps that stuff!". In [...] "The Scarlet Capsule" [...] (Series 9, Episode 14) Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of [...] "Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there" [...] was [...] "The introductions he gives me...". [...] In [...] "The Moon Show" [...] (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating [...] "Man, the excuses he makes to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> brandy!", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail [...] "MATE!" [...] in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.|$|E

2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, so when you finally do <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> moment and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E
