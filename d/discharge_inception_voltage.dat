This means that the electric field generated by charges on a sharp conductive point is much stronger than the field generated by the same charge residing on a large smooth spherical conductive shell. When this electric field strength exceeds {{what is known as}} the corona <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> (CIV) gradient, it ionizes the air about the tip, and a small faint purple jet of plasma can be seen in the dark on the conductive tip. Ionization of the nearby air molecules result in generation of ionized air molecules having the same polarity as that of the charged tip. Subsequently, the tip repels the like-charged ion cloud, and the ion cloud immediately expands due to the repulsion between the ions themselves. This repulsion of ions creates an electric [...] "wind" [...] that emanates from the tip, which is usually accompanied by a hissing noise due to the change in air pressure at the tip. An opposite force acts on the tip that may recoil if not tight to ground.|$|E

Analysis of the partial <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> <b>voltages</b> {{for all of the}} materials tested so far shows that the major determinant of partial <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> is the breakdown voltage of the helium layer in series with the film.

40|$|High {{voltages}} and {{the edges}} of the metallization on ceramic substrates (AMB, DBA, DBC, HTCC, LTCC) lead to high electric field strengths. In the vicinity of the metal edges these high electric field strengths induce partial discharges in the ceramic insulation and in the covering synthetics and thereby represent one key degradation mechanism of power modules. In this work the correlation of the simulated electric field strength with phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) measurements has been investigated. For the simulation of the electric field strength a new method was used to bypass numerical artifacts. The simulated values showed {{that it is possible to}} reduce the electric field strength by an adaption of the metallization structure. There the distance of the upper and the lower metallization to the rim of the ceramic was changed relative to each other. Due to this variation a reduction of the electric field strength by about 30 % can be reached by choosing the optimum distance compared to state of the art modules. In PRPD measurements for ceramic substrates (AlN/Al 2 O 3 by DCB) we examined whether the field reduction leads to higher partial <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> <b>voltages</b> (PDIV).

The advantageous thermal and molecular properties make it suitable as an insulating gas, however, it is a strong green house gas. With the present climate challenges, one of the measures of reducing emission of climate gases is to phase out the use of SF$_ 6 $-insulated medium voltage switchgears. An environmentally friendly alternative is air, which has a lower withstand voltage than SF$_ 6 $. For backwards compatibility, the primary manufacturers in this development is optimization (to compensate for lower withstand) of current designs without increasing the dimensions.
