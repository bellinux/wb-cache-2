40|$|A {{solution}} is {{obtained for the}} membrane and bending stresses in a thin spherical shell due to the action of a localized bending moment or radial load which is applied through a thin cylindrical insert, for example, a <b>duct</b> <b>connection</b> on a reactor pressure vessel. The stress distribution {{will be affected by}} the nature of the duct to vessel connection. In this paper attention is confined to the case of an unreinforced junction as sketched in Fig. 1. The {{solution is}} general in so far as it is reduced to a set of four simultaneous equations which can be solved readily when dealing with practical problems. As a numerical example, the case of the Hunterston reactor pressure vessel is con-sidered, and it is shown how the localized stresses are affected by a change in duct thick-ness. Furthermore, these stresses are compared with those which would be induced in the sphere if the duct insert were rigid. It is found that in this practical example, the cylinder thickness has a significant effect on the calculated values for the stresses and displacements...|$|E
40|$|For {{the correct}} {{determination}} of sound insulation between rooms all acoustic transfer paths {{have to be}} taken into account. Thus, it is necessary to consider as well the transfer path of ventilation and air conditioning, as this can reduce the sound insulating effect of the wall construction substantially due to the direct <b>duct</b> <b>connection,</b> which is well known as cross talk. To calculate the cross talk damping, one can follow the approach delineated in VDI 2081. According to this, the transmission loss of each component on the transfer path is accumulated to the total transmission - the sound insulation of the air conditioning path. But for this also the transmission losses of the air passages are required. The following question arises: Is the transmission loss of an air passage in case of the use as inlet (the transfer from the room into the air system) different to the use as outlet (the transfer from the air system into the room) ? This is discussed in the following for simple examples by models and measurements. It starts from the view of the air outlet, where the transmission from the duct into the room is considered. Then the point of particular interest, the transmission loss of the air inlet, the transfer from the room into the duct-system, is considered. Subsequently, the transmission lines were merged to the total transfer path for predicting the flanking transmission of air conditioning systems. All measurements and calculations are carried out for the free standing, not wall mounted, configurations...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the functional-physiological {{influences on the}} depth distribution of deepwater cisco (bloater), Coregonus hoyi, in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we compared their gas bladder anatomy with the putative ancestor, shallowwater cisco, C. artedi, from a shallow inland lake. There were no general differences in the gas bladder anatomy—both coregonines possessed simple micro retia (counter-current gas multipliers) and an open pneumatic <b>duct</b> <b>connection</b> between the bladder and esophagus. Bloater possessed a significantly smaller duct diameter relative to body size in comparison with shallowwater cisco, yet the estimated {{resistance to air flow}} through the duct of bloater was ∼ 7. 2 times lower than that of cisco. In light of these findings, we discuss evidence for two modes of gas bladder inflation in bloater: 1) gas deposition via micro retia at depth, and 2) gas acquisition via aquatic surface gulping (ASG). Because the hypolimnetic distribution of adult bloater precludes them from using ASG, we infer that these fish utilize micro retia to deposit gas into their bladders. We hypothesize that bloater compensate for relatively modest rates of gas deposition by not voiding excess gas. This “gas bladder conservation (GBC) hypothesis” for bloater is supported by four pieces of evidence: 1) deepwater habitation with no access to the surface to perform ASG, 2) a lack of extensive retia and modest gas deposition rates in coregonines, 3) a tendency to bloat when brought from depth to the surface, and 4) previous findings of a confined depth range, centered around the depth of neutral buoyancy.

40|$|Duct leakage is a {{major source}} of energy loss in {{residential}} buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums, or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections, a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have shown that taped seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been testing sealant durability for several years using accelerated test methods and found that typical duct tape (i. e., cloth-backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) fails more rapidly than other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing over two years for four UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (two cloth tapes, a foil tape and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The tests involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of flexible duct to sheet metal collars. Periodic air leakage tests and visual inspection were used to document changes in sealant performance. After two years of testing, the flex-to-collar connections showed little change in air leakage, but substantial visual degradation from some products. A surprising experimental result was failure of most of the clamps used to mechanically fasten the connections. This indicates that the durability of clamps also need to be addressed ensure longevity of the <b>duct</b> <b>connection.</b> An accelerated test method developed during this study has been used as the basis for an ASTM standard (E 2342 - 03) ...|$|E

40|$|Leaky and {{disconnected}} joints in HVAC {{air distribution}} systems are extremely widespread. The average efficiency of duct systems in {{homes in the}} US is approximately 55 % with approximately 60 % of the loss due to duct leakage. Beyond the energy and emissions penalties caused by these leaks, leaky systems have detrimental comfort, health, and safety effects. The health and safety effects include the delivery of combustion products into the homes due to leakage induced depressurization. Current duct installation practice does not attempt to address the problem. This project developed a prototype Professionally Engineered Duct System that will virtually eliminate air leakage {{and that can be}} applied in new and replacement installations at the same labor cost as current designs. It uses snap-together duct fittings that will not come apart, can be applied to all types of duct systems, and cannot be separated without exceptional force. its use would require minimal changes to current installation practice.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a multi-year research {{effort to}} develop a leak-free duct system that can be readily installed within the thermal envelope. There are numerous efforts underway to improve duct system efficiency. Most of these involve modifications to current technology such as air sealing techniques like mastic and aeroseal, snap together <b>duct</b> <b>connections,</b> and greater levels of insulation. This project sought to make a more significant stride forward by introducing a duct system of a material that can be more readily sealed and can exhibit lower friction losses. The research focused {{on the use of}} smooth internal surface, low friction plastic ducts that could be easily installed with very low air leakage. The initial system concept that was proposed and researched in Phase I focused on the use of thermoformed plastic ducts installed in a recessed roof truss underneath the attic insulation. A bench top thermoformed system was developed and tested during Phase I of the project. In Phase II, a first generation duct system utilizing a resin impregnated fiberglass duct product was designed and specified. The system was installed and tested in an Atlanta area home. Following this installation research and correspondence with code officials was undertaken to alleviate the continued concern over the code acceptance of plastic ducts in above ground applications. A Committee Interpretation response was received from the International Code Council (ICC) stating that plastic ducts were allowed, but must be manufactured from materials complying with Class 0 or Class 1 rating. With assurance of code acceptance, a plastic duct system using rotomolded high density polyethylene ducts that had passed the material test requirements by impregnating the material with a fire retardant during the molding process was installed {{in the basement of a}} new ranch-style home in Madison, WI.

40|$|Currently {{waveguide}} probes {{are widely}} used in several turbomachinery applications ranging from the analysis of flow instabilities to the investigation of thermoacoustic phenomena. There are many advantages to using a waveguide probe. For example, the same sensor can be adopted for different measurement points, thus reducing {{the total number of}} sensors or a cheaper sensor with a lower operating temperature capability can be used instead of a more expensive one in case of high temperature applications. Typically, a waveguide probe is made up of a transmitting duct which connects the measurement point with a sensor housing and a damping duct which attenuates the pressure fluctuations reflected by the duct end. If properly designed (i. e. with a very long damping duct), the theoretical response of a wave guide has a monotone trend with an attenuation factor that increases with the frequency and the length of the transmitting duct. Unfortunately, the real geometry of the waveguide components and the type of connection between them have a strong influence on the behavior of the system. Even the smallest discontinuity in the <b>duct</b> <b>connections</b> can lead to a very complex frequency response and a reduced operating range. The geometry of the sensor housing itself is another element which contributes to increasing the differences between the expected and real frequency responses of a waveguide since its impedance is generally unknown. Previous studies developed by the authors have demonstrated that the replacement of the damping duct with a properly designed termination could be a good solution to increase the waveguide operating range and center it on the frequencies of interest. In detail, the termination could be used to balance the detrimental effects of discontinuities and sensor presence. In this paper an innovative waveguide system leading to a further increase of the operating range is proposed and tested. The system is based on the measurement of the pressure oscillations propagating in the transmitting duct by means of three sensors placed at different distances from the pressure tap. The pressures measured by the three sensors are then combined and processed to calculate the pressure at the transmitting duct inlet. The arrangement of the sensing elements and the geometry of the termination are designed to minimize the error of this estimation. The frequency response achieved with the proposed arrangement turns out to be very flat over a wide range of frequencies. Thanks to the minor errors in the estimation of pressure modulus and phase the probe is also suitable for the signal reconstruction both in frequency and time domain...|$|R

The experimental tests conformed to ASHRAE Standard 120 P – Methods of Testing to Determine Flow Resistance of HVAC Air Ducts and Fittings.

2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has <b>duct</b> <b>connections</b> to bile <b>ducts.</b> The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|R

It is well known that the flow of dense suspensions is prone to jamming and sedimentation effects, both of which could entail detrimental failure modes in the printing heads. A thorough understanding of the fluid dynamics of suspensions as they flow through <b>ducts</b> and <b>connections</b> is of utmost importance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a novel simulation framework and to show that it captures the main effects such as mass flow and partial jamming in a cylindrical duct test configuration. The granular suspension is a generic solder paste with solder particles immersed in a flux. The simulations are performed in the multi-phase flow solver IBOFlow. A two fluid model is used for the granular suspension and the discretization is done an Euler-Euler framework. The averaged momentum equations from Enwald et al. (1996) are solved together with the common continuity equation generating a shared pressure field. Explicit constitutive equations for the interfacial momentum transfer and particle pressure are employed. To capture the shear thinning effects of the non-Newtonian suspensions the standard Carreau rheology model is used. To study how the fluid flow affects the local volume fraction and partial jamming in the duct, simulations are performed for different applied pressure drops ranging from one to five bars. For both particle pressure models, the resulting mean bulk velocities are compared with experiments with good agreement, and partial jamming is observed. Hence, it is concluded that the proposed framework is suitable to model and simulate the granular suspension in a micro fluid contraction. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Dry eye {{syndrome}} is a multifactorial chronic disabling disease {{mainly caused by}} the functional disruptions in the lacrimal gland. The treatment involves palliation like ocular surface lubrication and rehydration. Cell therapy involving replacement of the gland is a promising alternative for providing long-term relief to patients. This study aimed to establish functionally competent lacrimal gland cultures in-vitro and explore the presence of stem cells in the native gland and the established in-vitro cultures. METHODS: Fresh human lacrimal gland from patients undergoing exenteration was harvested for cultures after IRB approval. The freshly isolated cells were evaluated by flow cytometry for expression of stem cell markers ABCG 2, high ALDH 1 levels and c-kit. Cultures were established on Matrigel, collagen and HAM and the cultured cells evaluated {{for the presence of}} stem cell markers and differentiating markers of epithelial (E-cadherin, EpCAM), mesenchymal (Vimentin, CD 90) and myofibroblastic (α-SMA, S- 100) origin by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The conditioned media was tested for secretory proteins (scIgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme) post carbachol (100 µM) stimulation by ELISA. RESULTS: Native human lacrimal gland expressed ABCG 2 (mean±SEM: 3. 1 ± 0. 61 %), high ALDH 1 (3. 8 ± 1. 26 %) and c-kit (6. 7 ± 2. 0 %). Lacrimal gland cultures formed a monolayer, in order of preference on Matrigel, collagen and HAM within 15 - 20 days, containing a heterogeneous population of stem-like and differentiated cells. The epithelial cells formed 'spherules' with <b>duct</b> like <b>connections,</b> suggestive of ductal origin.

Materials and methods. Under observation, there were 180 patients with UC confirmed endoscopically and morphologically. All patients underwent multimodal ultrasound examination of the liver, study of the biochemical signs of cytolysis and/or cholestasis with negative serological markers of viral hepatitis B, C, D and autoimmune hepatitis. Also, a biochemical study of the lipid spectrum of the blood was performed, and in patients with suspected autoimmune lesions of the liver — an analysis of the spectrum of the corresponding antibodies. Results. In 180 patients with UC, a liver damage was detected in 58 (32. 2  %) persons. Parenchymal lesions of the liver were diagnosed in 40 (22. 2  %) UC patients, and changes in the bile ducts — in 18 (10. 0  %) patients with UC. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), autoimmune hepatitis (AH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver were detected in 40 (69. 0  %) patients with UC, and lesions of extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts and gall bladder — in 18 (31. 0 %). Among the parenchymal lesions of the liver, NASH dominated (53. 5  %). AH was diagnosed in 8. 6  % of patients, PBC — in 5. 2  % of patients with UC. All patients with UC and NASH, in addition to the basic UC therapy, received the preparation of essential phospholipids in a daily dose of 1, 800 mg (2 capsules 3 times a day) for three months. After the end of treatment, only 2 (6. 5  %) patients had minor complaints. Prior to treatment, a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase by 2. 3 and 2. 2 times, respectively, was observed in all the examined patients, in combination with 3. 7 times increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase compared with the norm, which may indicate a moderate cytolysis syndrome. After the treatment, patients showed a tendency to normalize the enzymatic status, although the indices remained elevated in comparison with the norm. Conclusions. Thus, liver damage was detected in 32. 2  % of patients, predominantly in the advanced forms, with a moderate and severe course and high activity of UC.

Segment 9 bile ducts drained all three subsegments (b, c and d) in 10 cases, and only two (c and d) in 3 cases, as well as only two (c and b) of present three subsegments in 3 cases. Also, there was even one case with present 9 d subsegment and without 9 th segment duct. Those modalities are of interest in an applying and accurate interpretation and performance of diagnostic and interventional procedures, as well as in segmental, sectoral or hemihepatic resection in liver surgery...|$|R
