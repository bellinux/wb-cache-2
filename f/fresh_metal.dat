Two different starting materials were roll bonded as alternate layers up to 5 rolling cycles with 200 degrees celcius pre-heating for 3. min before each cycle. Other two types of the UFG sheets with monotonic starting materials, AA 1050 /AA 1050 and AA 6061 /AA 6061, were fabricated by the same ARB process for comparison. The AA 1050 /AA 6061 composite sheets with strong bonding between different materials were obtained and substantial grain refinement was achieved after ARB processing. It was found that two different materials in the AA 1050 /AA 6061 composite deformed in a nearly identical way during the first 3 ARB cycles. Afterwards the AA 6061 started to neck and eventually fractured. The areas around the interface of two different materials were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and {{it was found that}} the microstructure of the bonded interface was quite complex. Two types of interfacial morphologies were observed along the AA 1050 /AA 6061 interfaces: Type I is the area with direct contact of <b>fresh</b> <b>metals</b> and type II is the area with original metals with surface brittle layers in between.

The predicted and the measured tensile strength values are comparable to each other. The hardness values of the AA 1050 and AA 6061 layers in the composite are close to those measured in the monotonic material laminates, which indicated that both materials accumulated similar strain no matter if they are deformed in the composite sheets or in the single material sheets...|$|R

We use the STARLIGHT code updated with the synthetic simple SPs models computed by Maraston. Our main results are that the near-infrared light in the nuclear surroundings of the galaxies is dominated by young-/intermediate-age SPs (t ≤ 2 × 109 yr), summing from ~ 40 up to 100 per cent of the light contribution. In the nuclear aperture of two sources (NGC 1614 and NGC 3310), we detected a predominant old SP component (t > 2 × 10 ⁹ yr), while for NGC 34 and NGC 7714 the younger component prevails. Furthermore, we found evidence of a circumnuclear star formation ring-like structure and a secondary nucleus in NGC 1614, in agreement with previous studies. We also suggest that the merger/interaction experienced by three of the galaxies studied, NGC 1614, NGC 3310 and NGC 7714, can explain the lower metallicity values derived for the young SP component of these sources. In this scenario, the <b>fresh</b> unprocessed <b>metal</b> poorer gas from the destroyed/interacting companion galaxy is driven to {{the centre of the}} galaxies and mixed with the central region gas, before star formation takes place.

40|$|Oxidation of pure metals is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which the}} metal loses one or more electrons, such that the atom of the metal changes from the neutral state to a positively charge ion and reacts with oxygen to form an oxide of the metal. The oxide can form as a protective and adherent scale that slows down further oxidation, or may spall off repeatedly, exposing <b>fresh</b> <b>metal</b> surface to react with oxygen. In multicomponent alloy systems such as typical high temperature NiCrAlY bond coats, more than one oxidation mechanism may take place at once and thus, complicates the study of oxidation. To better understand the competition between formations of oxides of different compositions, a thermodynamic assessment is carried out to study the oxidation mechanism of a Ni- 27 Cr- 9 Al (at-%) ternary alloy. Based on the assessment, it is demonstrated that the layering of different oxides can be determined, with the most stable oxide (alumina) existing directly above the metal/oxide interface and the least stable oxide (nickel oxide) locating on the outermost layer.

The pressure on the Li/Li 2 CO 3 core/shell particle {{was measured to be}} ∼ 15 MPa at the initiation of fracture and the conductivity of the Li 2 CO 3 shell is estimated to be ∼ 10 − 6 S/cm. To simulate the application of the core-shell particles in a real battery, we assembled coin cells with Li metal as a counter electrode. Prior to the cell assembly, the electrode was compressed in order to break the Li 2 CO 3 shells to expose the <b>fresh</b> lithium <b>metal</b> to the graphite. When the electrolyte is added to wet the electrode, an electrochemical reaction spontaneously occurs between the exposed Li and graphite particles to produce a partially lithiated graphite anode.

Incorporation of manure amendment to the soils reduced the availability of trace elements and consequently reduced their uptake by spinach. Zinc contents of sandy loam and silt loam soils declined by 44.9 and 29.3 % with the application manure: leaf litter of 1 : 3 as compared to the manure treatment without leaf litter (1 : 0).

40|$|The {{in-flight}} oxidation {{of stainless}} steel particles in the plasma jet was investigated in this work. Two types of 316 L austenitic stainless steel particles were sprayed by a dc plasma gun in ambient or controlled atmosphere varying gun parameters and surrounding gases composition. The in-flight collected particles were characterized to establish relationship between spray parameters and particle oxidation behavior. The in-flight particle oxidation mechanisms were then suggested. It was shown that besides diffusion based oxidation, convective oxidation in the particles can occur within the plasma jet core if plasma to particle kinematic viscosities ratio and relative Reynolds number (Re) are superior to 55 and 20, respectively. In these conditions, the oxide formed or oxygen dissolved at {{the surface of the}} liquid particle can be swept into its interior forming isolated oxide nodules. <b>Fresh</b> liquid <b>metal</b> is transported from interior towards particle surface. The oxidation rates were estimated to be higher compared to diffusion based oxidation which was found to be the dominant phenomenon in the plasma jet plume in the absence of convective oxidation. Spray parameters leading to higher kinematic viscosities ratio and Re, such as increasing arc current, hydrogen content in the plasma forming gases, or decreasing sprayed particle size range, resulted in enhanced convective oxidation in the plasma core. The diffusion based oxidation of particles in the plasma jet plume can be principally controlled by their size (specific surface area), temperature and velocity (dwell time) and the molar fraction of oxidizing and reducing species in the plasma jet. While investigating the influence of the atmosphere of plasma jet on the in-flight particle oxidation, {{it was found that the}} surface area of the oxide nodules and the mass percentage of total oxygen in collected particles followed a parabolic and linear relationship with p O 2 in the surrounding atmosphere.
