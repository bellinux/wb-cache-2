His father was, unlike him, elected as a Conservative, although Hopkinson was a generally reliable vote for the Conservatives in this period.

25|$|The mercenaries of the Ever Victorious Army, {{comprising}} some of {{the worse}} social elements of China, Britain and the United States were notorious for their practice whenever they marched into a new district of stealing everything while raping all of the women, which led Gordon to impose harsh discipline, with those soldiers accused of looting and/or rape being taken out and shot. Gordon also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> defeating Burgevine (a man whom Gordon detested) who had raised a mercenary force and joined the Taipings. After Gordon had surrounded Burgevine's force outside of Soochow, the latter had abandoned his own men and attempted to rejoin the Imperial side, which led Gordon to arrest him and send him to the American consul in Shanghai together with a letter asking that Burgevine be expelled from China.|$|E
25|$|In a low-scoring thriller at The County Ground, Derby, Dominic Cork <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> beating his old county, {{though it}} became a tougher task than expected, {{considering}} that Derbyshire had not won a Championship match since 2004. Winning the toss and batting, Derbyshire had a good opening partnership between Australian Michael Di Venuto and Ben France, but Greg Chapple put the pressure on with some patient, economical bowling and reaped the rewards with three wickets for 29. However, it was Cork who got the most wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead. Muralitharan was, indeed, in contention for Man of the Match, bowling 27 overs in succession and taking six for 50 as Derbyshire collapsed to 185, setting a target of 136 to win. Lancashire {{thought that would be}} a walk in the park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9. Only Sutcliffe kept his head calm, carrying his bat to 62 not out, and he and Muralitharan managed to add the required five runs.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, {{while trying}} to arrange a match against Anderssen, Staunton met von der Lasa in Brussels. The two began a match, but had to abandon {{it in the middle}} of the thirteenth game, with von der Lasa leading (five wins, four losses, and three draws). Staunton was unfit to {{continue}} because of heart palpitations, which had affected him in the second match against Saint-Amant in 1843. In von der Lasa's opinion there was no chance that Staunton's health would be good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards.Note: some writers say Staunton and von der Lasa played a match in Berlin in 1844; but Staunton wrote in the Chess Player's Chronicle that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> making the personal acquaintance of von der Lasa in their 1853 encounter—see ...|$|E
500|$|As a director, Weitz <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> {{introducing}} and filming on new {{locations and}} sets. Of particular interest was the Quileute reservation and Jacob's house. Using the Quileute country in Washington as a basis, the production team decided to place Jacob's {{house on the}} edges of the territory, rather than in the community, because of Jacob's attachment to the wolves. To Weitz, Jacob's house was the stepping stone into the forest world, where the reality of the werewolves is hidden. The production designer was faced with a [...] "real world" [...] versus [...] "book world" [...] challenge when the barn they located, described in the book as a red barn, was green. Initially bordered by a green fence, the decision of painting the barn, aging it, and renovating the exterior proved to be a layout that fit well with Jacob's character.|$|E
