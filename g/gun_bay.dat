5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the <b>gun</b> <b>bay,</b> and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

2500|$|The B-type wing was {{structurally}} an A type {{modified to}} carry one 20mm Hispano cannon per wing, which replaced the two inner [...]303 machine guns. The retractable underwing landing lamp was repositioned. The cannon {{was installed in}} the innermost machine <b>gun</b> <b>bay,</b> next to the wheelwell, while the second gun was deleted altogether. The area where the inner guns ammunition trays had been located, outboard of the cannon bay, was converted into a compartment to accommodate the 60-round drum magazine for the cannon. The upper and lower wing skins now incorporated blisters to clear the large ammunition drum (the underwing blisters came in two different shapes). The remaining outer pairs of [...]303's were not changed at all. Only one armament suite could be fitted to a Spitfire with the B-type wing: Two 20mm Hispano Mk II cannon, each with a 60-round drum, and four [...]303 caliber Browning machine guns in the outer positions, with 350 rpg. Alloy-covered ailerons were standardised on this wing type.|$|E

5000|$|The Re.2005 was a low-wing, single-engine, single-seat fighter monoplane, made {{of light}} alloys. Propulsion was by a [...] Daimler Benz DB.605A-1 engine, either of {{original}} German production or built by Fiat as the RA.1050 RC.58 Tifone (Typhoon), driving a right-handed three-bladed Piaggio P.2001 constant speed, mechanically controlled variable-pitch metal propeller. The streamlined but tiny fuselage was almost totally {{dominated by the}} DB 605 engine and did not allow for fuel storage. As well, the fuselage-mounted MG 151/20 cannon had less ammunition than those mounted in the wings (150 rounds versus 170 rounds in the wing <b>gun</b> <b>bays</b> from the second prototype on). The comparable Fiat G.55 had 250 rounds for the fuselage gun, but also 600 for a 12.7 mm machine gun. The smaller Re.2005 also carried 100 less 20 mm but 100 more 12.7 mm rounds, with an overall lighter armament array.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1953, Garrison took {{command of}} the 335th FIS. The [...] "GunVal Project", seven F-86s and five veteran pilots, was {{attached}} to the squadron to test armament modifications in combat. North American Aviation removed the six M3 [...]50-caliber machine guns from four late-production F-86Es and six block-one F-86Fs, expanded the size of the <b>gun</b> <b>bays,</b> strengthened the surrounding frame assemblies, and mounted four newly developed T-160 20mm cannon in their place. Having a similar rate of fire, the cannons were expected to significantly increase the Sabre's lethality over that of the machine guns, whose armor-piercing incendiary ammunition was usually ineffective against jet aircraft above 35,000 feet of altitude. However, the heavier weight and bulk of the cannons and ammunition, while providing greater effective range, flatter trajectory, and higher velocity, limited the F-86 to only 400 total rounds, which reduced its total firing time by nearly 75%, from 16 to 4.6 seconds.|$|R
2500|$|Different {{propeller}} types were fitted, {{according to}} where the Spitfire V was built: Supermarine and Westland manufactured VBs and VCs used 10ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter, 3 bladed de Havilland constant speed units, with narrow metal blades, while Castle Bromwich manufactured VBs and VCs were fitted with a wide bladed Rotol constant speed propeller of either 10ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter, with metal blades, or (on late production Spitfires) 10ft 3 in (3.12 m) diameter, with broader, [...] "Jablo" [...] (compressed wood) blades. The Rotol spinners were longer and more pointed than the de Havilland leading to a 3.5 in (8.9cm) increase in overall length. The Rotol propellers allowed a modest speed increase over [...] {{and an increase in}} the service ceiling. A large number of Spitfire VBs were fitted with [...] "gun heater intensifier" [...] systems on the exhaust stacks. These piped additional heated air into the <b>gun</b> <b>bays.</b> There was a short tubular intake {{on the front of the}} first stack and a narrow pipe led into the engine cowling from the rear exhaust.|$|R
50|$|In early 1957, Cockade {{took part}} in the Malayan Emergency as part of the 8th Destroyer Squadron.

Later in 1957 Cockade was stationed at Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|The cannon, {{mounted in}} {{the lower part of}} the port fuselage, was fed by a 725-round drum behind the pilot's seat. With its firing rate of 6,000 rounds per minute, the cannon would empty the drum after just over 7 seconds of {{continuous}} fire. The cannon was omitted in all the two-seat models and some single-seat versions, including reconnaissance aircraft and the early Italian F-104S, with the <b>gun</b> <b>bay</b> and ammunition tank typically replaced by additional fuel tanks. The gun's location was advantageous as gun-flash was not in the pilot's line of sight, therefore not robbing him of night-adjusted vision.|$|E
5000|$|The ALQ-218 is the {{featured}} system aboard the U.S. Navy's EA-18 Growler aircraft, which was slated {{to replace the}} EA-6B Prowler in the U.S. Navy.

2500|$|The F6F-5 {{featured}} several improvements {{including a}} more powerful R-2800-10W engine employing a water-injection system and housed in a slightly more streamlined engine cowling, spring-loaded control tabs on the ailerons, and an improved, clear view windscreen, with a flat armored-glass front panel replacing the F6F-3's curved plexiglass panel and internal armor glass screen. In addition, the rear fuselage and tail units were strengthened, and, apart from some early production aircraft, {{the majority of the}} F6F-5's built were painted in an overall gloss sea blue finish. After the first few F6F-5s were built, the small windows behind the main canopy were deleted. The F6F-5N night fighter variant was fitted with an AN/APS-6 radar in a fairing on the outer-starboard wing. A small number of standard F6F-5s were also fitted with camera equipment for reconnaissance duties as the F6F-5P. While all F6F-5s were capable of carrying an armament mix of one 20mm (.79in) M2 cannon in each of the inboard <b>gun</b> <b>bays</b> (220 rounds per gun), along with two pairs of [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns [...] (each with 400 rounds per gun), this configuration was only used on later F6F-5N night fighters.

5000|$|Formed in late 1953 at Yokota Air Base, Japan under Fifth Air Force and {{equipped}} with some RF-86F [...] "Haymaker" [...] photo-reconnaissance jets modified in Japan by fitting {{a suite of}} photo-reconnaissance cameras at the Tsuiki REMCO facility in Japan, in a project code-named *Haymaker*. All armament, radars, and gunsights were removed, and a camera suite installed with two K-22 and one K-17 cameras in an under-fuselage installation. The cameras were mounted vertically, which took {{the main body of}} the camera and the film magazines outside the fuselage contours in a bulge on the <b>gun</b> <b>bay</b> door. A total of eight were built (serial numbers 52-4337, 4379,4492, 4800, 4808, 4822, 4823, and 4864). They were flown over North Korea on clandestine reconnaissance missions after the war ended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{east end}} of Grand Cayman has long been well known for the treacherous reefs which lie under the ocean's surface just off its coast, {{and was in the}} past known as the [...] "Graveyard of the Caribbean". The area was the site of the island's most famous shipwreck, the Wreck of the Ten Sail, in 1794; miraculously, only eight lives were lost in the {{disaster}} when ten merchant vessels ran aground in rough seas. The area was sparsely inhabited at the time, but local residents banded together with some inhabitants of Bodden Town to assist the crews of the wrecked ships. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, Eastern Channel in <b>Gun</b> <b>Bay</b> was designated a port of entry for the East End area. Much business was conducted there; the channel was trafficked by ships leaving and arriving on fishing and turtling trips, and by freight- and mail-carrying vessels as well.|$|E
2500|$|The A-type was the {{original}} wing design, with eight [...]303 calibre Browning machine guns, with 300 rounds per gun (rpg). The basic structure of the wing was unchanged until the C type in 1942. The one major alteration made to this wing, soon after production started, was the incorporation of a heating system for the <b>gun</b> <b>bays,</b> to prevent the guns from freezing up at high altitudes. To achieve this, open structures, such as wing ribs, surrounding the gun-bays were closed off, forming closed <b>bays</b> for each <b>gun.</b> Ducting was added, which drew heated air from the engine radiator and transferred it into the now-closed weapon-bays. Underwing vents, covered by streamlined triangular blisters just inboard of the wingtips, extracted the air, creating a negative pressure differential, and caused more heated air to be drawn in, ensuring {{a steady supply of}} heated air without any need for a mechanical blower. To keep cold air from blowing in via the muzzle openings in the leading edge, they were sealed with red fabric adhesive tape by ground crew while loading the ammunition trays. The guns fired through the tape, so they were no longer sealed after combat. Towards the end of 1940, the fabric covered ailerons were replaced by ones covered in light alloy. The A-type wing was only compatible with the 8 × [...]303 Browning machine gun armament suite.|$|R
