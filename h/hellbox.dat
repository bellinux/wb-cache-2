50|$|A <b>hellbox</b> is a {{receptacle}} where {{cast metal}} sorts are thrown after printing. The job of sorting the type from the <b>hellbox</b> {{and putting it}} back into the job case was given to the apprentice, known as a printer's devil. Later, when continuous casting or hot metal typesetting machines such as the Linotype and Monotype became popular, the <b>hellbox</b> was used for storing discarded or broken type that were melted down and recast.|$|E
50|$|One likely source {{stems from}} the fact that worn and broken lead type is thrown into a <b>hellbox,</b> which the printer's devil must take to the furnace for melting and recasting.|$|E
50|$|Some of Fass' <b>Hellbox</b> {{imprints}} were custom {{bound in}} fine leather by another YMCA resident, John Archer, who was {{supervisor of the}} print shop and book bindery at the New York Public Library.|$|E

50|$|Fass {{created his}} first YMCA {{printing}} projects using the imprint name Hell-Box Press, {{named for a}} print shop <b>hellbox,</b> in which printers threw used metal type for recasting. Fass' hobby was woodworking, so he created miniature wooden printing presses for his Hell-Box printing endeavors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930 Fass used his miniature, 14-inch-high presses to create booklets, bookplates, Christmas cards, and ephemera. He inked the letters with his fingertip.|$|E
5000|$|Helland {{released}} seven albums {{under his}} own name beginning with the experimental <b>Hellbox</b> Mood Rings CD in 1996. In 2000, he released an ambient/instrumental/new age CD called Space Age Tranceology [...] "and made the striking transition to atmospheric soundtracks." [...] In the same year he composed music for the film Riders. Songs from his 2002 CD release, Earthbound, were played on the syndicated radio program Echoes. In 2006, he released the all acoustic 12 song Catapult album with his tribute to the BBC series {{of the same name}} Monarch of the Glen. He formed Scott Helland and the Traveling Band of Gypsy Nomads in 2005 with French-born singer and percussionist Samantha Stephenson, which later became Frenchy and the Punk.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Delanty {{received}} the distinguished Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award (given to an Irish poet {{who has not}} previously published a book), and in 1986 his first full-length work, Cast in the Fire (Dolmen Press) appeared. That same year he {{received the}} Allan Dowling Poetry Fellowship, judged by Christopher Ricks, the award of $20,000 stipulated {{that he had to}} travel to the United States for a brief period.Since 1987, Delanty has been associated with Saint Michael College, Vermont, initially as a teacher and currently as poet-in-residence. It is here that his poems began to explore the themes of exile and family which would dominate his later work. His collection American Wake (Blackstaff, 1995), which envisions a fifth Irish province ‘where all exiles naturally land’, was followed by The <b>Hellbox</b> (Oxford University Press, 1998), whose title alludes to the printing trade to which his father had devoted his life. The Blind Stitch (Carcanet, 2001), extends the geography of Delanty’s poems to include India, and was followed by The Ship of Birth (Carcanet Press, 2007), a collection inspired by fatherhood and committed to ‘affirming the sustaining continuity of life’. Collected Poems 1986-2006 was published by Carcanet/Oxford Poets in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The final mission, Der Flakturm, has {{the player}} landing atop a {{partially}} destroyed flak tower (flakturm), {{in the middle}} of the city of Essen (the name of the specific flak tower is not mentioned in the game). He and his men must battle their way down, encountering heavy resistance, to place demolition charges and destroy it from the inside. After infiltrating the inner most facilities in the tower, Travers realizes that he is the only one left from his squadron. He then travels deep below the tower where he meets with an engineer, who has placed massive amounts of explosives on the foundations of the tower, ready to destroy it. Travers enters into sewers to follow the wire that leads to [...] "Hellbox" [...] (a device used to detonate the explosive stock). On his way through sewers, he fights many Storm Elite soldiers, alone. When he finally reaches the surface, he finds the fatally wounded American engineer, trying to activate the <b>Hellbox.</b> Before he is able to reach it, he dies, so Travers takes and activates it. The tower explodes, along with any remaining German soldiers in it. The final scene shows a fleet of C-47 Skytrains flying over the tower, now engulfed in flames.|$|E
