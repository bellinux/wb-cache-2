These specialized fuel injectors have nozzle diameters of 150 - 200 [mu]m which {{are susceptible to}} clogging from deposit formation. This thesis studies the deposit formation mechanisms with a thin fuel film reactor, and examines the potential {{for use of the}} reactor as a detergent screening tool. Through experimentation with the thin fuel film reactor it was found that temperature had negligible effect on the weight of a fully dried fuel film. This suggests that testing could be conducted at high or low temperatures to decrease the cycle time or increase test resolution respectively. It was also determined that dry deposits remain soluble in hot fuel immediately following drying, but become insoluble after long <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> <b>periods.</b> A simple deposit formation model was constructed based on hypothesized formation factors. Although very simplified, the model matched the experimental results well. The correlation suggest that the hypothesized formation factors are critical to the formation process. The model should be expanded to explain deposit formation more generally, and further research should be conducted to better validate the model. by Orian Welling. Thesis (S. B.)

A significant amount of water is used in this soaking operation which is then discharged as wastewater. The continuous discharge of this wastewater has become an environmental concern in the paddy parboiling industry in Sri Lanka. In this study important characteristics of the effluent generated from two existing paddy soaking operations practiced in Sri Lanka namely <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking were initially determined. This analysis was done for wastewater resulting from soaking two rice varieties available locally, namely LD 356 a red rice and BG 300 which is a white rice. Characterization study showed pollutant levels higher in paddy soak wastewater than the stipulated local discharge standards (Appendix C). Wastewater generated from both <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking of red rice variety showed relatively higher COD and BOD values compared to those of wastewater from white rice variety. <b>Hot</b> <b>soaking</b> wastewater had higher COD and BOD values than cold soaking wastewater. The wastewater generated from <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> of red rice which showed higher pollutant strength is further studied for pollutant removalmethods.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} popular food in Sri Lanka where {{approximately}} 70 % of the paddy production goes through the parboiling process. Parboiling process is a hydrothermal treatment method. This treatment process consumes energy, water and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluents and wastages back to environment which cause adverse environmental impacts. Total environmental input and output emissions of the parboiling process depend on the selected treatment method and the type of equipment used. Therefore the total environmental effects of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly paddy parboiling method. The overall objective of this work is to assess environmental impacts of different parboiled paddy production methods adopted in Sri Lanka by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a methodological context to estimate the environmental effects caused by the life cycle of a product, service or process. Goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation are the four major steps in LCA methodology. The environmental performance of three parboiling methods named as modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and mechanical drying, modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and sun drying and semi modern method with cold soaking and sun drying were assessed and compared quantitatively and qualitatively.

30|$|The role of {{molecular}} diffusion in recovering oil from tight and shale oil reservoirs has been examined in previous work (Chen et al. 2014; Sanchez-Rivera et al. 2015; Wan and Sheng 2015). The CME-GEM simulator {{was used to}} examine the possible influential factors that decide the oil response in the huff-n-puff process. The simulation results indicate that longer <b>soaking</b> <b>periods</b> recover less oil than shorter soaking times. They suggested that no <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> is required in the huff-n-puff process in the Bakken shale. This statement is in contradiction with the experimental results mentioned earlier (Gamadi et al. 2013; Yu and Sheng 2016). The disagreement between experimental data and simulation methods indicates that more effort is required in understanding the mechanisms happening in the soaking process. Molecular diffusion effects in the <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> were found to be important in huff-n-puff recovery prediction. The effect {{of molecular}} diffusion in cyclic gas injection on shale oil recovery has been investigated (Wan and Sheng 2015; Wan et al. 2015). Comparison of the laboratory data with the numerical simulation results shows that without the diffusion effect included in the simulation model a lower recovery factor is predicted than experimentally observed. Chen and Gu (2017) used a simulation approach to investigate the optimal injection and production duration in a cycle to achieve the maximum oil recovery. The sensitivity analyses show that short injection and production periods were favorable for CO 2 huff-n-puff performance. A series of sensitivity studies of CO 2 huff-n-puff EOR in shale oil reservoirs was examined (Alfarge et al. 2017 b; Kong et al. 2016; Sheng 2015; Yu et al. 2014). The simulation results show that the most influential variables are injection time, CO 2 injection rate and the number of cycles employed. However, CO 2 soaking, fracture half-length and permeability were listed as less sensitive parameters to simulation output, while they are influential in the experimental EOR process. The <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> is not a critical factor to improved oil recovery by gas huff-n-puff in shale oil reservoirs (Boosari et al. 2015). CO 2 huff-n-puff is more favorable for reservoirs with high heterogeneity by using long hydraulic fractures (Yu et al. 2015).|$|R

The EC test, regardless of the number of seeds or <b>soaking</b> <b>period,</b> was not adequate for evaluating the physiological quality of color- or size-classified seed lots from P. moniliformis Benth. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} the proximate and mineral elements constituents of water soaked Jack Bean (Carnavalia ensiformis) seeds. The seeds {{were subjected to}} four treatments which comprised: 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs soaking in cold water with each treatment made up of three replicates. After the expiration of each <b>soaking</b> <b>period,</b> the water was discarded, sun-dried for 7 days and thereafter milled to pass through 1 mm sieve and subjected to laboratory analysis. The study revealed the following: dry matter increased after 96 hrs of soaking. Crude protein (CP) however decreased in value from 21 % to 17 %. Soaking for 48 hrs led {{to a reduction in}} the crude fibre (CF) content of seeds. Prolonged <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> of 96 hrs increased the ether extract (EE) level. However, total ash content was reduced in seeds soaked for 96 hrs soaking. Soaking for 96 hrs increased Mg, Fe and Cu contents but Zn content recorded a decrease. Differences between treatments for all the parameters considered in the study were significant (P < 0. 01) ...|$|R
