He was such a studious apprentice that he soon became a good artist himself. He painted the altar doors of the Carrier's guild (Zakkendragersgilde, a guild for turf carriers and other cart trades) in the St. Bavochurch. The altar itself had been painted earlier by Jacob van Haarlem, the master of Mostaert. The altar door subjects were designed by Rijck, and were the history of Joseph (son of Jacob); one side was devoted to his brothers who came for grain, and the other side was Joseph himself seated like a king, hiding his identity for his brothers in Egypt; pieces which were highly praised. Rijck was a successful painter who painted many pieces in Friesland, but most of these were destroyed during the Beeldenstorm.|$|E
40|$|When designing, {{engineering}} and constructing the <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> of a blast furnace, traditional thinking {{predicts that the}} <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> will erode to {{the locations of the}} 1, 150 ˚C isotherm. This philosophy is {{based on the fact that}} at elevated carbon content (> 2 %), iron solidifies at 1, 150 ˚C. In strict thermo-chemical theory, it is impossible for a carbon <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> refractory to wear beyond that point. Operators even use this theory in their online thermal models to estimate current wear by extrapolating the location of the 1, 150 ˚C isotherm from actual temperature measurements. As we will show examples of in this paper, the theory fails to explain why in reality, most large-block hearth walls experience much more severe wear over their lifetimes. It is often reported that block hearth walls have minimal refractory remaining, the carbon blocks are cracked and brittle, and that the wear dictated the end of the furnace campaign, or at least a major repair. Such results are inconsistent with the theory, yet its use continues without regard for its shortcomings. It is also well known that oxidation, thermal stress and chemical attack occur at such elevated temperatures in the blast furnace <b>hearth</b> <b>wall.</b> This paper discuss these root causes of hearth failure in more detail and suggest how these should be taken in consideration when selecting refractory materials and designing hearth walls for best performance in modern high productivity blast furnaces, in line with steel companies’ continuous drive for better results...|$|E

40|$|To {{prolong the}} {{campaign}} {{life of the}} furnace hearth for high demand in the steel market, the theme of preventing the <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> from erosion phenomenon is worthily studied for steel industry. The titanium carbide (TiC) concentration distributions in the blast furnace hearth {{can be used to}} suppress the erosion phenomenon of the <b>hearth</b> <b>wall.</b> In this work, we solve the momentum and the thermal-energy-balance equations, as well as the mass transfer equation with chemical reaction effects to investigate the TiC concentration profiles in the hearth of Port Kembla no. 5 blast furnace (PKBF 5) by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, Fluent (version 6. 2). As shown in the results, the elephant foot erosion and pot-like erosion in the hearth may be restrained based on the calculated TiC concentration distributions. Additionally, this work illustrates that deadman type may be inferred based on the calculated TiC concentration profiles when the blast furnace is revamped...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A {{study of}} the use of {{electrical}} resistance tomography for imaging <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> thickness is reported. A significant challenge is to acquire accurate measurements of the very low resistivity in the hearth which is constructed with graphite bricks (conductivity = 2. 5 ´ 104 S/m). A noise model of the blast furnace for electrical measurements, an experimental ‘cold ’ furnace model (0. 5 m in diameter) and a 3 -D simulation model are established.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to numerically simulate iron flow and heat transfer in the hearth of a blast furnace by solving the three-dimensional turbulent Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the transport equation of energy at steady state. Under the effects of conjugate heat transfer and natural convection, a computational fluid dynamic calculation was performed to generate flow field in the hearth and the temperature distribution in the refractories during the tapping process. The accuracy and computation of the model is validated using operation data from BHP Steel's No. 5 blast furnace. The shear stress and heat flux on the wall were then predicted for the different vertical movements, shapes of the coke zone (dead-man), and the lengths of the tap-hole. As shown in the results, it is worth noticing that an increase in the tap-hole length causes the peak values of shear stress to shift in the increasing azimuthal direction at a particular plane, and the location of the peak value of shear stress coincides with the location of higher temperature actually measured on the <b>hearth</b> <b>wall,</b> signifying enhanced heat transfer to the wall at location of peak stress.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to {{validate}} a method for the determination of VOCs in human breath sample. These compounds {{can be associated with}} a physiologic imbalance of the body that can lead to an oxidative stress, which is an alteration in the concentration of oxidant agent inside the organism. This disease can manifest with an exceed of species like peroxides and free radicals, which can cause grave illness like arteriosclerosis, Parkinson syndrome, pulmonary embolism and so on. The main problem in the analysis of VOCs is their instability. The proposed solution is to use a derivatization agent in order to form stable adduct of those analytes, and then analyze them with chromatographic technique. The innovation in this technique lie {{in the fact that the}} derivatization agent is applied directly on the sampler device, specifically Thermal Desorption Tubes. Using a loading device the sample is passed through the stationary phase, while other data like flow rate and CO 2 concentration can still be recorded. The sample are then analyzed with gas chromatographic technique, using a Thermal Desorber in order to release the compounds. Thanks to the Mass Spectrometer coupled with the thermal desorber it is possible to both identificate and quantificate the species. A possible application for this method, is the develop of an instrument for the monitoring of the breath of patient at risk of pulmonary embolism, like for example person subject to deep vein thrombosis at their leg, people that has been operated recently or that are frequently subject to traumas. With the variation of the haematocrit, these categories can develop a blood clot in the vein that, if it’s small enough, can pass through the <b>hearth</b> <b>wall</b> and cause a pulmonary embolism. A second application of this method would be the monitoring of preterm newborn, subject to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, a grave disease that hit almost exclusively infants born ahead of time. Nowadays we’re still not sure on what’s the cause of this disease, but if it’s diagnosed in time it can be cured, giving the newborn a normal life expectancy...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{constructions of}} {{electric}} ferroalloy furnaces are still based on applying {{in the lower}} "liquid " areas the standard carbon materials. What can be illustrated by the experience from several years, {{in the part of}} tap hole, <b>hearth</b> <b>walls</b> and bottom, is that so-called carbon or semigraphite microporous materials are suc-cessfully being applied. These materials, compared to the standard carbon, give better resistance to the attack by liquid metal and other wear factors. Generally this group includes materials characterised by considerable share of pores of diameters below 1 μm (significantly exceeding 90 % of total porosity). The microporosity increases the resistance to the infiltration of the liquid metal. The effect of microporosity can be obtained by introducing silicon (or its compound) additive to materials based on electrically (or gas) calcined anthracites, electrographite and binder. Moreover, by introducing other ceramic additives, the microporous materials are more resistant to dissolution by the liquid metal. Observing the trends of "improving the materials " in the last years, it is clearly seen that the share of non-carbon additives is bigger and bigger, so we can reasonably speak of rather carbon-ceramic materials. In this paper, the survey of the most important quality criteria, which must be met by the carbon furnace linings, as well as the new testing methods will be presented. 1...|$|R

This research analyzes the feasibility of waste heat recovery and assesses energy efficiency at a steel company, Gerdau Ameristeel in Selkirk, Manitoba. The process heating assessment and survey tool (PHAST) determined that the overall efficiency in the reheat furnace is 60 %. Flue gas losses are the biggest energy losses in the reheat furnace, accounting for 29. 5 % of the total energy losses during full production. Heat losses from <b>wall,</b> <b>hearth</b> and roof are also significant, being 7, 139, 170 Â kJ/h during full production. To reduce energy inefficiencies, it is recommended that billets be preheated to 315 Â Â°C in the reheat furnace. This requires 1. 48 Â h to capture waste heat with a preheating section length of 1691. 64 Â cm. The annual energy savings are estimated to be $ 215, 086. 12 requiring a 3. 03 years payback period.
