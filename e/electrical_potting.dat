2500|$|Polyurethanes {{are used}} in the {{manufacture}} of high-resilience foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam seals and gaskets, durable elastomeric wheels and tires (such as roller coaster, escalator, shopping cart, elevator, and skateboard wheels), automotive suspension bushings, <b>electrical</b> <b>potting</b> compounds, high performance adhesives, surface coatings and surface sealants, [...] synthetic fibers (e.g., Spandex), carpet underlay, hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments), condoms, and hoses.|$|E
50|$|Polyurethanes {{prepared}} from HTPB can be engineered {{for specific}} physical properties; polyurethanes may be highly elastic or tough and rigid. Some products include: rigid foam insulation panels; durable elastomeric wheels and tires (used for roller coasters, escalators, skateboards, etc.); automotive suspension bushings; <b>electrical</b> <b>potting</b> compounds; high-performance adhesives; surface coatings and surface sealants; synthetic fibers (e.g., Spandex); carpet underlay; hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{manufacturing method}} is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized by being impregnated with <b>electrical</b> epoxy <b>potting</b> systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180°C, Class H rating.|$|R
40|$|Rugged module {{package for}} thin film hybrid microcircuits {{incorporated}} a rigid, thermally conductive support structure, {{which serves as}} a heat sink, and a lead wire block in which T-shaped <b>electrical</b> connectors are <b>potted.</b> It protects the circuitry from shock and vibration loads, dissipates internal heat, and simplifies electrical connections between adjacent modules...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermally}} conductive polymer is provided having {{physical and chemical}} properties suited to use as a medium for <b>potting</b> <b>electrical</b> components. The polymer is prepared from hydroquinone, phenol, and formaldehyde, by conventional procedures employed for the preparation of phenol-formaldehyde resins. While the proportions of the monomers can be varied, a preferred polymer is formed from the monomers in a 1 : 1 : 2. 4 molar or ratio of hydroquinone:phenol:formaldehyde...|$|R
5000|$|Thermosetting polymer {{mixtures}} {{based on}} thermosetting resin monomers and pre-polymers can be formulated and applied and processed {{in a variety}} of ways to create distinctive cured properties that cannot be achieved with thermoplastic polymers or inorganic materials. Application/process uses and methods for thermosets include protective coating, seamless flooring, civil engineering construction grouts for jointing and injection, mortars, foundry sands, adhesives, sealants, castings, <b>potting,</b> <b>electrical</b> insulation, encapsulation, 3D printing, solid foams, wet lay-up laminating, pultrusion, gelcoats, filament winding, pre-pregs, and molding. Specific methods of molding thermosets are: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} high {{humidity}} (95 % RH) at 60 C, 70 C, 85 C and 100 C on the solid-to-liquid reversion of polyurethane elastomers (used for <b>potting</b> <b>electrical</b> connectors and conformal coating printed circuit boards) was investigated. Hardness measurements {{were conducted on}} eleven elastomers to track reversion for a 101 -day period. The {{primary purpose of the}} tests was to provide data to predict service life for the polyurethane elastomers. This was not accomplished as the hardness did not deteriorate rapidly enough at the lower test temperatures. The tests did determine that the potting and coating materials most widely used on the S- 1 C Program are susceptible to reversion but appear adequate for service in the S- 1 C environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess methodologies for the {{nutritional}} monitoring of gerbera cultivated on substrate. The experiment {{was carried out}} in greenhouse, in Botucatu (22 ° 51 ’S and 48 ° 26 ’W), São Paulo State, Brazil. Five substrate formulations were used and two gerbera cultivars, Red and Cherry, were transplanted to 1 -liter <b>pots.</b> <b>Electrical</b> conductivity (EC) and pH of the substrate solution were determined at 1, 15, 29, 43 and 50 days after acclimation (DAA) by adopting the methodologies “pourthru”, dilution of 1 : 2 (substrate volume/water volume) and dilution of 1 : 5 (substrate mass /water volume). For the dilution methods, the substrate was removed from the pots, separated from the roots, homogenized and air dried before analysis. In each assessment, 40 pots were used. Linear correlations established among the methodologies were obtained according to the Pearson’s method. EC values of the substrate solution were higher when the method “pourthru” was used due to the lower sample dilution {{and the nature of the}} solution displacement in the container. Significant correlations validate the methods while for periodic monitoring, nutritional analysis and eventual correction can be more effectively done by adopting the method “pourthru” since the displacement of the substrate solution using the non-destructive method reduces the costs and accelerates the response...|$|R
