Natural (tobas) or man-made (johads), both types of small, intermittent ponds, are often the only source of water for animals and humans in the true desert areas. The lack of a constant water supply causes much of the local population to live as nomads. Most human settlements are found near the two seasonal streams of the Karon-Jhar hills. Potable groundwater is also rare in the Thar desert. Supplies are often sour due to dissolved minerals, and are only available deep underground. Wells that successfully bear sweet water attract nearby settlement, but are difficult to dig, possibly claiming the lives of the well-diggers.According to 1980 housing census in Pakistan, there were 241,326 housing units of one or two very small rooms.

40|$|The looping of {{polymers}} such as DNA is {{a fundamental}} process in the molecular biology of living cells, whose interior is characterised by a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> molecular <b>crowding.</b> We here investigate in detail the looping dynamics of flexible polymer chains in the presence <b>of</b> different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding.</b> From {{the analysis of the}} looping-unlooping rates and the looping probabilities of the chain ends we show that the presence of small crowders typically slow down the chain dynamics but larger crowders may in fact facilitate the looping. We rationalise these non-trivial and often counterintuitive effects of the crowder size onto the looping kinetics in terms of an effective solution viscosity and standard excluded volume effects. Thus for small crowders the effect of an increased viscosity dominates, while for big crowders we argue that confinement effects (caging) prevail. The tradeoff between both trends can thus result in the impediment or facilitation of polymer looping, depending on the crowder size. We also examine how the crowding volume fraction, chain length, and the attraction strength of the contact groups of the polymer chain affect the looping kinetics and hairpin formation dynamics. Our results are relevant for DNA looping in the absence and presence of protein mediation, DNA hairpin formation, RNA folding, and the folding of polypeptide chains under biologically relevant high-crowding conditions.

However, fast and accurate identifying cutting boundary to separate teeth from dental model still remains a challenge, due to various geometrical shapes of teeth, complex tooth arrangements, different dental model qualities, and varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding</b> problems. Most segmentation approaches presented before {{are not able to}} achieve a balance between fine segmentation results and simple operating procedures with less time consumption. In this article, we present a novel, effective and efficient framework that achieves tooth segmentation based on a segmentation field, which is solved by a linear system defined by a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A set of contour lines are sampled from the smooth scalar field, and candidate cutting boundaries can be detected from concave regions with large variations of field data. The sensitivity to concave seams of the segmentation field facilitates effective tooth partition, as well as avoids obtaining appropriate curvature threshold value, which is unreliable in some case.

In this work, fluorescence electronic energy migration/ transfer is applied to measure intramolecular distances in two types of systems and under various conditions. The {{main part of the}} thesis utilizes the process of donor-acceptor energy transfer to probe distances within the ribosomal protein S 16. Proteins are essential to all organisms. Therefore, it is of great interest to study protein structure and function in order to understand and prevent protein malfunction. Moreover, {{it is also important to}} try to study the proteins in an environment which resembles its natural habitat. Here two protein homologs were investigated; S 16 Thermo and S 16 Meso, isolated from a hyperthemophilic bacterium and a mesophilic bacterium, respectively. It was concluded that the chemically induced unfolded state ensemble of S 16 Thermo is more compact than the corresponding ensemble of S 16 Meso. This unfolded state compaction may be one reason for the increased thermal stability of S 16 Thermo as compared to S 16 Meso. The unfolded state of S 16 was also studied under highly crowded conditions, mimicking the environment found in cells. It appears that a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding,</b> induced by 200 mg/mL dextran 20, forces the unfolded state ensemble of S 16 Thermo to become even more compact. Further, intramolecular distances in the folded state of five S 16 mutants were investigated upon increasing amounts of dextran 20. We found that the probed distances in S 16 Thermo are unaffected by increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding.</b> However, S 16 Meso shows decreasing intramolecular distances for all three studied variants, up to 100 mg/mL dextran. At higher concentrations, the change in distance becomes anisotropic. This suggests that marginally stable proteins like s 16 Meso may respond to macromolecular crowding by fine-tuning its structure. More stable proteins like S 16 Thermo however, show no structural change upon increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding.</b> We also investigated the possibility of local specific interactions between the protein and crowding agent, by means of fluorescence quenching experiments. Upon increasing amounts of a tyrosine labelled dextran, a diverse pattern of fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime suggests that specific, local protein-crowder interactions may occur. In a second studied system, electronic energy migration between two donor-groups, separated by a rigid steroid, was studied by two-photon excitation depolarization experiments. Data were analysed by using recent advances, based on the extended Förster theory, which yield a reasonable value of the distance between the two interacting donor-groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of energy migration data, obtained from two-photon excited fluorescence. ...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{examine the}} {{recoverability}} and completeness {{limits of the}} dense core mass functions (CMFs) derived for a molecular cloud using extinction data and a core identification scheme based on two-dimensional thresholding. Methods: We performed simulations where a population of artificial cores was embedded into the variable background extinction field of the Pipe nebula. We extracted the cores from the simulated extinction maps, constructed the CMFs, and compared them to the input CMFs. The simulations were repeated {{using a variety of}} extraction parameters and several core populations with differing input mass functions and differing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowding.</b> Results: The fidelity of the observed CMF depends on the parameters selected for the core extraction algorithm for our background. More importantly, it depends on how crowded the core population is. We find that the observed CMF recovers the true CMF reliably when the mean separation of cores is larger than their mean diameter (f> 1). If this condition holds, the derived CMF is accurate and complete above M > 0. 8 - 1. 5 Msun, depending on the parameters used for the core extraction. In the simulations, the best fidelity was achieved with the detection threshold of 1 or 2 times the rms-noise of the extinction data, and with the contour level spacings of 3 times the rms-noise. Choosing larger threshold and wider level spacings increases the limiting mass. The simulations show that when f> 1. 5, the masses of individual cores are recovered with a typical uncertainty of 25 - 30 %. When f= 1 the uncertainty is ~ 60 %. In very crowded cases where f< 1 the core identification algorithm is unable to recover the masses of the cores adequately. For the cores of the Pipe nebula f~ 2. 0 and therefore the use of the method in that region is justified. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R

I show that market based q and investment are increased, even though such investment is not warranted on the basis of long run value maximization. I use a simple episode to test the hypothesis that investment reacts to over-pricing. With publicly available data on short sales during the 1920 's, I examine both the price reaction and the investment behavior of a number of companies that were introduced into the "loan crowd" {{during the first half of}} 1926. In line with Jones and Lamont (2002), I interpret this as evidence of overpricing due to speculation. I find that investment by these companies follows both the increase and the decline in "q" before and after the introduction, suggesting that companies in this sample reacted to security over-pricing. In the next chapter of the thesis (co-authored with E. Farhi) we study optimal consumption and portfolio choice in a framework where investors save for early retirement. We assume that agents can adjust their labor supply only through an irreversible choice of their retirement time. We obtain closed form solutions and analyze the joint behavior of retirement time, portfolio choice, and consumption. In the final chapter of the thesis (co-authored with R.

Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, 18 kDa) or a larger fusion protein, NusA-DHFR (72 kDa), binds reversibly but with high affinity to a methotrexate-modified lipid (MTX-PE) incorporated into large unilamellar vesicles. Incorporation of phosphatidylethanolamine-PEG 5000 into the vesicles strongly decreases the affinity of binding of both proteins, {{to a degree that}} varies roughly exponentially with the lateral density of the PEG chains. Covalently coupling maltose-binding protein (MBP) to the vesicle surfaces also strongly decreases the affinity of binding of NusDHFR or DHFR, to a degree that likewise varies roughly exponentially with the surface density of anchored MBP. Surface-coupled MBP strongly decreases the rate of binding of NusDHFR to MTX-PE-incorporating vesicles but does not affect the rate of NusDHFR dissociation. The large magnitudes of these effects (easily exceeding an order of magnitude for moderate <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>crowding)</b> support previous theoretical analyses and suggest that surface-crowding effects can markedly influence a variety of important aspects of protein behavior in membranes...|$|R
