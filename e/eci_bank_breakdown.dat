40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Economia. Codi: EC 1049. Curs: 2015 / 2016 In this paper, {{we present}} an agent based {{model of the}} banking system, {{including}} banks households and a central bank. The model is able to address some relevant economic issues regarding liquidity shocks, shocks on assets, inequality wealth distributions and herding effects. By analyzing the effects that different policy configurations have on the system, we show that capital requirements are more effective than cash reserve restrictions in order to guarantee the robustness of the banking system. However, in case of high economic instability, liquidity requirements become ineffective. Also, we find that when the central bank is acting as a lender of last resource, capital requirement regulation becomes irrelevant, or even negative for economic growth. We also show that inequality among households wealth has a negative effect in both stability and growth. Finally, the model confirms that panic and herding among households accelerates the <b>banking</b> system <b>breakdown...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing {{detailed}} ownership {{data for}} {{a sample of}} European commercial banks, we analyze the link between ownership structure and risk in both privately owned and publicly held banks. We consider five categories of shareholders (managers/directors, institutional investors, non-financial companies, individuals/families, and <b>banks),</b> a <b>breakdown</b> specific to our dataset. Controlling for various factors, we find that ownership structure is significant in explaining risk differences but that such findings mainly hold for privately owned banks. On the whole, a higher equity stake of either individuals/families or banking institutions {{is associated with a}} decrease in asset risk and default risk. Also, institutional investors and non-financial companies seem to impose the riskiest strategies when they hold higher stakes. We further find no significant differences in asset risk and default risk between publicly-held and privately-owned banks. Moreover, for public banks, changes in ownership structure do not affect risk taking. Market forces seem to align the risk-taking behavior of public banks and the ownership structure is no more a determinant to explain risk differences. An exception is that higher stakes of banking institutions in public banks are associated with lower credit and default risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of {{personal data protection}} in the Czech Republic and in other developed countries has been continually increasing. A <b>bank's</b> security system <b>breakdown</b> can cause not only a misuse of the client's personal data but also a financial loss that harms the client and the bank reputation as well. The aim of the thesis is {{an analysis of the}} direct banking security and protection means of sensitive data of prime banks on the Czech market. First chapter characterises the consumer protection issues in regard of banking. The second part of the thesis concentrates on the area of direct banking, its forms, possible threats and the particular security tools used by local banks. Last section consists of an analysis of the survey among the banks and their clients...|$|R
40|$|Citizenship is {{increasingly}} investigated {{not just in}} terms of rights and duties, but as contentious, evolving and continuously forged anew. This article analyzes an Israeli High Court ruling from 2007 to show how a liberal, human rights-based discourse enabled effective citizenship within neocorporatist frameworks for those outside the formal political community. The ruling, which extended Israeli labor law to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West <b>Bank,</b> marks the <b>breakdown</b> of neocorporatism’s fundamental premise of congruence between labor force participation and participation in the political sphere, which engenders new opportunities for rejecting subjecthood and demanding inclusion. This marks a new development in the balance between the conflicting imperatives of economic inclusion and political exclusion in Israel’s relations with the Palestinians, and legitimizes practices of citizenship where formal political space is denied. It is not yet the ‘de-nationalizing’ of the state, but may be a step in decoupling effective citizenship from national belongin...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{theoretically}} {{the implications}} of bank market structure and banking system risks concentration for the functioning of interbank markets. It employs a simple model where banks are exposed to both credit and liquidity risk, there is no asymmetric information, no market power, no friction in secondary markets and deposit contracts are fully contingent. We show that (a) the concentration of risks induced by changes in bank market structure makes interbank market breakdowns more likely; (b) welfare monotonically decreases in risk concentration; and (c) risk concentration and a high probability of interbank market breakdowns can be driven by risk control diseconomies of scale and scope and increases in financial firms’ size. As banking systems become more concentrated, improvement of risk control technologies in financial institutions and in regulatory bodies appear as important as other policies considered in the literature to minimize the probability of interbank market <b>breakdowns.</b> <b>bank</b> market structure; systemic risk; interbank markets...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the poor {{performance}} of the U. S. banking industry in the 1980 s was due mainly to the risk-taking of the largest banks, which was encouraged by the U. S. government's too-big-to-fail policy. The article documents the recent trend toward riskier bank portfolios and the corresponding decline in <b>bank</b> profitability. A <b>breakdown</b> of the data by location and by asset size reveals that bank problems were concentrated in areas with troubled industries (oil, real estate, and agriculture) and among banks with the largest assets. In a statistical study controlling for location, asset size remains {{a significant factor in}} bank performance. The article concludes with a rough quantitative estimate of the cost to the industry of the poor performance of large banks.; The article is an abbreviated version of a paper published by MIT Press in the NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1993.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of short circuit tests recently conducted on PFMA 1 [1], a 150 kJ Mather-type Plasma Focus [2] designed to run at a repetition rate of 1 Hz for two hours at a time. PFMA 1 is operated at 30 kV, with a 350 mu F capacitor bank of 32 parallel capacitors. It is equipped with a custom designed fast high-voltage capacitive probe, a Rogowski coil [3] to monitor the total current flowing from the capacitor <b>bank,</b> and a <b>breakdown</b> time jitter analyzer. The short-circuit tests are conducted at 12 divided by 13 kV. Snowplow-type 2 D simulations [4] predict a peak of approximately 1. 5 MA for the total current at a filling pressure of 10 Torr of deuterium. In this work a description of PFMA 1 will be given, together with analytical computations of the inductance of the device; these computations will be compared with the results from a 2 D finite element model in cylindrical symmetry. A full description of the electrical diagnostics used in the experiments will be provided. Experimental results will be presented and discussed, and will be compared with those obtained theoretically. Agreement is found to be very good...|$|R
