40|$|The {{present study}} investigates what policy mixes {{are the most}} {{effective}} in fostering biotechnology innovations. An input-output approach has been used {{with a mix of}} biotechnology policy instruments at the input side and biotechnology performance in science and commercialisation at the output side. Policy mixes that include both generic and biotech-specific policy instruments which support both the science base and commercialisation activities correlate with higher performance levels. Countries that ascribe limited importance to the creation of generic and biotech-specific instruments for the stimulation of biotechnology also perform more weakly. Only generic research stimulating <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> is less effective; biotech-specific instruments seem to be more beneficial.

5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{approaches}} to playing without a shoulder rest. The {{first is to}} hold the violin horizontal {{with the support of}} the left hand at all times. This usually decreases the mobility of the thumb during downshifts and requires the thumb never to leave the neck of the violin in order to support the instrument. The second approach is to support the instrument almost fully at the neck-shoulder region, often requiring the use of some form of padding beside the collar bone to bring the violin closer to the jaw and to hold the <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> Some violinists may even raise their shoulder to achieve this, particularly when shifting positions and when using vibrato. Problems frequently surface while doing this, such as constant muscle tension which obstructs fluidity of technique, and may lead to injury in the long term. These problems can also arise from incorrect usage of shoulder rests.|$|E

On the base of benchmarking innovation performance of the Bulgarian economy using the European innovation scoreboard data the paper identifies main challenges to the national innovation policy. Among them are: to foster the overall R&D funding base; to initiate a recovery of R&D in the business enterprise sector; to strengthen the human resource base; to enhance the interactions between the actors of the science, technology and innovation system. In this respect the following questions, concerning innovation policy mix are discussed: What are the main objectives and priorities of R&D policy in the country? Is there {{a gap between the}} challenges and the main objectives and priorities? Which policy <b>instruments</b> are <b>in</b> <b>place</b> today aiming at affecting R&D activities in the private and in the public sector?

How does the governance of the system of R&D policy instruments take place, and is there a form of co-ordination between R&D policy and policy instruments from outside the R&D domain?

40|$|Albania is {{a country}} in the Southeastern of Europe that has gone through many {{obstacles}} since its independence (1912) until {{the fall of communism}} regime or “the dictatorship of the proletariat ” in 1991. After the fall of communism regime and the change of economy from a centralized one to an open economy, Albania is structuring its legal framework, institutions and agencies, policies, etc., in order {{to be a member of}} European Union. Due to its undertaken reforms and required ones from European Union, Albania is in a crossroad regarding the policies and institutional bodies of regional development. One of the latest reforms recently presented and approved in the Albanian Parliament is the new Territorial Reform, which has defined a new organization of the local government. Such reform has not yet been accompanied with a legal revision of respective existing laws. In this context, the lack of a legal framework which would define the roles and responsibilities of the local and government structures, makes things more difficult. Even though there is a financial <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> such as Regional Development Fund to eliminate disparities between regions, it is often object of mutual debate of the government and opposition because of the way of funding the projects. This paper tries to review the role of central and local/regional government in Albania with regards to regional development. Firstly, I will present the context of legal and institutional framework of the local and central government. Afterwards, I will try to explain the policy and financial framework of the regional development in Albania.

Although not only governance arrangements determine policy <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and their opportunities and challenges towards the achievement of targets, also normative values play a role. This becomes more relevant as more actors mention the own responsibility of citizens regarding energy efficiency in buildings. Actors from the state, market and civil society located in the Northern Netherlands, simulate primarily homeowners, facilitating initiatives. Communicative instruments are perceived to have most opportunities achieving targets. Financial instruments, on the other hand, have a too short timeframe and too different preconditions therewith perceived as less effective achieving targets.
