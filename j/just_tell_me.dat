25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{she was a}} {{supporting}} actress in Airport 1975. Loy played Mrs. Devane, a heavy-drinking woman, imbibing Jim Beam and Olympia Beer mixed together. She played a foil to Sid Caesar. The film also starred Gloria Swanson. In 1978, she appeared in the film The End {{as the mother of}} the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> What You Want. She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E

25|$|While {{directing}} The Outlaw, Hughes became {{fixated on}} a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty {{of dealing with the}} tycoon. In his book, <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film three stars out of four, {{describing}} the revelation {{at the end}} a [...] "fundamental flaw" [...] and a [...] "cheat." [...] He wrote, [...] "The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two." [...] R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, [...] "I love a good science fiction story; <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> in advance." [...] He gave the film a B-. Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was [...] "'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'" ...|$|E
