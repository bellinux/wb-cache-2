50|$|A <b>dripstick</b> {{is a thin}} hollow tube {{installed}} vertically in {{the bottoms}} of fuel tanks of many large aircraft, used to check fuel levels. To read a <b>dripstick,</b> it is withdrawn from the lower surface of the wing. When {{the top of the}} <b>dripstick</b> is withdrawn below the level of the fuel, fuel enters the <b>dripstick</b> and drips {{through a hole in the}} cap. Graduations on the <b>dripstick</b> indicate the level of the fuel in the tank.|$|E
