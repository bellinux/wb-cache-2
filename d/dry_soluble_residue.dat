The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect over 6 years of organic (OR) and conventional (CO) field trials on 16 different genotipes of cauliflower, employing crop rotation. Yield of production and quality-nutraceuticals characteristic (<b>dry</b> matter, <b>soluble</b> solid <b>residue,</b> pH, titratable acidity, vitamin C, total polyphenols index, thiols content, antioxidant potential and main volatiles) were determined. Yield and florets weights gave {{a significant decrease in}} OR (about 25 % on total average) respect to CO. The differences in DM, Soluble Solids, pH and total acidity between each OR and CO genotipes were negligible, don’t showing a quality loss in OR-grown cauliflowers. The vit C content was higher (16 % on total average) in OR respect to CO. The total polyphenol index and the thiols content resulted slightly higher in OR, hence the difference resulted not significant with CO fields. The antioxidant profile showed high indexes in OR-grown cauliflowers, but the differences with CO resulted not significant. As regards the volatile amounts, the total average difference between OR and CO resulted not significant, with a difference for the single samplings: 4 resulted higher in CO and 2 resulted higher in OR-grown plants.

40|$|An {{external}} recirculation loop {{was used}} as the method of increasing the concentration of <b>dry</b> <b>soluble</b> substances in the obtained extract. The objective of the research is to determine the value of the external recirculation index (KR), which provides the optimal conditions for the process carrying out. The results of the conducted research show the increase in the concentration of <b>dry</b> <b>soluble</b> substances in the extract if the external recirculation index increases. It is conditioned by the extension of the interaction between the processed raw mate-rial and the extract, {{as well as by the}} decrease in the surface tension of the extracting agent, which results in improving the conditions of its penetration into the pores of particles. Such an opposite property of recirculation as the decrease in mass transfer rate was also ob-served. It causes the significant rise of <b>dry</b> <b>soluble</b> substances losses while discharging extraction cake, which leads to the performance degradation. According to the analytical evaluation of the obtained results, the maximum process results are observed if KR = 1 (without recirculation) and KR = 2, the values of the optimality criterion are 5. 02 ∙ 10 - 3 and 4. 92 ∙ 10 - 3 % mass/W respectively. At the same time the operation of the apparatus with the recirculation loop at KR = 2 is characterized by 62 %-increase in <b>dry</b> <b>soluble</b> substances concentration in the extract as compared to a pure extracting agent. The efficiency of recirculation at KR = 2 is proved by the saving of energy con-sumed on the evaporation of the extract obtained.

Texture of material moves from elastic-visco-plastic to rigid, becoming fragile and brittle. These changes are welcomed when the final product is a crispy and crunchy snack food. The aim of this work is to define the combined process, involving the osmodehydration and air-drying techniques, in order to obtain dried and crispy pineapple rings, having high qualitative characteristics. Six mm thick pineapple rings were osmodehydrated for 30 minutes in pineapple juice and sucrose solution, both at 50 °Bx. Not pre-treated and pre-osmodehydrated rings were air dried at 70 - 75 - 80 °C till constant weight. <b>Dry</b> matter, <b>soluble</b> refractometric <b>residue,</b> pH and titratable acidity of raw and osmodehydrated samples were measured. Solid gain and water loss of the osmotic process were assessed. Dry matter and water activity of dried product were also measured. Changes of colour and surface area due to processing were evaluated by image analysis technique. Final product crispness was determined by bending snapping test. The sensorial characteristics were judged by a panel test. From both instrumental and sensorial aspects air-dehydrated samples resulted crispier than the respective osmo-airdehydrated ones regardless of solution type and temperature. This behaviour could be linked to the higher residual water content of the osmo-airdehydrated pineapple rings. The higher the drying temperature the better the results for instrumental and sensorial crispness. As expected the colour was negatively influenced with the increase in drying temperature. The osmotic pre-treatment in sucrose solution protected the colour during drying but the osmo-dehydration with pineapple juice hadn’t the same positive influence. The best result was obtained with not pre-treated pineapple rings dried at 75 °C: the product was slightly amber- coloured, crispy and not hard and consequently appreciated by the tasters...|$|R

40|$|Distillers grains are co-products {{produced}} from the fermentation of grains for alcohol. Traditionally, alcohol was produced mainly for the beverage liquor industry, {{but in the}} last 20 years its use as an alternative fuel has increased significantly. This increased demand has {{led to the development of}} several ethanol production plants in Minnesota and the surrounding area. In 1996, it is estimated 135, 000 tons of distillers grains will be {{produced from}} current plants with production doubling or tripling over the next five years as more ethanol plants begin operation. Thus, the opportunity exists for using a substantial quantity of distillers grains in dairy rations. When grains are fermented to alcohol, approximately one-third of the dry matter (DM) is recovered in co-products. The two basic products at the end of the fermentation process are coarse, unfermented grains and a liquid fraction known as thin stillage containing small particles of grain, yeast and soluble nutrients.

The quality of fermented products during the two trial years was defined by the content of dry matter of 6, 00 - 6, 98 %, <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> matter of 4, 97 - 5, 70 %, lactic acid of 0, 88 - 1, 26 %, pH-value of 3, 62 - 4, 18, L-ascorbic acid of 63, 81 - 213, 23 mg/ 100 g dry matter and NaCl of 1, 53 - 2, 56 %. No significant differences between fresh cabbage cultivars were determined by the analysis of variance in the contents of <b>dry</b> matter, <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> matter, % of lactic acid, pH value, % of NaCl and L-ascorbic acid. In the first research year, significant differences between cultivars were determined in the content of L- ascorbic acid and the pH value. In the second research year, significant differences were determined in the content of L- ascorbic acid between 60 and 90 days of fermentation. The results indicate that the cultivar ´Varaždinski´ can be replaced in the Ogulin region by the studied hybrid cultivars...|$|R

40|$|The organic {{pollutants}} (OPs) present in compostable organic residues can be recovered {{in the final}} composts leading to environmental impacts related to their use in agriculture. However, the composting process may contribute to their partial dissipation that is classically evaluated through the concentration decrease in extractable OPs, without identification of the responsible mechanisms as mineralization or stabilization of OP as non-extractable residues (NER) or bound residues. The dissipation of four 14 C-labeled OPs (fluoranthene; 4 -n-nonylphenol, NP; sodium linear dodecylbenzene sulfonate, LAS; glyphosate) was assessed during composting of sewage sludge and green waste. The dissipation of LAS largely resulted from its mineralization (51 % of initial LAS), whereas mineralization was intermediate for NP (29 %) and glyphosate (24 %), and negligible for fluoranthene. The NER pathway mostly concerned NP and glyphosate, with 45 % and 37 % of the recovered 14 C being found as NER {{at the end of}} composting, respectively. In the final composts, the proportions of water <b>soluble</b> <b>residues</b> of OPs considered as readily available were < 11 % of recovered 14 C-OPs. However, most fluoranthene remained solvent extractable (72 %) and potentially available, whereas only 18 % of glyphosate and less than 7 % of both NP and LAS remained solvent extractable in the final compost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{determinations}} had as purpose {{establishing the}} quality of fruits at nine cultivars of bell pepper and kapia pepper from cultures {{set up in the}} field through seedling. The pepper is a solano-fruitful vegetable that is grown for its fruits mainly rich in ascorbic acid and which can be consumed both in fresh and canned state, under different forms. Establishing {{the quality of}} fruits was made through determining the physical characteristics (specific weight, average weight, form – expressed by the form index), chemical composition (total <b>dry</b> substance, humidity, <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> substance, titrable acidity, ascorbic acid) and technological characteristics (proportion of the eatable part, the thickness of pericarp). The biological material used was represented by inland and foreig...|$|R
40|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Texas Transportation Institute’s (TTI) Environmental Management Program {{work with}} TxDOT Districts to develop {{roadside}} management practices that mitigate the highway right-of-way environment and promote healthier, more rapid plant establishment. This research study compared {{the effects of}} different root-zone soil amendments on tree establishment and growth within the highway right-of-way environment. The demonstration project site was selected {{at the intersection of}} Interstate Highway (IH) 27 at Business IH 27 in Plainview, Texas. The funding for the project was from TxDOT’s Construction Landscape Program with a design budget of $ 185, 000. Project installation was in the spring of 1996. Results show {{that the majority of the}} trees receiving the treatment consisting of mycorrhizal inoculation, acrylamide copolymer, <b>dry</b> <b>soluble</b> yucca plant extract, soluble sea kelp extract, and humic acid had a positive response compared to the control groups and other treatment types. However, the treatment types are species specific in their overall effectiveness. Further research addressing the issues of a larger sampling of trees, more effective identification methods, and a concerted maintenance program for the demonstration site should be examined prior to making any recommendations for field application...|$|R
40|$|The {{fermentation}} of grains {{to produce}} alcohol yields whole spent stillage from which wet distillers grains (WDG) and thin stillage are obtained by screening and pressing or centrifugation. Usually, WDG are dried to yield {{dried distillers grains}} (DDG), or dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) if solubles in the thin stillage are added back to the grains at <b>drying.</b> The <b>solubles</b> in the thin stillage may also be partially or totally dried to make condensed distillers <b>solubles</b> (CDS) or <b>dried</b> distillers <b>solubles</b> (DDS), respectively. Of these co-products, DDG and DDGS are the most commonly used, probably because of ease of handling, storage, and shipping. However, {{the high cost of}} drying has led people to investigate the possibility of feeding wet distillers byproducts to ruminants. NUTRIENT COMPOSITION Table 1 shows the chemical composition of distillers grains co-products from various grains. These products are generally characterized by higher protein, fat, NDF and ash, and lower starch contents compared with the source grain. Distillers dried grains and DDGS contain moderate levels of protein, and high levels of fat and fiber, which makes them attractive for use in ruminant diets. However, like many other byproduct feeds, the nutrient content in distiller...|$|R
