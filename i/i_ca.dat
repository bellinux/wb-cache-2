Two quantitative variants of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> that are ideal for studies of enzyme regulation exist in this species.

The other is a deficiency variant of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> which, in homozygotes, reduces the product of the <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> locus about 5000 -fold and reduces the product of the CA II locus by about 60 %. -[14 C]Serine was used to study the biosynthesis of <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> and <b>CA</b> II isozymes in the reticulocytes of animals carrying these <b>CA</b> <b>I</b> variants. Specific radioactivity and total incorporation data from bone marrow erythroid cells, and peripheral blood reticulocytes indicate that the reduced CA Ia concentration is probably the result of degradation.

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca <b>I,</b> <b>Ca</b> II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} the intracellular calcium (<b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +)) transient to acetylcholine (ACh) -mediated reduction of pacemaker frequency and cAMP content in rabbit sinoatrial nodal (SAN) cells. Action potentials (whole cell perforated patch clamp) and <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transients (Indo- 1 fluorescence) were recorded from single isolated rabbit SAN cells, whereas intracellular cAMP content was measured in SAN cell suspensions using a cAMP assay (LANCE((R))). Our data show that the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient, like the hyperpolarization-activated "funny current" (I (f)) and the ACh-sensitive potassium current (I (K,ACh)), is an important determinant of ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. When I (f) and I (K,ACh) were both inhibited, by cesium (2 mM) and tertiapin (100 nM), respectively, 1 micro M ACh was still able to reduce pacemaker frequency by 72 %. In these I (f) and I (K,ACh) -inhibited SAN cells, good correlations were found between the ACh-mediated change in interbeat interval and the ACh-mediated change in <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient decay (r (2) = 0. 98) and slow diastolic <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) rise (r (2) = 0. 73). Inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (5 microM) facilitated ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. Furthermore, ACh depressed the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient and reduced the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2 +) content, all in a concentration-dependent fashion. At 1 microM ACh, the spontaneous activity and <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient were abolished, but completely recovered when cAMP production was stimulated by forskolin (10 microM) and I (K,ACh) was inhibited by tertiapin (100 nM). Also, inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (25 microM) exaggerated the ACh-mediated inhibition of cAMP content, indicating that <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) affects cAMP production in SAN cells. In conclusion, muscarinic receptor stimulation inhibits the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient via a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. Inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient contributes to pacemaker slowing and inhibits <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) -stimulated cAMP production. Thus, we provide functional evidence for {{the contribution of the}} <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient to ACh-induced inhibition of pacemaker activity and cAMP content in rabbit SAN cell...|$|R
