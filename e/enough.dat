5|$|Around {{three-quarters of}} chicks live long <b>enough</b> to fledge, but {{not more than}} half of those survive long <b>enough</b> to reproduce. The maximum {{recorded}} age is 27 years and 5 months for a Dutch bird.|$|E
5|$|I {{do believe}} I've had <b>enough.</b>|$|E
5|$|In any case, {{there was}} not <b>enough</b> artillery, but new pieces could not be brought in. This was because it was very {{difficult}} to move them over land, and {{there was not}} <b>enough</b> ice to bring them over the sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must be large <b>enough</b> {{to cause the}} curve to move {{by at least one}} pixel even at points of low curvature, but small <b>enough</b> to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the size of a pixel must be , small <b>enough</b> to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E
5|$|Some ionic liquids, {{particularly}} with mixtures of anions or cations, can be cooled rapidly <b>enough</b> {{that there is}} not <b>enough</b> time for crystal nucleation to occur, so an ionic glass is formed (with no long-range order).|$|E
5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not <b>enough</b> TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not <b>enough</b> TSH and thereby to not <b>enough</b> thyroid hormone production.|$|E
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long <b>enough</b> to mate. Sexual selection is strong <b>enough</b> to allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive <b>enough</b> to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not <b>enough</b> to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive <b>enough</b> to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity is strong <b>enough</b> to keep gases {{close to the}} surface. The larger giant planets are massive <b>enough</b> to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere {{is different from the}} other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|August 27–29, 1951: The {{remnants}} of a tropical cyclone brought <b>enough</b> rain to wash out some roads in southern California.|$|E
5|$|Because the Iowas were fast <b>enough</b> {{to escort}} the new s, their orders were retained, making them the last US Navy battleships to be commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Before being mature <b>enough</b> to mate, {{females of}} P. labiata and also P. schultzi mimic adult females to attract males as prey.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful <b>enough</b> to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap <b>enough</b> for an arcade game would not be powerful <b>enough</b> to run <b>enough</b> games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E
5|$|By September24, {{it began}} to track northward away from the islands, and {{developed}} <b>enough</b> strong thunderstorm activity near its center and a well-defined <b>enough</b> circulation to be deemed a tropical storm on September25. It strengthened to a hurricane on September27 west of Bermuda. It made landfall in Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane late on September 28, then became extratropical shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Megh made {{landfall}} on the Yemen mainland, it had weakened <b>enough</b> to not produce any strong winds or heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{losing the}} Tough <b>Enough</b> contest, Mizanin had piqued the {{interest}} of WWE, and he was eventually offered a developmental contract.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British training, the SLA was {{not large}} <b>enough</b> or strong <b>enough</b> {{to enter into}} combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the {{advancing}} SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.|$|E
5|$|Dynamical: {{the object}} is large <b>enough</b> to cause all other objects to {{eventually}} leave its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close <b>enough</b> {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm <b>enough</b> to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold <b>enough</b> for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Every {{species is}} fertile <b>enough</b> {{that if all}} {{offspring}} survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).|$|E
5|$|However, the {{observed}} 4.7 gigawatts heat flux is <b>enough</b> {{to power the}} cryovolcanism without the presence of ammonia.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having <b>enough</b> money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company {{would not have had}} <b>enough</b> money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the {{following}} five drivers failed {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 because they could not finish high <b>enough</b> in their respective Duels or turn a fast <b>enough</b> qualifying lap: Casey Mears, Todd Bodine, Derrike Cope, Kevin Conway, and Michael McDowell. The second race had a record-breaking total of 22 lead changes in the Gatorade Duels among seven different drivers and had five caution periods. Burton's total of 17 laps led was the highest of any competitor.|$|E
5|$|It must {{retain the}} gas well <b>enough</b> to stay aloft for 30days.|$|E
5|$|Lita {{served as}} a trainer on the sixth season of Tough <b>Enough,</b> {{alongside}} Booker T and Billy Gunn. She appeared on the July 13, 2015 episode of Raw to introduce the Tough <b>Enough</b> contestants. In October of that year, {{it was announced that}} Dumas had become a creative writer for the WWE on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Low budgets, generally: Taken and Paul Blarts stars, Liam Neeson and Kevin James respectively, are not {{considered}} A-listers, bankable <b>enough</b> to open a major movie {{on the strength of}} their names alone. Therefore, Meslow writes, they work for lower salaries, which helps keep budgets low <b>enough</b> for the film to be profitable with a smaller potential audience amid minimal competition.|$|E
5|$|Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland was {{selected}} by Sinn Féin, and received <b>enough</b> support from independent TDs to be nominated.|$|E
5|$|Money No <b>Enough</b> was {{produced}} by JSP Films on a budget of S$850,000. The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director, J.P. Tan as producer, Kamis as cinematographer, A. Supranamian as film editor, Anthony Ng as art director and Abdul Shukar Mohd as sound designer. Filming was plagued by financial problems, such as poor quality shooting equipment. After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No <b>Enough,</b> distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008. The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and Producer over their shares of the profits. To mark its tenth anniversary, Money No <b>Enough</b> was released in cinemas again and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Money No <b>Enough</b> 2.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has <b>enough</b> to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, {{the job of a}} manager has become more complex. A player–manager needs to decide how much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself <b>enough.</b> Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player–manager.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that <b>enough</b> electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high <b>enough</b> price to pay for its construction.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries, if <b>enough</b> moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active <b>enough</b> just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E
5|$|Results in {{the other}} groups meant that a second-place finish was <b>enough</b> for United to {{progress}} into the quarter-finals, joining group leaders Bayern Munich.|$|E
5|$|Robert Penn Warren's World <b>Enough</b> and Time {{was also}} {{inspired}} by them.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is <b>enough</b> to pump protons and generate ATP, but not <b>enough</b> to produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce <b>enough</b> proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
