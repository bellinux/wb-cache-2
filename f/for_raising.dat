At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck.

5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} <b>for</b> <b>raising</b> political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E

5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible <b>for</b> <b>raising</b> funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E

In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises are {{not very}} widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much {{like the rest of}} the odontocetes.

Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>raising</b> them. Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the harbour porpoise, are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.|$|E

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies of vocal attractiveness have focused on preferences for physical characteristics of voices such as pitch. Here we examine the content of vocalizations in interaction with such physical traits, finding that vocal cues of social interest modulate the strength of men's preferences <b>for</b> <b>raised</b> pitch in women's voices. Men showed stronger preferences <b>for</b> <b>raised</b> pitch when judging the voices of women who appeared interested in the listener than when judging the voices of women who appeared relatively disinterested in the listener. These findings show that voice preferences are not determined solely by physical properties of voices and that men integrate information about voice pitch {{and the degree of}} social interest expressed by women when forming voice preferences. Women's preferences <b>for</b> <b>raised</b> pitch in women's voices were not modulated by cues of social interest, suggesting that the integration of cues of social interest and voice pitch when men judge the attractiveness of women's voices may reflect adaptations that promote efficient allocation of men's mating effort. © 2008 The Royal Society...|$|R
