40|$|Use of {{antipsychotic}} medication <b>during</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>course</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy {{in patients}} suffering from schizophrenia is frequently necessary as discontinuation of therapy {{can lead to}} relapse of the illness which can be far more severe for the mother, {{but also for the}} fetus. That is the case why third generation antipsychotics, so called atypical antipsychotics, are also being used <b>during</b> <b>the</b> pregnancy, but their effects are not fully researched. Use of ziprasidone as a third generation antipsychotic, and its effects <b>during</b> <b>the</b> pregnancy in patients suffering from various mental illnesses is very rarely described in scientific literature. There is even fewer information regarding eventual adverse events of ziprasidone in newborn babies of mothers that have been treated with ziprasidone <b>during</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>course</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy. This paper will be based around a case report of a female patient suffering from schizophrenia who has been treated with ziprasidone <b>during</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>course</b> <b>of</b> her pregnancy and whose newborn baby was diagnosed with a cleft palate (palatoschisis) at the time of birth...|$|R

According to the data collected from our patients, presence of peritoneal fluid, fever higher than 38 ºC and adolescent age can be risk factors for development of pleural effusions. If intractable fluid collections resist to multiple thoracentesis then tube thoracostomy may be needed for the treatment...|$|R
