In February 1976, the New Scientist magazine, in discussing issues of chicken <b>egg</b> <b>color,</b> stated [...] "Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs, preferring even {{to pay more for}} brown eggs although white eggs are just as good". As a result of these trends, brown eggs are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered 'normal', due to lower production. In France and the United Kingdom, {{it is very difficult to}} buy white eggs, with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular brown eggs.

5000|$|Although <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> is {{a largely}} {{cosmetic}} issue, with {{no effect on}} egg quality or taste, {{it is a major}} issue in production due to regional and national preferences for specific colors, and the results of such preferences on demand.

50|$|The {{breeding}} behaviour {{of this species}} has not been extensively documented but {{it is thought that}} the species breeds in July/August usually after flooding or heavy rain. Hardy (2002) however recorded breeding during heavy drought with no local surface water in the study area for at least seven years. The semi-domed nest is built in lignum or cane grass, between 30 and 75 cm above ground level. Favaloro and McEvey (1968) noted that the nest was a large well camouflaged nest, very loosely constructed from grass with a large opening on the side. Clutch size is thought to be two eggs with an average weight of 2.4 g. <b>Egg</b> <b>color</b> is dull, white speckled all over with nutmeg brown, nutmeg to reddish-brown or cinnamon brown markings. There is considerable colour variation between eggs within the nest and also between nests.The female is solely responsible for the incubation of the eggs which is estimated at 13 to 15 days. Both parents attend to the feeding of the hatchlings and no details are known of its breeding success. The Malurie family is known to include species such as the white-throated grasswren (Amytornis woodwardi) thick-billed grasswren (Amytornis purnelli) that use cooperative breeding to improve reproductive success. However, research conducted on the striated grasswren (Amytornis striatus) suggests that this species is socially monogamous with low levels of cooperative breeding. Further research is required to understand further aspects of its social and breeding characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A recent {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} birds ’ blue-green egg colors {{may be a}} sexually selected signal of female (and potentially nestling) quality that males use to make parental investment decisions. While there is some empirical support for this idea, both theory and observa-tions question its validity. To test this hypothesis experi-mentally, we examined the influence of <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> on male American robin Turdus migratorius behavior by replacing natural clutches with four artificial eggs that were all either pale or vividly colored, close to the extremes in natural egg coloration. At {{the end of the}} incubation period, three unrelated nestlings were fostered into each experimental nest, and parental provisioning behavior was monitored when nestlings were 3, 6, and 9 days old. Male provision-ing rate for 3 -day-old nestlings was significantly higher in the vivid egg treatment compared to both the pale egg treatment and untreated controls, but there was no effect of <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> on paternal behavior at the older nestling stages. Male feeding rate at unmanipulated nests was only weakly positively related to natural <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> (chroma) when nestlings were 3 days old. These results suggest that blue-green <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> may act as a post-mating signal of female quality or investment in this species, but our findings do not exclude the possibility that <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> pigmentation also serves other adaptive functions...|$|E
40|$|Avian brood parasites {{lay their}} eggs in the nests of other birds, and impose the costs associ-ated with rearing {{parasitic}} young onto these hosts. Many hosts of brood parasites defend against parasitism by removing foreign eggs from the nest. In systems where parasitic eggs mimic host eggs in coloration and patterning, extensive intraclutch variation in egg appear-ances may impair the host’s ability to recognize and reject parasitic eggs, but experimental investigation of this effect has produced conflicting results. The cognitive mechanism by which hosts recognize parasitic eggs may vary across brood parasite hosts, and this may explain variation in experimental outcome across studies investigating egg rejection in hosts of egg-mimicking brood parasites. In contrast, for hosts of non-egg-mimetic parasites, intraclutch <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> variation is not predicted to co-vary with foreign egg rejection, irrespec-tive of cognitive mechanism.

A model was based on determining <b>egg</b> shell <b>color</b> for 420 <b>eggs.</b> Shell <b>color</b> of <b>eggs</b> obtained in aviaries is very versatile and can be expressed in almost 25 color tones. All these nuances are embedded in the seven basic tones. The result shows that embryonic death rate is 85 % for lime skim eggs, 50 % for lime spots eggs, 50 % for green eggs, 30 % for blue-green eggs, 25 % for dark grey eggs, 25 % for brown eggs and 20 % for light brown eggs. Results of this study were applied to one of the biggest pheasant farm in Serbia, “Ristovača” in Bač. The total number of examined eggs was 216, 188 of which 191, 240 were fertilized, and 24, 948 had dead embryos. Thus the total number of hatched pheasant chicks was 155, 690. The eggs were classified by their color and related to their hatchability status.

40|$|Background: Antagonistic species often {{interact}} via matching of phenotypes, {{and interactions}} between brood parasitic common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and their hosts constitute classic examples. The {{outcome of a}} parasitic event is often determined by the match between host and cuckoo eggs, giving rise to potentially strong associations between fitness and egg phenotype. Yet, empirical efforts aiming to document and understand the resulting evolutionary outcomes are in short supply. Methods/Principal Findings: We used avian color space models to analyze patterns of <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> variation within and between the cuckoo and two closely related hosts, the nomadic brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) and the site fidelic chaffinch (F. coelebs). We found that there is pronounced opportunity for disruptive selection on brambling egg coloration. The corresponding cuckoo host race has evolved egg colors that maximize fitness in both sympatric and allopatric brambling populations. By contrast, the chaffinch has a more bimodal <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> distribution consistent with the evolutionary direction predicted for the brambling. Whereas the brambling and its cuckoo host race show little geographical variation in their <b>egg</b> <b>color</b> distributions, the chaffinch’s distribution becomes increasingly dissimilar to the brambling’s distribution towards the core area of the brambling cuckoo host race.
