5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
25|$|But then I confess, {{you have}} one reason that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> confute, — which is the {{contrary}} judgment of your neighbour ministers. They may see more than I can, (especially such as judicious and honest Mr. Fisher, who knoweth both places.) And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to advise you, but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E
25|$|The money {{expended}} {{by the two}} departments {{amounted to}} about four hundred thousand dollars each, the State appropriating that expended by the Commission, while the stockholders of the Corporation subscribed about an equal amount. The proceeds from the Exposition were expended entirely {{under the direction of}} the Corporation. The government of the United States appropriated $475,000 and about an equal value in exhibits, the exact amounts of which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> give.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{state with}} {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, {{but we could}} consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E

500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake." ...|$|E

I said <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> believe him. There is a difference.") [...] Harry Wu's quote, is anecdotal and its accuracy is suspect.

2500|$|Frankfurter again {{expressed}} his incredulity. [...] "...he most conscientious probing {{of the text}} and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football", he said. He was joined in a separate opinion by John Marshall Harlan II signed by then-new justice William Brennan: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself." ...|$|E

Vasily Avseenko, describing Pisemsky's visit to Saint Petersburg in 1869 after the publication of People of the Forties, recalled how old and tired he looked. [...] "I am beginning to feel like a victim of my own spleen," [...] Pisemsky confessed in an August 1875 letter to Annenkov. [...] "I am all right physically, but cannot say the same of my mental and moral state; hypochondria torments me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> write and any mental effort makes me feel sick. Thank God the religious feeling, which is now blossoming in me, gives some respite to my suffering soul," [...] Pisemsky wrote to Turgenev in the early 1870s.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 May 2011, it was {{announced}} that Minogue would not be returning for the eighth series of The X Factor UK.

For this reason <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return." [...] She was replaced by Kelly Rowland. In January 2012, Minogue appeared on the ITV documentary The Talent Show Story where she talked about her time on The X Factor and working on talent shows. Other The X Factor judges who were interviewed included Gary Barlow, Walsh, Tulisa, Rowland and Simon Cowell as well as the host Dermot O'Leary. In June 2013, Minogue joined Elle Macpherson and Tyson Beckford on the judging panel for the ninth series of Sky Living's Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model. She replaced Whitney Port and Julien McDonald.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 May 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Cowell and Cole {{would not be}} returning to the judging panel for series 8, to concentrate on the American version of the programme.

For this reason <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return.". After Cowell, Minogue and Cole announced their leave, a number of celebrities were linked with judging roles, including Frankie Sandford, Gary Barlow, Noel Gallagher, Nicole Scherzinger, Tulisa, Kelly Rowland and Alesha Dixon, though Dixon ruled herself out, due to her commitments with Strictly Come Dancing, she later joined Cowell's other show Britain's Got Talent. On 30 May, it {{was confirmed}} that Barlow, Rowland and Tulisa would join Walsh for series 8. On 29 and 30 October, Rowland was unable to travel back from Los Angeles as she had a throat infection, and was unable to judge the fourth week of the live shows, so series 5 winner Alexandra Burke took her place.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Owen was {{a social}} {{reformer}} and wealthy industrialist who made his fortune from textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Owen, his twenty-two-year-old son, William, and his Scottish friend Donald McDonald [...] sailed to the United States in 1824 to purchase a site to implement Owen's vision for [...] "a New Moral World" [...] of happiness, enlightenment, and prosperity through education, science, technology, and communal living. Owen believed his utopian community would create a [...] "superior social, intellectual and physical environment" [...] based on his ideals of social reform. Owen was motivated to buy the town {{in order to prove}} his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community New Lanark. The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fit Owen's needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited [...] "any and all" [...] to join him there. While many of the town's new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted [...] "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely." [...] William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March 24, 1825: [...] "I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when they come here.
