5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> {{several sources}} that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{is thought}} to have been {{conceived}} and commenced in about 1175 by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, who died in 1191. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> its size that from the outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese, the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of Glastonbury and Bath, before settling at Wells. In 1197 Bishop Reginald's successor, Bishop Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.|$|E

5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Hrvatske autoceste along the A3 motorway from January to August 2009 {{was reported to}} comprise the largest proportion of the total toll revenue {{collected by}} the company for the period: 889.8 millionkuna (approximately 121.9 millioneuro). Even though this figure is not further decomposed into the individual sections of motorway, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the traffic volume data analysis that the largest portion of the toll revenue is collected on the sections between Zagreb and Slavonski Brod, and especially on those sections closest to the Ivanja Reka interchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{statement}} {{he said he}} had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{synthesised}} and transmitted {{the learning}} from his predecessors, {{as well as}} made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating {{the age of the}} earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome's Vulgate, which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by Basil, Cassian, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville, Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, Pope Gregory I, Ambrose of Milan, Cassiodorus, and Cyprian. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works. He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius's Life of Antony, and a copy of Sulpicius Severus' Life of St. Martin. He also used lesser known writers, such as Fulgentius, Julian of Eclanum, Tyconius, and Prosper of Aquitaine. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.|$|E

25|$|First we {{prove the}} theorem for the 2-colour case, by {{induction}} on r+s. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the definition {{that for all}} n, R(n, 1) = R(1, n) = 1. This starts the induction. We prove that R(r, s) exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis R(r−1, s) and R(r, s−1) exist.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> {{the course}} of events that when the reports began to arrive about the actions of the Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken of these reports, the correct {{conclusions}} were not drawn from them, and no energetic and immediate action were taken to restrain the Phalangists and put a stop to their actions.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of Jews, perhaps more than 6000, found refuge in the various {{religious}} properties of Rome, including monasteries and convents; a much smaller number, took refuge in Vatican City itself. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the number of letters of protection issued by von Weizsäcker {{that many of the}} buildings possessing letters of protecting (and asserting extraterritorial status) were in fact not owned by the Church.|$|E
25|$|Many {{inscriptions}} {{consist of}} only a few words (often names) in rote phrases, and many are fragmentary.

25|$|The Jarmann rifle was {{a remarkably}} {{accurate}} rifle for its time. In 1886, the joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission, which had selected the Jarmann, created {{a list of}} the ballistic properties of all the rifles tested. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the list, reproduced below, that the Jarmann M1884 was significantly better than the other rifles tested, although in part this must be due to the higher muzzle velocity of the Jarmann.|$|E
25|$|On the fortress-world Jago, Lord-General Van Voytz {{addresses}} the Tanith First personally.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> {{this figure}} that early saurischians resembled early ornithischians, but not modern crocodiles. Saurischians are {{distinguished}} from the ornithischians by retaining the ancestral configuration of bones in the pelvis. Another difference is in the skull, the upper skull of the Ornithischia is more solid and the joint connecting the lower jaw is more flexible; both are adaptations to herbivory and both can already be seen in Lesothosaurus.|$|E
