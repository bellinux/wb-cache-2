40|$|Background. External {{impingement}} {{tests are}} considered as being particularly reliable for identifying subacromial and coracoid shoulder impingement mechanisms. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to evaluate if these tests are likely to provoke an internal shoulder impingement mechanism which, in cases of a pathologic condition, can lead to a positive test result. Method. In 37 subjects, the mechanical contact between the glenoid rim and the rotator cuff (RC) was measured quantitatively and qualitatively in external impingement test positions using an open MRI system. Results. Mechanical contact of the supraspinatus with the posterosuperior glenoid was present in 30 subjects in the Neer test. In the <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test,</b> the subscapularis was in contact with the anterosuperior glenoid in 33 subjects and the supraspinatus in 18. In the horizontal impingement test, anterosuperior contact of the supraspinatus with the glenoid was identified in 35 subjects. Conclusion. The Neer, Hawkins, and horizontal impingement tests are likely to provoke the mechanism of an internal shoulder impingement. A posterosuperior internal impingement mechanism is being provoked predominately in the Neer test. The <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> narrows the distance between the insertions of the subscapularis and supraspinatus and the anterosuperior labrum, which leads to an anterosuperior impingement mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the short term effects of home {{exercise}} program and virtual reality exergaming in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS). Methods: A total of 30 patients with SAIS were randomized into two groups which are Home Exercise Program (EX Group) (mean age: 40. 6  ±  11. 7 years) and Virtual Reality Exergaming Program (WII Group) (mean age: 40. 33  ±  13. 2 years). Subjects were assessed at the first session, at the end of the treatment (6 weeks) and at 1 month follow-up. The groups were assessed and compared with Visual Analogue Scale (based on rest, activity and night pain), Neer and <b>Hawkins</b> <b>Tests,</b> Scapular Retraction Test (SRT), Scapular Assistance Test (SAT), Lateral Scapular Slide Test (LSST) and shoulder disability (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)). Results: Intensity of pain was significantly decreased in both groups with the treatment (p <  0. 05). The WII Group had significantly better results for all Neer test, SRT and SAT than the EX Group (p <  0. 05).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance of clinical tests for degenerative rotator cuff disease, {{based on a}} systematic literature review. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and Pascal Biomed until {{the first half of}} 2006 inclusive for articles that reported at least the sensitivity and specificity of clinical tests for rotator cuff disease. Predictive values and accuracy were recorded where available. The results were discussed and validated. RESULTS: We selected nine studies, of which three investigated tests for subacromial impingement syndrome and seven tests for rotator cuff tendinopathy. The Neer and <b>Hawkins</b> <b>tests</b> had good sensitivity but low specificity for subacromial impingement syndrome. For diagnosing tears of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus, the Jobe sign and the full can test showed similar performance characteristics to the Patte test and resisted external rotation with the elbow at the side flexed at 90 degrees. For diagnosing tendinopathies with or without tears, active unresisted external rotation for the infraspinatus and the lift off test for the subscapularis were specific but lacked sensitivity. In one study, limitation of the range of active unresisted internal rotation was sensitive and specific for subscapularis tendon disease. The palm up test performed poorly for diagnosing long head of biceps disease. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the diagnostic performance of clinical tests for rotator cuff tendon disease are fragmentary. However objective data exist to support the usefulness of some of these tests. Further studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: If {{shoulder}} impingement isn´t properly diagnosed {{and treated}} this may cause damage to subacromial structures, hence give decreased {{range of motion}} and pain. Good reliability is of outmost importance to ensure proper diagnosis. Aim of study: To examine test-retest reliability of four tests used in the diagnosis of shoulder impingement, as {{expressed in terms of}} agreement between two therapists. Problem: What is the agreement between two therapists conducting clinical provocation tests in the diagnosis of shoulder impingement? Material and methods: A cross sectional design was used. Two blinded therapists conducted <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test,</b> Neers test, Jobes test and Painful arc on a sample of healthy individuals, and patients with shoulder impingement and other forms of shoulder pathology. The testers used the same test protocol, but no patients were tested together before the study start. The sequences of testers and tests were randomly selected. The shoulder patients were recruited from a shoulder clinic and the diagnosis was verified by ultrasound. The planned sample size was 50. The tests were scored as positive or negative. Reliability was expressed in terms of Cohens Cappa and percentage agreement. Results: 33 participants were included and tested: Shoulder impingement (n = 13), other pathology in the shoulder (n = 4) and participants without shoulder problems (n = 16). Kappavalues ranged from 0. 76 to 0. 64, and the percentage agreement from 87, 9 % to 81, 8 %. <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> obtained the largest Kappa-value, followed by Neers test, Jobes test and Painful arc.

40|$|Test of {{homogeneity}} of covariances (or homoscedasticity) among several groups has many applications in statistical analysis. In {{the context of}} incomplete data analysis, tests of homoscedasticity among groups of cases with identical missing data patterns have been proposed to test whether data are missing completely at random (MCAR). These tests of MCAR require large sample sizes n and/or large group sample sizes ni, and they usually fail when applied to non-normal data. Hawkins (1981) proposed a test of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity that is an exact test for complete data when ni are small. This paper proposes a modification of this test for complete data to improve its performance, and extends its application to test of homoscedasticity and MCAR when data are multivariate normal and incomplete. Moreover, it is shown that the statistic used in the <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> {{in conjunction with a}} nonparametric k-sample test can be used to obtain a nonparametric test of homoscedasticity that works well for both normal and non-normal data. It is explained how a combination of the proposed normal-theory <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> and the nonparametric test can be employed to test for homoscedasticity, MCAR, and multivariate normality. Simulation studies show that the newly proposed tests generally outperform their existing competitors in terms of type I error rejection rates. Also, a power study of the proposed tests indicates good power. The proposed methods use appropriate missing data imputations to impute missing data. Methods of multiple imputation are described and one of the methods is employed to confirm the result of our single imputation methods. Examples are provided where multiple imputation enables one to identify group or groups whose covariance matrices differ from the majority of other groups...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{case series}} was to document {{the outcome of a}} home-exercise program used alone and combined with a semi-standardised osteopathic treatment plan for those with shoulder impingement syndrome. Six participants with shoulder impingement were randomised into either a home-exercise group (n= 3) or osteopathic group (n= 3) and were followed during the ten week study period. All participants completed a 6 -week home-exercise program aimed at centering the humeral head within the glenoid fossa and received 6 supervised training sessions. In addition, participants in the osteopathic group received 6 osteopathic treatments. Shoulder pain and function was measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) during physical examination of the shoulder. Outcome measures were taken at three baseline measurements, after the final intervention, and at a 2 -week follow-up session. Clinically meaningful change was defined as a pre-post reduction greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for each respective outcome measure. All participants demonstrated clinically meaningful change for the SPADI, DASH, and NPRS for both the Neer and <b>Hawkins</b> impingement <b>tests</b> at post-intervention and 2 -week follow-up. Clinically meaningful change was demonstrated at the 2 -week follow-up for five participants for the painful arc test, five participants for the empty can test, one participant for the active-resisted internal rotation test, and four participants for the active-resisted external rotation test.

The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine the}} most effective treatment protocol in the management of impingement syndrome of the shoulder due to supraspinatus tendonitis. This randomised study consisted of three groups of ten patients, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. All potential candidates for the trial were examined and admitted once all the exclusion and inclusion criteria had been met. Once joint restrictions were found in the cervical and/ or thoracic spine and the acromioclavicular joint, diversified chiropractic manipulative therapy was administered to all the patients. Group A received cervical and/ or thoracic spine manipulations, Group B received acromioclavicular joint manipulations, and Group C received a combination of spinal manipulations (cervical and/ or thoracic) and acromioclavicular joint manipulations. Patients were treated over a two-week treatment period. Measurements were recorded on the first, third and sixth treatments. The objective data consisted of pain free shoulder abduction range of motion, the presence of a painful arc of the shoulder, a positive supraspinatus test and/or Neers and/or <b>Hawkins</b> impingement <b>test.</b> The subjective data included the numerical pain rating scale 101 questionnaire. The statistical analysis that was conducted included the One Way ANOVA (analysis of variance) as well as the Student-Newman-Keuls Method to compare intra-group and inter-group data. Statistically significant changes were seen in all three groups. However, group A (cervical and/ or thoracic spinal manipulations) and group B (acromioclavicular joint manipulations) showed to be the most effective in treating impingement syndrome of the shoulder.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Subacromial {{impingement}} syndrome (SIS) is {{a frequent}} cause of shoulder pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diagnostic values of clinical diagnostic tests, in patients with SIS.  METHODS— 72 female, 48  male patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Five had bilateral shoulder pain, so 125  painful shoulders were evaluated. Details were recorded about the patients' ages and sexes, as well as characteristics of pain and related problems. Detailed physical examination and routine laboratory tests were performed. Conventional radiography and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder region of all patients were performed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the results of subacromial injection test, a reference standard test for SIS. Test positive patients constituted SIS group and test negative patients the non-SIS group. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of some clinical diagnostic tests such as Neer, Hawkins, horizontal adduction, painful arc, drop arm, Yergason and Speed tests for SIS were determined by using 2  ×  2  table.  RESULTS—The most sensitive diagnostic tests were found to be <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> (92. 1 %), Neer test (88. 7 %) and horizontal adduction test (82. 0 %). Tests with highest specificity were drop arm test (97. 2 %), Yergason test (86. 1 %) and painful arc test (80. 5 %) consecutively.  CONCLUSION—The highly sensitive tests seem to have low specificity values and the highly specific ones to have low sensitivity values. Although this finding suggests that these diagnostic tests are insufficient for certain diagnosis, it is suggested they play an important part in clinical evaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Shoulder pain is {{a common}} {{complain}} in the population. Subacromial impingement syndrome(SIS) is cause of many of these. SIS is a clinical diagnosis, mainly based on impingement signs. Clinical tests used for diagnosing specific disease, must be valid and reliable and have as high sensitivity and specificity as possible. They should be easy to learn and to reproduce. Material and method: Tests included were Neers test, <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test,</b> painful arch and isometric test of the supraspinatus. 25 patients referred to the Orthopeadic Dep., Ullevål hospital, for chronic pain in the shoulder, were consecutively included in the study. 3 patients had bilateral shoulder pain. A total of 28 shoulders were examined first by a medical student, then by either of two experienced physicans. The student was taught by the most experienced doctor. There was agreement on how to score the tests in advance. Aim: To check inter-rater-agreement between the examiners for each test. Results: The inter-rater-agreement was poor and varied a lot with which examiners that was compared. Generally, there was better agreement between the most experienced physican and the student. Conclusion: The poor results {{may be explained by}} little experience by the student, not enough training in advance, uncertainty in interpreting the tests results or that the test are too complicated. The study has a weakness in few patients included and that only two examiners have examined each patient. There is still much uncertainty concerning inter-rater-agreement of clinical tests used in diagnosing SIS. Further studies should be done...|$|E
40|$|Background Between 30 - 50 % of the {{population}} experience shoulder pain every year. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) {{is the most common}} shoulder disorder, and represents 44 - 65 % of shoulder problems encountered in clinical practice. It is important that the diagnostic tests are reliable as well as valid. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the test-retest reliability of four known impingement tests from clinical practice. The study is part of a larger study in which the investigation of inter tester reliability and diagnostic validity are included. Research question How good is the test-retest reliability of four shoulder impingement tests; Hawkins-Kennedy test, Neer sign, Jobe supraspinatus test and Painful arc? Methods In this study the degree of correlation between the scores from two therapists at four impingement tests where investigated by Kappa statistics and percentage agreement. To ensure variation in scores the samples consisted of patients with verified positive impingement, patients with other shoulder pathology and shoulder healthy subjects. Ultrasound was used as a diagnostic tool to verify whether patients had impingement or other shoulder pathology. A total of 34 participants were included. Result Jobe supraspinatustest and Neers sign got the best results with high kappa values of 0. 94 and percentage agreement of 97 %. <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> had a kappa value of 0. 82 and 92 % agreement, while Painful arc achieved a kappa value of 0. 64 and 82. 4 % agreement.

40|$|Objective Shoulder pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in the population. For optimal treatment, it is important with valid and reliable tests. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the discriminate ability of four physical tests used to assess subacromial impingement syndrome. Research question “How is the discrimination ability of four physical tests in diagnosing subacromial impingement syndrome confirmed by diagnostic ultrasound?” Methods The study is a cross sectional study assessing the diagnostic accuracy of four physical shoulder tests. The participants (n= 17, Male 53 %, mean age: 47) were recruited after being diagnosed by ultrasound. 16 participants without shoulder pain were also recruited. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy of the tests were examined. Result The diagnostic accuracy of Neers, Hawkins, Jobe and Painful Arc tests was 64 %, 71 %, 82 % and 64 % respectively (sensitivity was 77 %, 92 %, 77 %, 70 % and specificity was 25 %, 0 %, 100 %, 50 %) compared with other shoulder pathology. Compared to the asymptomatic participants, the diagnostic acccuracy of Neers, Hawkins, Jobe og Painful Arc Tests was 90 %, 90 %, 90 % and 86 % respectively (sensitivity was 77 %, 92 %, 77 %, 70 % and spesificity 100 %, 88 %, 100 %, 100 %). Conclusion Compared to other shoulder pathology, Neers, Hawkins and Painful Arc Tests demonstrated little probability of impingement with negative test results, while Jobe Test indicated a high chance of impingement with positv test result.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{examine the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of standard clinical tests for the shoulder in recreational athletes with activity related pain. Design Cohort study with index test of clinical examination and reference standard of arthroscopy. Setting Sports Medicine clinic in Sheffield, U. K. Participants 101 recreational athletes (82 male, 19 female; mean age 40. 8 ± 14. 6 years) over a six year period. Interventions Bilateral evaluation of {{movements of the}} shoulder followed by standardized shoulder tests, formulation of clinical diagnosis and shoulder arthroscopy conducted by the same surgeon. Main Outcome Measurements Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio for a positive test and over-all accuracy of clinical examination was examined retrospectively and compared with arthroscopy. Results Isolated pathology was rare, most patients (72 %) having more than one injury recorded. O'Brien's clinical test had a mediocre sensitivity (64 %) and over-all accuracy (54 %) for diagnosing SLAP lesions. <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> and Jobe's test had the highest but still not impressive over-all accuracy (67 %) and sensitivity (67 %) for rotator cuff pathology respectively. External and internal impingement tests showed similar levels of accuracy. When a positive test was observed in one {{of a combination of}} shoulder tests used for diagnosing SLAP lesions or rotator cuff disease, sensitivity increased substantially whilst specificity decreased. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of isolated standard shoulder tests in recreational athletes was over-all very poor, potentially due to the majority of athletes (71 %) having concomitant shoulder injuries. Most likely, this means that many of these injuries are missed in general practice and treatment is therefore delayed. Clinical examination of the shoulder should involve a combination of clinical tests in order to identify likely intra articular pathology which may warrant referral to specialist for surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{examination}} {{tests of}} the shoulder (PETS) are clinical examination maneuvers designed to aid the assessment of shoulder complaints. Despite more than 180 PETS described in the literature, evidence of their validity and usefulness in diagnosing the shoulder is questioned. Methods This meta-analysis aims to use diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) to evaluate how much PETS shift overall probability and to rank the test performance of single PETS in order to aid the clinician 2 ̆ 019 s choice of which tests to use. This study adheres to the principles outlined in the Cochrane guidelines and the PRISMA statement. A fixed effect model {{was used to assess}} the overall diagnostic validity of PETS by pooling DOR for different PETS with similar biomechanical rationale when possible. Single PETS were assessed and ranked by DOR. Clinical performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and likelihood ratio. Results Six thousand nine-hundred abstracts and 202 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 20 articles were eligible and data from 11 articles could be included in the meta-analysis. All PETS for SLAP (superior labral anterior posterior) lesions pooled gave a DOR of 1. 38 [1. 13, 1. 69]. The Supraspinatus test for any full thickness rotator cuff tear obtained the highest DOR of 9. 24 (sensitivity was 0. 74, specificity 0. 77). Compression-Rotation test obtained the highest DOR (6. 36) among single PETS for SLAP lesions (sensitivity 0. 43, specificity 0. 89) and <b>Hawkins</b> <b>test</b> obtained the highest DOR (2. 86) for impingement syndrome (sensitivity 0. 58, specificity 0. 67). No single PETS showed superior clinical test performance. Conclusions The clinical performance of single PETS is limited. However, when the different PETS for SLAP lesions were pooled, we found a statistical significant change in post-test probability indicating an overall statistical validity. We suggest that clinicians choose their PETS among those with the highest pooled DOR and to assess validity to their own specific clinical settings, review the inclusion criteria of the included primary studies.
