5000|$|A {{fire barrier}} wall, or a fire partition, is a <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> {{assembly}} that provides {{lower levels of}} protection than typically provided by a fire wall. The main differences are that these fire resistant walls are not structurally self-sufficient.|$|E
5000|$|... "Deluge" [...] {{systems are}} systems {{in which all}} {{sprinklers}} connected to the water piping system are open, in that the heat sensing operating element is removed, or specifically designed as such. These systems are used for special hazards where rapid fire spread is a concern, as they provide a simultaneous application of water over the entire hazard. They are sometimes installed in personnel egress paths or building openings to slow travel of fire (e.g. openings in a <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall).</b>|$|E
50|$|Performance based design {{takes into}} account the {{potential}} conditions during a fire. Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions. The testing results in an assigned listing number for the fire-rated assembly that defines the expected fire resistance duration and wall structural integrity under the tested conditions. Designers may elect to specify a listed fire wall assembly or design a wall system that would require performance testing to certify the expected protections before use of the designed <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> system.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main classifications of fire rated walls: fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions. To the layperson, the common use of {{language}} typically includes all three when referring to a firewall unless distinguishing between them becomes necessary. In addition specialty <b>fire-rated</b> <b>walls</b> such as a High Challenge Fire Wall would require further distinctions.|$|R
50|$|Motor control centers usually sit on floors, {{which are}} often {{required}} to have a fire-resistance rating. Firestops may be required for cables that penetrate <b>fire-rated</b> floors and <b>walls.</b>|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) {{deemed to}} satisfy {{solution}} for houses and small multi-unit dwellings requires external walls within 1 m of and at angles less than 90 ° to a property boundary to be fire-rated {{to a minimum}} 30 -min fire resistance rating (FRR). The NZBC also requires structural building systems to remain stable during and after fire when subjected to a uniformly distributed horizontal face load of 0. 5 kPa ‘in any direction’. This research investigated the fire performance of laterally loaded light timber-framed compartments, to assess their suitability under the NZBC requirements for residential buildings. The research involved a full-scale standard furnace experiment and a full-scale compartment fire experiment. The building design was based on common New Zealand residential building construction for a light timber-frame building with compartment dimensions of 4. 33 m × 3. 35 m and stud height of 2. 4 m. One of the 4. 33 m walls was 30 -min fire-rated and the other building elements were of typical non-fire-rated construction. Internal wall and ceiling linings were 10 mm thick standard grade plasterboard, except for the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> which had 10 mm fibre-reinforced plasterboard {{on both sides of}} the timber framing. The external cladding and roof consisted of light-weight sheet materials except for the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> which had no additional covering. The <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> was subjected to a lateral load applied at the top plate equivalent to a 0. 5 kPa face load. The roof truss system was an integral component in providing lateral support to the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> and each roof truss spanned between the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> and the parallel 4. 33 m wall. Each roof truss was designed with a splice in the centre of the bottom chord, connected by toothed metal connector plates. In the furnace experiment the compartment was heated to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve, failure of the roof truss system at the truss connector plate was observed after 30. 5 min, causing failure of the roof resulting in lateral deflection of the loaded <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall.</b> It was found there was non-uniform temperature distribution in the compartment. An analysis of the failure taking into consideration temperature distribution in the compartment suggests that the roof truss system with splice supporting the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> would fail in lateral stability after 26 min if the furnace had been driven to achieve the ISO 834 time-temperature relationship at ceiling level. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 19. 5 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve. The compartment experiment was a natural fire with a fixed initial ventilation and fuel load consisting of wood cribs. The roof truss design incorporated specific protection of the splice using blocks of timber. The wall system failed in lateral stability after 28 min and before all the fuel in the compartment was consumed. Applying a time equivalence method suggests that the <b>fire-rated</b> <b>wall</b> restraint system performance would be the equivalent of 33. 5 min in a standard fire resistance test for the compartment. Comparing the results for Experiments # 1 and # 2, the protection added to the splice improved the performance of the lateral load restraint system from 26 min to 33. 5 min. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 26 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve...|$|E
