25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used for}} water entry from boats, depending on {{the layout of the}} vessel, particularly the freeboard at the entry points. Large dive boats often have a permanent or folding platform at the stern just above the water, intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient for <b>divers.</b> Such <b>platforms</b> will usually be provided with steps or ladders from the deck, and folding ladders into the water.|$|R

6000|$|It was gray, harsh, easterly weather, {{the swell}} ran pretty high, {{and out in}} the open there were [...] "skipper's daughters," [...] when I found myself at last on the <b>diver's</b> <b>platform,</b> twenty pounds of lead upon each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen underclothing. One moment, the salt wind was {{whistling}} round my night-capped head; the next, I was crushed almost double {{under the weight of the}} helmet. As that intolerable burthern was laid upon me, I could have found it in my heart (only for shame's sake) to cry off from the whole enterprise. But it was too late. The attendants began to turn the hurdy-gurdy, and the air to whistle through the tube; some one screwed in the barred window of the vizor; and I was cut off in a moment from my fellow-men; standing there in their midst, but quite divorced from intercourse: a creature deaf and dumb, pathetically looking forth upon them from a climate of his own. Except that I could move and feel, I was like a man fallen in a catalepsy. But time was scarce given me to realise my isolation; the weights were hung upon my back and breast, the signal rope was thrust into my unresisting hand; and setting a twenty-pound foot upon the ladder, I began ponderously to descend.|$|R

40|$|Jordan and Henderson (1995) outline a {{research}} methodology they term interaction analysis—a powerful method for investigating human {{activity in which}} a group of researchers {{come together in a}} meeting to offer their insights on some video recorded event. Although the interaction analysis approach proved to be highly influential for ethnographers and other social scientists, it was limited by the technologies available at the time of Jordan and Henderson’s writing (VHS tapes, etc.). Reconstructing the contextually grounded insights of researchers can be an onerous task, not to mention the challenge of accommodating the schedules of several busy researchers. Fortunately, the decreasing costs and increased accessibility of digital video technologies has made it possible to support fluid conversations around a video record without the constraints of an in-person meeting. Pea, Lindgren, and Rosen (2006) present a framework for enhancing interaction analysis with internet technologies that they term computer-supported collaborative video analysis (CSCVA). They also describe a software environment designed to facilitate CSCVA in the research community called DIVER (Digital Interactive Video Exploration and Reflection). The purpose of this session will be introduce to participants the theoretical issues around CSCVA and give them practice collaborating on video analysis using the <b>DIVER</b> <b>platform.</b> Session participants will have access to a large video data corpus that we have collected on families discussing the role that mathematics plays in activity at home. The goal of the session is to build fluency among participants with CSCVA tools and to have them recognize th...|$|R
