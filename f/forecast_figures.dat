If not achieved, the Commission will carry out a [...] "careful analysis" [...] based on (1) a top-down assessment of the adjusted change of the structural balance (adjusting for: (i) the impact of revisions in potential GDP growth compared with the growth scenario underpinning the Council recommendation, (ii) the impact of revenue windfalls/shortfalls relative to the ones used in the baseline scenario, and (iii) the negative impact of the changeover to ESA 2010 on the cost of tax credits) and (2) a bottom-up assessment of the consolidation measures undertaken by the authorities for the period in concern (which differs from the adjusted top-down assessment by calculating the structural adjustment effort unaffected by potential changes in public debt interest rates and potential changes of the GDP deflator - compared to the <b>forecast</b> <b>figures</b> utilized by the baseline scenario in the previous 126(7) report calling for [...] "effective action to end an excessive deficit"). In the event that both (1)+(2) return a shortfall for the targeted structural deficit improvements, the state will be deemed not to have implemented the required amount of corrective measures, equal to the launch of a 126(9) report requiring immediate effective action to be taken to make up for the recorded shortfall.|$|E

What is fed as an input into public deliberation and decision-making about technology development is thus not a forecast of the future, but a menu of visions of various possible futures, which can then be taken into account in the processes of research and innovation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine various DoE methods for {{uncertainty}} quantification of production forecast during reservoir management. Considering all uncertainties for analysis can be time consuming and expensive. Uncertainty screening using experimental design methods helps reducing number of parameters to manageable sizes. However, adoption of various methods is more often based on experimenter discretions or company practices.

The consequence is the underperformance of the project when compared with the actual value of the project. This study presents the analysis of the three families of designs used for screening and four DoE methods used for response surface modeling during uncertainty analysis. The screening methods (sensitivity by one factor at-a-time, fractional experiment, and Plackett-Burman design) were critically examined and analyzed using numerical flow simulation.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the initiation of accounting information system projects. Specifically, it examines the role of the predictive analytics (PA) project initiator in the integration of financial and operational sales forecasts. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a field study method to address the studied phenomenon in eight Finnish companies that have recently adopted PA systems. The data are primarily based on 19 interviews in the companies and five interviews with the PA consultants. Findings The authors found that initiators appear to play a major role regarding the degree of integration of financial and operational sales forecasts. The initiators from an accounting function have a tendency to pay more attention to the integration than the representatives from other functions, such as operations and sales. Practical implications The study also makes a practical contribution to companies in showing and discussing the important role of the accounting department as an initiator of a project if the target is to achieve a tight coupling of financial and operational <b>forecast</b> <b>figures,</b> i. e., “one set of numbers”.

40|$|This chapter {{finds that}} {{increased}} public infrastructure investment raises output {{in both the}} short and long term, particularly during periods of economic slack and when investment efficiency is high. This suggests that in countries with infrastructure needs, {{the time is right}} for an infrastructure push: borrowing costs are low and demand is weak in advanced economies, and there are infrastructure bottlenecks in many emerg-ing market and developing economies. Debt-financed projects could have large output effects without increas-ing the debt-to-GDP ratio, if clearly identified infra-structure needs are met through efficient investment. F ive years after the global fi nancial crisis, the global recovery continues but remains weak. In many advanced economies there is still sub-stantial economic slack, and infl ation remains too low in the euro area. Robust demand momentum has not yet taken hold, despite prolonged accommoda-tive monetary policy, slowing in the pace of fi scal con-solidation, and improvements in fi nancial conditions. As noted in Chapter 1, there are now worries that demand will remain persistently weak—a possibility that has been described as “secular stagnation ” (Sum-mers 2013; Teulings and Baldwin 2014). In emerging market economies the concerns are of a diff erent nature. After a sharp rebound following the crisis, growth rates {{in the last few years}} have fallen not only below the postcrisis peak of 2010 – 11, but also below levels seen in the decade before the crisis.

40|$|The {{combination}} of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements of cosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with any individual probe. We examine the {{combination of}} two highly correlated probes of late-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with photometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions from a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so that our results are applicable {{to a range of}} current and future photometric redshift (e. g. KiDS, DES, HSC, Euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e. g. DESI, 4 MOST, Sumire) surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to measure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping combination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger than that produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the surveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are orthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum formalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the surveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance matrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these cross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a factor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity. The exact <b>forecast</b> <b>figures</b> of merit and same-sky benefits can be radically affected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in a sensitivity analysis. We show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robust results which give a good average picture of the science return from combining photometric and spectroscopic surveys.

40|$|Luftverkehrsprognosen stellen ein wichtiges Instrument dar, die Luftverkehrsinfrastruktur zu beeinflussen. Hinter vielen der Projekte, die von Luftverkehrsprognosen begleitet werden, stehen Interessen. Dies gilt insbesondere für Ausbauvorhaben von Flughäfen, die von eindeutigen Zielen und Wünschen getragen werden. Die Gutachter, die im Rahmen solcher Ausbauvorhaben tätig werden, sind der Gefahr ausgesetzt, beeinflusste Prognosen zu erstellen. Es ist Ziel der folgenden Arbeit, die Qualität von Luftverkehrsprognosen in Deutschland empirisch zu überprüfen. Dabei stößt man auf das Problem, dass es für Luftverkehrsprognosen praktisch nur einen Gutachter gibt. Dies ist die Intraplan Consult GmbH. Prognosen anderer Gutachter liegen in so geringer Zahl vor, dass sie nicht empirisch auswertbar sind. Wir beschränken uns im Folgenden deshalb darauf, die Prognosen von Intraplan Consult GmbH zu analysieren. Wir glauben, dass die Untersuchungsergebnisse allgemeingültigen Charakter haben und auf andere Luftverkehrsprognosen übertragbar sind. Es werden drei Fragestellungen untersucht. •	Überzeichnen die Luftverkehrsprognosen der Intraplan Consult GmbH die tatsächliche Verkehrsentwicklung? •	Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass Überzeichnungen bei bestimmten Prognosegrößen (z. B. PAX, Fracht, Flugbewegungen) besonders häufig vorkommen? •	Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass Überzeichnungen bei bestimmten Gutachtentypen bzw. Gutachtenanlässen (z. B. Erweiterungen, behördliche Genehmigungen) besonders häufig vorkommen? Die empirische Untersuchung zeigte, dass die Prognosen insgesamt betrachtet tendenziell die tatsächliche Verkehrsentwicklung überschätzen. Es konnte zudem ermittelt werden, dass die Qualität der Ergebnisse stark streut und sich nicht normalverteilt verhält. Weiterhin konnten Wendepunktefehler im Prognose-Realisierungs-Diagramm beobachtet werden. Das bedeutet, dass das Modell von Intraplan Wendepunkte von Entwicklungen nicht erkennen kann. Die Airlines haben in den von den Prognosen erfassten Zeiträumen Strategiewechsel vorgenommen, die von Intraplan nicht erkannt wurden. Im weiteren Verlauf wurden die drei Prognosegrößen (i) Passagiere, (ii) Fracht- und Postaufkommen sowie (iii) Flugbewegungen einzeln analysiert. Alle drei Größen zeigten systematisch überschätzende Prognosen. Besonders stark ist dies bei den Flugbewegungen zu erkennen. Die Prognosen wurden nach ihrem Zweck in die Kategorien „Planfälle bei Genehmigungsgutachten“, „Worst-Case-Fälle bei Genehmigungsgutachten“ sowie „Marktstudien“ getrennt. Alle drei Kategorien weisen systematische Fehlschätzungen auf. Bei den Marktstudien liegen systematische Überschätzungen vor. Sie sind tendenziell etwas geringer als bei Planfallprognosen, wo die Überschätzungen erhebliche Größenordnungen annehmen (20 - 50 % zu hohe Wachstumsraten). Worst-Case-Prognosen unterschätzen die tatsächliche Entwicklung systematisch. Da die beiden letzteren Kategorien (also Planfälle vs. Worst-Case-Fälle) im Zusammenhang mit Ausbauvorhaben an Flughäfen stehen, liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass im Rahmen der Genehmigungsgutachten die Worst-Case-Prognosen gezielt zu niedrig angesetzt werden (Unterschätzung), während die Planfallprognosen zu hoch angesetzt werden (Überschätzung), um das jeweilige Ausbauvorhaben in einem bedeutenderen Licht erscheinen zu lassen. Die Wendepunktfehler zeigen, dass Intraplan Strategiewechsel der Luftverkehrsunternehmen nicht richtig prognostiziert. Dies kann im Zusammenhang mit dem von den Auftraggebern verfolgten Zweck der Projekte stehen: Andere als die von den Auftraggebern gewünschten Strategien werden nicht abgebildet. Dieses sind, wie die empirischen ex post Ergebnisse zeigen, weder alle denkbaren Strategien und nicht einmal die wahrscheinlichsten Strategien. In der Luftverkehrswirtschaft wird argumentiert, dass die Prognosen von Intraplan nur wegen der Finanzkrise 2008, die nicht vorhersehbar gewesen wäre, so schlecht seien. Unsere Analyse zeigt für einige Flughäfen tatsächlich deutliche Brüche der Entwicklung nach der Finanzkrise. Bei anderen Flughäfen ist demgegenüber eine Konstanz der Entwicklung vor und nach der Finanzkrise festzustellen. Auch bei diesen Flughäfen ist aber die Prognose schlecht. Darüber hinaus gibt es Flughäfen, bei denen Airlines Strategiewechsel schon vor der Finanzkrise vorgenommen haben. Auch bei diesen hat das Prognosemodell von Intraplan schlechte Resultate erzielt. Bei anderen Flughäfen dagegen, ist die Prognoseleistung trotz Finanzkrise gut. Alles in allem zeigt sich deshalb, dass es weniger die Finanzkrise von 2008 ist, die zu Fehlprognosen führt, als die fehlende Fähigkeit, die Strategien der Airlines richtig abzubilden. Aviation traffic {{forecasts}} and airport {{analyses are}} important instruments which influence decisions on aviation related infrastructure. Behind many of such infrastructure projects, which {{are supported by}} forecast analyses, one finds political interests. This is especially the case for aviation projects, such as infrastructure enlargement projects of airports, which are motivated by distinct goals and desires. Referees who act within this framework {{are exposed to the}} risk of producing biased results. The quality of such aviation traffic forecasts {{is the subject of this}} working paper. To begin with, one major obstacle is that there is only one such referee available in Germany - Intraplan Consult GmbH. Other referees have only a minimal, insignificant share of output, which cannot be used for any further empirical investigation. This is the reason why the present working paper focuses on airport analyses produced by Intraplan Consult GmbH. We believe that these research results are of common character, and thus are transferable to other related airport studies. The following three research questions have been investigated: •	Do recent aviation traffic forecasts performed by Intraplan Consult GmbH overestimate actual traffic developments? •	Are there any indications that some specific forecast measures (such as PAX, freight and cargo, flight movement) might be overestimated exceptionally frequently? •	Are there any indications that specific types and events of forecast analysis (such as airport expansion projects, official authorisation of a project by the public administration) overestimated exceptionally frequently? Empirical investigation has shown that forecast analyses tend to be indeed overestimated, compared to the actual traffic developments. It could be shown that the quality of the research results is widespread and not normally distributed. Furthermore, systematic errors with regard to the point of inflection in forecast-realisation-diagrams were identified. This means that models constructed by Intraplan could not identify points of inflection on the development path in the real world. For instance, airlines have undergone structure and strategic changes over the periods of investigation which could not be captured by Intraplan models. In addition, three forecast measures, namely the amount of (i) passenger, (ii) freight and post and the (iii) flight movements, have been analysed. All three of them have shown systematic overestimated forecast results. In particular, forecasts of flight movements have been largely overestimated. These forecast analyses have further been categorized according to their purpose, namely project cases for the issue of approval certificates, worst-case scenarios for the issue of approval certificates and market studies. All three categories show systematic misjudgements and miscalculations. Regarding the market studies, systematic overestimation was identified. It tends to be less severe than for the project cases, where extreme estimates of 20 - 50 % higher growth rates were found. In contrast to this, worst-case scenarios systematically underestimated actual development trends. The last two of which suggest the assumption that, when analysing enlargement projects of airports, worst-case scenario <b>forecast</b> <b>figures</b> and project case <b>forecast</b> <b>figures</b> have been deliberately manipulated in order to put the expansion project in question into the right perspective. Misjudgement by Intraplan, regarding the points of inflection, shows that they cannot forecast any strategic development by the aviation industry flawlessly. However, it can be assumed that this may also be in the interest of their contractors. Others as those suggested strategies by their clients are not included in their models. To further strengthen this suggestion, all empirical ex post results show that only a small share of all possible strategies, and especially the most improbable strategies, had been used. The aviation industry argues that miscalculation by Intraplan only relates to the events around the financial crisis in 2008, which have been unpredictable. Our research results showed that few airports had indeed been hit, regarding their development, by the financial crisis in 2008 and after. Others, however, have shown no effect and continued their rather constant development before and after the financial crisis. Forecast analyses have also been inaccurate and false for these airports. In addition to this, some of these airports had already undergone a strategic change, airline strategic change, before the financial crisis. As well, with regard to these airports, the forecast model by Intraplan produced false results. On the other hand, some forecast results have been correct, despite the financial crisis. All in all, it can be argued that incorrect forecasts have not been caused as much by the financial crisis as by the missing capacities of the model to incorporate strategic change...|$|E

40|$|It {{is obvious}} that {{forecasts}} are of great importance and widely used in economics and finance. Quite simply, good forecasts lead to good decisions. The importance of forecast evaluation and combination techniques follows immediately [...] forecast users naturally have {{a keen interest in}} monitoring and improving forecast performance. More generally, <b>forecast</b> evaluation <b>figures</b> prominently in many questions in empirical economics and finance. We provide selective account of forecast evaluation and combination methods. First we discuss evaluation of a single forecast, and in particular, evaluation of whether and how it may be improved. Second, we discuss the evaluation and comparison of the accuracy of competing forecasts. Third, we discuss whether and how a set of forecasts may be combined to produce a superior composite forecast. Fourth, we describe a number of forecast evaluation topics of particular relevance in economics and finance, including methods for evaluating direction-of-change forecasts, probability forecasts and volatility forecasts. ...|$|R

The EIU estimates that Iran's net FDI flow will rise by 100 per cent within {{the next four years}} (2010–14). The Economist estimates that FDI (net inflow) in Iran was $1.4 billion [...] in 2011 (equivalent to 0.3% of GDP) down from $3.2 billion in 2010. The report <b>forecasts</b> this <b>figure</b> for 2012 to fall to $1.25 billion, but increase again for the next 3 years and to reach $1.8 billion in 2015. The Government of Iran says planned FDI in 2011 was $4.3 billion and planned FDI will reach $8–10 billion in 2012–13. However, UNCTAD later reported that FDI inflow in Iran was $3.05 billion in 2013, while Iran’s FDI in other countries (i.e. outflow FDI) was $380 million.|$|R

To verify the model obtained using the one Moving Range Chart. The control charts are {{used to determine the}} change in the pattern of file seen from the residual value (the difference between the actual file and the file forecasting). File used in this study the average wind speed in the Tanjung Emas harbor during January 2008 to December 2013. The best of Seasonal ARIMA model is ARIMA (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1) 12. The results of the verification using the Moving Range Control Chart on the model showed that all residual values are within control limits to the length of the shortest interval, means of verification results show that the model is a good model used for forecasting future periods. Forecasting is generated during the period of the next 15 shows the seasonal pattern. This is shown in the <b>figure</b> <b>forecast</b> 2014 average wind speeds are highest in January, as well as <b>forecasting</b> the 2015 <b>figures</b> the average speed of the highest winds also occurred in January. Forecasting results reflect past file, because the actual file used also showed a seasonal pattern with the same seasonal period is annual, where the numbers mean wind speeds are highest in January.

40|$|Internet usage {{increases}} {{every year}} {{and the need to}} estimate the growth of the generated traffic has become a major topic. <b>Forecasting</b> actual <b>figures</b> in advance is essential for bandwidth allocation, networking design and investment planning. In this thesis novel mathematical equations are presented to model and to predict long-term Internet traffic in terms of total aggregating volume, globally and more locally. Historical traffic data from consecutive years have revealed hidden numerical patterns as the values progress year over year and this trend can be well represented with appropriate mathematical relations. The proposed formulae have excellent fitting properties over long-history measurements and can indicate forthcoming traffic for the next years with an exceptionally low prediction error. In cases where pending traffic data have already become available, the suggested equations provide more successful results than the respective projections that come from worldwide leading research. The studies also imply that future traffic strongly depends on the past activity and on the growth of Internet users, provided that a big and representative sample of pertinent data exists from large geographical areas. To {{the best of my knowledge}} this work is the first to introduce effective prediction methods that exclusively rely on the static attributes and the progression properties of historical values...|$|R

In Section  6, an irradiance forecast model based on neural network technology is presented. Feed forward neural network architecture is presented in Section  7. In Section  8, a PV model is presented which is used to convert an irradiance forecast into a PV power forecast. In Section  9, irradiance forecast and PV power <b>forecast</b> results and <b>figures</b> are presented. Finally, Section 10 concludes this paper.|$|R
40|$|When <b>forecasting</b> sales <b>figures,</b> {{not only}} the sales history but also the future price of a product will {{influence}} the sales quantity. At first sight, multivariate time series {{seem to be the}} appropriate model for this task. Nonetheless, in real life history is not always repeatable, i. e., in the case of sales history there is only one price for a product at a given time. This complicates the design of a multivariate time series. However, for some seasonal or perishable products the price is rather a function of the expiration date than of the sales history. This additional information can help to design a more accurate and causal time series model. The proposed solution uses an univariate time series model but takes the price of a product as a parameter that influences systematically the prediction based on a calculated periodicity. The price influence is computed based on historical sales data using correlation analysis and adjustable price ranges to identify products with comparable history. The periodicity is calculated based on a novel approach that is based on data folding and Pearson Correlation. Compared to other techniques this approach is easy to compute and allows to preset the price parameter for predictions and simulations. Tests with data from the Data Mining Cup 2012 as well as artificial data demonstrate better results than established sophisticated time series methods...|$|R
