2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into my pocket, and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
2500|$|During a September 2016 {{appearance}} on the radio show El Show de Piolín, Fox smashed a Trump piñata hanging {{on the streets of}} Los Angeles while loudly singing the traditional Piñata song. Upon breaking it open, Fox noted its lack of contents and remarked, [...] "Empty. Totally Empty. He doesn't have any brains." [...] Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with GQ, Fox expanded, [...] "I had such a joy in my heart by doing that, because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He's empty in his head. That's why <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into his head. There was no brain there. That's what he is, an empty person." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had given}} me my cue. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his {{shoulder}} and spoke sorrowfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at 'im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> pocket. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it in {{the other}} one, and arter that I stood staring at George Tebb and shaking all over.|$|R
6000|$|I {{took a deep}} breath. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the sides}} of my mouth. [...] "Cavor!" [...] I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin {{shouting}} far away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to my sword, but Checco caught {{hold of my}} arm. I {{recovered}} {{myself at}} once.|$|E
60|$|He gave such a {{start when}} <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> upon his shoulder, {{that he made}} me start too.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{upon the}} door-knob, I heard steps upon the stairs, {{and looking up}} saw Duncan Woodward descending.|$|E
60|$|And then revulsion took me, {{suddenly}} {{and without any}} cause or warning. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>my</b> face to shut out a vision whose true significance I realized as in a flash.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not ask me," [...] cried <b>I,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> before <b>my</b> eyes, for I thought I saw {{the dreaded}} spectre glide into the room; [...] "HE can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!" [...] I {{imagined}} that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the long}} red silk waist-cloth that was hanging out of the window, and we three pulled and pulled with all the {{strength}} at our command. There was something very heavy at the end, and it swore in an unknown tongue as it kicked against the City wall.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in my pocket and drew out the empty envelope.|$|E
60|$|How could I resist that? <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on hers. [...] "Don't quit, Nan. You'll {{never forgive}} {{yourself}} if you quit. Take it from me, Whit will pull out of this hole!" ...|$|E
60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> over <b>my</b> eyes to shut it out, but it pressed in upon my {{consciousness}} insistently, {{and would not be}} ignored longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thin Master Barry doesn't {{know the}} widdy Kelly, I {{can tell him}} that; for when <b>I</b> <b>puts</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to a thing, I mane to pull through wid it. But tell me--all this'll be costing money, won't, it? Attorneys don't bring thim sort of things about for nothing," [...] and she gave a most contemptuous twist to the notice.|$|R
60|$|I {{was near}} Miss Dunross--near enough, when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> to touch her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha-nor do I. If I did I should {{soon find}} my mistake out. If <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{out to take}} anything, my hand is very soon bitten, I can tell you." ...|$|E
60|$|Her ear! The dear little ear which I had kissed so often. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to each little velvet shell to {{make certain}} that this sacrilege had not yet been committed.|$|E
6000|$|An unseen {{presence}} drew us together. My mother's face became resolute, commanding. I {{turned to}} Anna {{as a child}} may turn to its nurse. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> about her strong shoulders, she folded me to her, and my heart gave way. I buried my face in her breast and clung to her weakly, and burst into a passion of weeping. [...] .|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{between the}} bars to pat the glossy, heaving flank. He pulled it back, {{with a serious}} face.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> just <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> up to <b>my</b> burning {{face and}} the tears that would never come before came in a flood.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{had reached}} the lodge, where I had left my bicycle, I met Brownster, and when I saw him <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into my pocket. He had {{certainly}} been very attentive.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{under his}} shirt and felt. The skin was {{stretched}} like parchment over the bones, and the sensation produced was {{for all the world}} like running one's hand over a washboard.|$|E
60|$|The boarder was {{standing}} in the middle of the dining-room, into which the stairs led. I could not see him, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> against him as I was feeling my way across the floor.|$|E
6000|$|As we {{contemplated}} the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision {{to realize this}} same Capital sometimes was, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>my</b> pockets. A folded {{piece of paper in}} one of them attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. [...] "And bless my heart," [...] I involuntarily added aloud, [...] "it's to-night!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{became aware}} of a dull ache {{on the right side}} of <b>my</b> head. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> up <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and withdrew it moist. She saw the action.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{she threw}} herself {{down on the sofa}} and she sobbed--I never heard a girl cry like that in all my life. She shrieked, she was pretty nearly in hysterics, and I couldn't get a word out of her. When she was through at last, she was all limp and white. She wouldn't tell me anything. She simply sat and looked at the stove. Presently she got up to go. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on her {{shoulders}} and I forced her back in the chair.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into my pocket. [...] "One pound seventeen," [...] I answered, {{counting}} it. [...] "It {{will pay}} my fare to London--or {{buy me a}} dinner and a second-hand revolver. I haven't quite decided yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I could swear to that. And {{now we must}} act together. When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on him, you do the same, and give him no chance to use his sword or pistols." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know from}} her {{hardened}} lips that still her heart is Hungry for me, yet if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in her breast She puts me away, like a saleswoman whose mart is Endangered by the pilferer on his quest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{give it to}} you straight," [...] {{answered}} Link Merwell. [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>put</b> down <b>my</b> <b>hands?</b> It's {{not comfortable}} to talk with them up in the air." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and Mr. Wemmick {{at first}} {{looked at it}} as if he thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, {{correcting}} himself,-- ...|$|R
60|$|After this {{there was}} another {{interval}} of silence. Then my arm struck something hard. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and was overjoyed {{to find that it}} was the raft.|$|R
