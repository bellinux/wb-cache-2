60|$|It was now dark outside, but light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street faintly {{illuminated}} {{the part of}} the room that he was in. He had set open every door in the whole interior, above and below, but all the outer ones were locked and bolted. Sudden <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> caused him to spring to the window and look out. He saw the figure of a man moving rapidly across the lawn toward the building--saw it ascend the steps; then a projection of the wall concealed it. There was a noise as of the opening and closing of the hall door; he heard quick, heavy footsteps along the passage--heard them ascend the stairs--heard them on the uncarpeted floor of the chamber immediately overhead.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} the {{cautious}} walk-round continued, {{then there was}} a sudden <b>exclamation</b> of surprise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> for <b>the</b> blacksmith seized his adversary by the waist, and with a quick throw, caused him to turn almost a somersault in the air, and to come down on his back with stunning violence.|$|R
60|$|Loud <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{window that}} the bridegroom's {{carriage}} has just passed.|$|R
60|$|My reveries {{were broken}} in upon by a low <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boy.|$|R
60|$|<b>Exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{three of}} us attested to what we thought of that leap.|$|R
60|$|An <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other {{caused him}} to look up. Reggie Byng was staring at him, wide-eyed.|$|R
60|$|He {{rushed to}} the door and tore it open. There was a startled <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{darkness}} outside.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Crocker {{left the}} room. Bayliss, {{preparing}} {{to follow her}} example, was arrested by an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned the}} {{indicator}} of his traveling machine and immediately {{rose into the}} air, followed by a startled <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> President of France.|$|R
60|$|Both {{were enjoying}} {{the luxury of}} repose when an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guide caused the amateur detective to glance quickly toward the water's edge.|$|R
60|$|The {{party had}} {{proceeded}} {{in this fashion}} {{for nearly half a}} mile when suddenly they were attracted by a low <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mucker.|$|R
60|$|Norgate {{set down}} the {{receiver}} without listening to <b>the</b> tangle of <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other end, and walked quickly out of the shop. He re-entered his taxi.|$|R
6000|$|Quite {{pleased that}} his remarks should afford amusement, Quashy {{was about to}} launch out {{extensively}} on the [...] "great-gran'moder" [...] theme, when an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guide checked him.|$|R
60|$|So {{laughing}} and chatting {{with their eyes}} fixed on the shore the party never looked seaward, until a sudden <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mate called their attention to that direction.|$|R
60|$|There were <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> others {{standing}} {{round in}} the snow, but Kermode glanced at Ferguson. His face grew darkly red, but with an effort he controlled his anger.|$|R
60|$|Such were <b>the</b> <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> three Rover boys after {{listening}} to Bill Dangler's declaration that the lad who had run away from Putnam Hall was the nephew of Merrick.|$|R
60|$|An <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blacks for'ard sent {{both men}} glancing seaward. Around the near point of land, {{a quarter of}} a mile away and {{skirting}} the reef, a long black canoe paddled into sight.|$|R
60|$|Deerslayer was {{interrupted}} by a slight <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> girl, who, in obedience to his hurried gestures, as much as in obedience to his words, had immediately bent her looks again, in the opposite direction.|$|R
60|$|As the motor-boat swung around, the {{headlight}} flashed full {{upon our}} hero and there followed an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{manager of the}} moving-picture company, {{who was at the}} wheel of the craft, with two men beside him.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} a brief silence. <b>The</b> clamour of <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> little groups of people still filled the air outside. They could hear cars coming and going. The man whom Hunterleys and Mr. Grex were tying up was still groaning and cursing.|$|R
60|$|An <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian at {{that moment}} stopped him, for it was {{discovered}} that the horses were not there. The place was so open that concealment was not possible. The steeds of both men had somehow got rid of their hobbles and galloped away.|$|R
60|$|A common <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{young men}} proclaimed their disapprobation; {{and that night}} three of them {{actually}} repeated the thing, as a well established truth, {{and two of the}} three, failing of something better to talk about, also announced that Eve was actually engaged to be married.|$|R
60|$|There {{were many}} {{surprised}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bystanders, and, glancing at that beautiful girl, {{who was standing}} near with the others, I found her dark eyes fixed on my face {{with an expression of}} tenderness and sympathy in them that sent the blood rushing to my heart.|$|R
60|$|Wingate {{took up a}} pen, glanced {{through the}} agreement, {{and was on the}} point of signing his name when a startled <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> man by his side caused him to glance up. The door had been opened. Harrison was {{standing}} there, looking a little worried. His tone was almost apologetic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, really--" [...] I began. But I was {{interrupted}} by a sudden <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> both <b>the</b> Cave-man and the Cave-woman together: ...|$|R
5000|$|Saint Etienne {{recorded}} a demo dance track called [...] "Chase HQ" [...] that {{was inspired by}} Chase H.Q. It includes samples of the [...] "Oh man!" [...] and [...] "Punch <b>the</b> pedal!" [...] <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game action. The track was released as a bonus track on the 2009 Deluxe reissue of the band's 1991 album, Foxbase Alpha.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had been}} {{prepared}} for an outbreak or <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> man before her, but not for his cold silence. [...] "Speak," [...] she cried at last, passionately. [...] "Speak! Open your lips, if only to curse me! Order in your men to arrest me. I will proclaim myself guilty, and save your honor. But only speak!" ...|$|R
60|$|As he {{said this}} an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> elder chaouse drew his {{attention}} to the fact that Sidi Hassan himself had just turned the corner of the street in which they had been conversing, and was at that moment so earnestly engaged in conversation with Sidi Omar, that the two approached without at first observing the officers of justice.|$|R
60|$|He heard excited <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{quarters}} of the soldiers and he heard men running in his direction. They would seize him, and if they didn't kill him they would take him down the Congo {{to a point where}} a properly ordered military tribunal would do so just as effectively, though in a more regular manner.|$|R
6000|$|She was gone, {{while the}} three {{were still in the}} glad tangle of an embrace {{beginning}} again and again, with all sorts of little <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> children, into which Aurelia broke with the inquiry for their brother. [...] "He is much better," [...] said Fay. [...] "He is to get up to-morrow, and then he will come and find you." ...|$|R
60|$|An <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stairs {{made me look}} up. Audrey {{was leaning}} over the banisters. Her face was in the shadow, but I {{gathered}} from her voice that the sight of our little procession had startled her. I was not surprised. Buck was a distinctly startling spectacle, and his habit of growling to himself, as he walked, highly disturbing to strangers.|$|R
60|$|It was {{day when}} he awoke, and went on deck to find a heavy sea running, and just {{sufficient}} sail set to keep the schooner’s head before the wind as she bobbed about on <b>the</b> waters. An <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skipper, as a wave broke against the side and flung a cloud of spray over him, brought the mate’s head round.|$|R
50|$|The story {{revolves}} around seven animals {{who go to}} their veterinarian {{with the desire to}} change their lives. Each animal is granted their wish. Following a large storm, the animals return one by one, to recount their adventures, supplemented with dancing and <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chorus. The animals include a break dancing turtle, a horse {{who wants to be a}} 'rider', a dog who wants to howl like a wolf, and a goldfish who wants to swim in the Sea of Japan.|$|R
60|$|There was an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> {{within and}} <b>the</b> door {{suddenly}} opened.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{phrases and}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anime have become popular {{keywords}} on Twitter. The first episode of Kemono Friends, available for free on Niconico Douga, had 5 million views as of April 4 {{and has become}} the second most watched anime episode on the website, only behind the first episode of Is the Order a Rabbit? (8 million) and ahead of shows like Attack on Titan.|$|R
60|$|They {{were within}} {{a hundred yards}} of the Durham when Quest gave a little <b>exclamation.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} steamer another tug shot away, turning back towards New York. Huddled up in the stern, half {{concealed}} in a tarpaulin, was a man in a plain black suit. Quest, with a little shout, recognised the man at <b>the</b> helm <b>from</b> his long brown beard.|$|R
