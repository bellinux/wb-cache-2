Sometime later, Rose appears again and tells her that she needs Donna to come with her, but that doing so will result in Donna dying. Donna refuses, and Rose tells her {{that she will be}} back in three weeks. Three weeks later, Donna and Wilfred are using his telescope when they realise that the stars are disappearing from the sky. Rose appears and Donna is now convinced to go with her. Rose takes her to UNIT and explains that the stars are <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> every universe, and the fabric of reality is collapsing, allowing Rose to travel between universes.

25|$|Regarding state repressions, Stalin often {{provided}} conflicting signals. In May 1933, {{he ordered}} the release of many criminals convicted of minor offenses from the overcrowded prisons and ordered the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations. In September 1934, {{he ordered the}} Politburo to establish a commission to investigate any false imprisonments; however, that same month he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan. This began to change in December 1934, when the prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered. After the murder of Kirov, Stalin became increasingly attentive {{of the possibility of}} murder and subsequently improved his own personal security, including being heavily guarded at all times and rarely ever <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public on his own.|$|E
25|$|In zoology {{the term}} {{polygyny}} {{is used for}} to a pattern of mating in which a male animal {{has more than one}} female mate in a breeding season. Males get their mates by defending the females directly or holding resources that the females want and need. This is known as resource defense polygyny and males of the bee species Anthidium manicatum (also known as the European wool carder bee) exhibit this behavior. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the multiple females who forage in their territories. Males of many species attract females to their territory by either gathering in a lek or <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> search of dispersed females. In polygyny relationships in animals, the female is the one who provides most of the parental care for the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{women in}} Yemen {{traditionally}} wore branched pantaloons beneath their long black tunics. The pantaloons were usually {{made of a}} jet-black color, tapering close to their ankles, and decorated at the lower seams with a fine embroidered stitch of silver. The tunic served as, both, a dress and long-sleeved blouse, all in one piece. In addition, all young girls wore a black, conical shaped hat upon their heads, which took {{the place of a}} scarf. These hats were called in the local vernacular, gargoush, and were also decorated with an embroidered sash about its borders, besides being equipped with tapering flaps that extended down to the ears and to the nape of the neck. Older women in Sana'a would wear a broad veil-like scarf over their heads, called maswan, especially when <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> public places, and which was traditionally worn above the closer fitting scarves that covered their hair. All women were adorned with black slippers when walking in public places, and only very small girls would walk barefoot.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{guidance}} of new coach Winfried Schäfer, KSC's return to the top flight was marked with some success as {{for the first time}} the team managed to work its way out of the bottom half of the league table. In the 1993–94 season, the club had a successful run in the UEFA Cup, <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the semi-finals on away goals to Austria Salzburg after beating, in turn, PSV, Valencia, Bordeaux and Boavista. Their stunning 7–0 second-round victory over Valencia, a top team in the Spanish La Liga at the time and in historical terms as well, might be considered the high point of the club's history in its centennial year. Between 1992 and 1997, the club was ranked in the single digits in six consecutive Bundesliga seasons and also participated in two more UEFA Cups, reaching the third round both in the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons, being eliminated from the competition after losing their second-leg matches to Brøndby and Spartak Moscow respectively. In 1995, KSC won the DFB-Hallenpokal, an indoor football tournament that was traditionally held during winter breaks of the Bundesliga seasons. They also played in the final of the DFB-Pokal in 1996, but lost 0–1 to 1. FC Kaiserslautern.|$|E
