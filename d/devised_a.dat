5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.|$|E
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green.

When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E

He <b>devised</b> <b>a</b> simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E

He had an elder sister who died from breast cancer in 1988.

Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
