60|$|BERTLEY. No, no, we mustn't {{joke about}} it. [Gravely.] I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> should be spoken to.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all Peter's fault," [...] said Felicity. [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{might have}} had more sense than to take a clock {{striking}} for a bell ringing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Willoughby, anxiously, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{may have}} some intelligence! It is now more than a twelvemonth since we have seen Nick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>did</b> you <b>think</b> of his urging {{us to go}} to the race? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant it? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} it for an invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a hypocrite. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{sincerely}} {{believes that}} {{his duty to}} the Church requires him to behave as he does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't for {{a moment}} think, dearest, that what he said, made me uneasy as {{regarded}} you: but whom <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> selected for you--of whom <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is jealous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{can you be}} so disagreeable, Dolores, {{when you}} know it was all on business. Though I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is the most {{interesting}} man I ever did see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bryan, I {{think this}} man's book disgraceful; he simply runs his sex-idea to death. Really, we aren't all quite so obsessed as that. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to be}} put in his own lunatic asylum." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. B.--You are a kind, affectionate creature, Miss Prior. I do {{not very}} much like the gentleman who {{recommended}} you to Arabella, you know. But I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> sent my son a good governess for his children.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is hopeful? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad! <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can shirk his {{responsibility}} {{to his wife}} because she is my daughter? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think,</b> because his mother's father was a baronet, that he can put Henrietta aside the moment her society palls on him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As far as I could tell, he was happy," [...] said fellow Cracked artist Dan Clowes. [...] "I <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ever {{seemed to}} notice that Mad was respected, whereas Cracked was loathed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am to {{have four}} hundred and fifty," [...] said Amelia. [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have made it five hundred pounds. If I had it to give away, I never would show the cloven foot about the last fifty pounds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{could just}} colour it a little. It {{would be such}} a grand thing to get him away, and he in this miserable condition! If he were once on his travels, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would soon begin to forget it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{suppose you}} ought to have asked Aunt Jane's leave; but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be a ridiculous young man if he could not attend to his proper work because you did not go after him when you were only just come home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} about the lawsuit? I don't care for that! <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will hate {{me when he}} sees me? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will believe me when I tell him that I never meant to leave him, and that I'm sorry for what I did to drive him away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{why does}} he do it?' cried Ursula, 'why <b>does</b> <b>he?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> grand, when he's bullied a {{sensitive}} creature, ten times as sensitive as himself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> doing?" [...] {{asked the}} King, as the bearded one slowly raised the hoe above his right shoulder, {{slightly}} bending the left knee {{as he did}} so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But one {{can hardly}} {{expect him to}} reduce at once. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is sincere in his promises, but he will be careless, even in {{ordinary}} expenditure. I don't say this is what ought to be, but I fear it will be. All the prudence and self-denial must be upon her side.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Frink whispered, [...] "Hope the doc {{gives the}} strikers hell! Ordinarily, I don't {{believe in a}} preacher butting into {{political}} matters--let him stick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir {{up a lot of}} discussion--but at a time like this, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought to stand right up and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} that will do no good. It will not be for the first time. Lady Conway has been his dread {{from the time of}} his own marriage; and if she should come to Northwold, he will be in despair. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be right; she must be making a dead set at Louis.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't?' cried Miss Petowker, really showing great {{capability}} for the stage. 'Oh, <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> Lillyvick {{will always remember}} it--always, always, always?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Pen, with a laugh, said [...] "that at {{one time}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was pretty well in Miss Amory's good graces. But my mother did not like her, and the affair went off." [...] Pen <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> it fit to tell his uncle all the {{particulars}} of that courtship which had passed {{between himself and the}} young lady.|$|R
60|$|Elinor {{agreed to}} it all, for she <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{deserved}} the compliment of rational opposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, Cox," [...] said Miss Palliser, as {{they passed}} by the pack. [...] "Poor Mr. Maule! I did pity him, and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does care for it, though he is so impassive. He would be with us now, only he is chewing the cud of his {{unhappiness}} in solitude half a mile behind us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! little woman, don't {{talk about}} that. He had his faults, dear, {{as we all}} have, {{but he had a}} great deal to worry him, and perhaps we did not make {{allowances}} enough for him, and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was really fond of you, Lucy, and when people are dead we should never speak ill of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! this pestilent toe!" [...] groaned the sufferer. [...] "Sir William won't hear of my moving yet. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is {{the most}} {{completely}} obstinate and pig-headed man that I have ever met. I {{tell him that he}} has mistaken his profession, and that I could find him a post at Constantinople. We need a mule out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|But again, we {{read that}} the Spirit of God takes of the things of Christ, and shows them unto us. And what are the things of Christ? They must be eternal things, {{unchangeable}} things, for Christ is unchangeable--Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. He is over all, God blessed for ever. To Him all power is given in heaven and earth. He reigns, and He will reign. <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less a Saviour now, than He was when He spoke those things to John's disciples? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less able to hear and to help than He was in John's time? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>He</b> used to care about people's bodies then, but that He only cares about their souls now? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> is less compassionate, and less merciful, as well as less powerful, than He was when He made the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, in Judaea of old? ...|$|R
60|$|Betty studied him. She <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw {{the light}} he had given her. Sometimes Kit was dull.|$|R
5000|$|... "Who <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was! The colonel Anabal√≥n {{teaching}} manners to my heroism, like {{an elephant}} pulling his beard at the world, and, {{on top of}} that, the mother in law hairy and metaphoric as the gallows." ...|$|R
60|$|By getting ashore {{half a mile}} {{above the}} creek, there was a farm-road {{that would lead to}} the house by a cut so short, as nearly to bring us there as soon as Neb could {{possibly}} arrive with his dire, but false intelligence. The place was pointed out to the captain, who had extracted our secret from us, and who good-naturedly consented to do all we asked of him. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have gone into the creek itself, had it been required. But we were landed, with our bag of clothes--one answered very well for both--at the place I have mentioned, and, taking turn about to shoulder the wardrobe, away we went, as fast as legs could carry us. Even Rupert seemed to feel on this occasion, and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had a good deal of contrition, as he must have recollected the pain he had occasioned his excellent father, and dear, good sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think, Master Lirriper?" [...] Geoffrey exclaimed as {{they joined}} him. [...] "We have asked Mr. Vere {{to take us}} with him as pages {{to the war in}} the Low Country, and though he said we were not to be hopeful about his reply, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will take us. We are to go round to Westminster at one o'clock to see him again. What do you think of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{it is very}} sad; but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will be a better, more steadfast man: he has learnt his weakness, {{and where}} to find strength, as he never had before. And {{the effect on the}} school is remarkable. That there should be so much {{tenderness}} of conscience and apprehension of the guilt of impurity among the children of the heathen in among many brought up in familiarity with sin, is a matter for much thankfulness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> never will, eh, mother?" [...] What could Mrs. Bell say? In {{her heart}} of hearts she <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ever would come again.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Hunt", a fifth season {{episode of}} the TV series Castle, when Richard Castle's {{daughter}} Alexis is kidnapped and taken to Paris, Castle follows and Det. Kevin Ryan asks, [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is, Liam Neeson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] The All-seeing knows, [...] I <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had {{a living}} Child.-- [...] But whither did you carry him? ...|$|R
