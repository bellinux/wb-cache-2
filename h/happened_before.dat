5|$|James was presumably an Italian, {{like the}} other members of the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth and of his arrival in Britain are unknown. He went with Paulinus to Northumbria {{accompanying}} Æthelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> 619.|$|E

5|$|Romanus {{died before}} 627, {{probably}} about 625. He {{drowned in the}} Mediterranean Sea off Italy while {{on a mission to}} Rome for Justus. Presumably this <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> Justus' death in 627. He was certainly dead by 633, when Paulinus of York became bishop at Rochester after fleeing Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons. Most importantly, an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring. The full floods could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it was unlikely to have <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the end of the Balkans Campaign.|$|E

5|$|All six {{boats were}} {{completed}} from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata (BSO) in Split, SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia: Tisa (P-911), Una (P-912), Zeta (P-913), Soča (P-914), Kupa (P-915) and Vardar (P-916). Further planned improvements included {{the addition of}} a Stirling engine, either by refitting the existing boats or building a new, seventh one, but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> anything was realized.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he claimed}} he was {{reluctant}} to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first Liberal elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had never <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b> He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|Most of the highest-scoring games <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the 1995–96 season, {{when the}} average scoring (points per game) per team {{was always in}} the 100s. Since that season, the average has dropped down to the 90s. Only two post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7, 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively, both of whom also made use of the run and gun style.|$|E

5|$|These {{provisions}} covered both Cartledge-like {{situations and}} {{cases where the}} injured party, while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until {{more than three years}} after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the Act came into force if an action had not been brought. If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself.|$|E
5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{covers the}} story of Devil May Cry 4, and the events that <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> it. It expands Nero's backstory as it is {{revealed}} he was abandoned in Fortuna when he was baby. An unidentified character (strongly hinted to be Dante's brother Vergil) following Sparda's footsteps also appears in the novel first in a flashback when Nero was found in Fortuna {{as well as in}} a dream before Nero wields Yamato for the first time. During the novel Nero is often compared with Vergil; Dante is unable to understand the connection between the two. The ending is also expanded as Nero opens his own demon hunting business after the Order of the Sword. In the afterword, Bingo wrote that these removed scenes were intended {{to be included in the}} game, but were not due to some production reasons.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> she goes.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
