He addressed the publication to The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community. In it he wrote This is an urgent warning to each and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> {{that there is a}} careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{included on the}} DVD release of The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Lee said of his friend's death: [...] "I don't want to sound gloomy, {{but at some point}} of your lives, <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will notice that you have in your life one person, one friend whom you love and care for very much. That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 2, {{the second of}} the two cutters, with an occupancy of 25 people was overseen by Wilde and Smith at about 1:45a.m. When Lightoller moved to the boat to get it ready for loading, he found that it was already filled with a large group of male passengers and crewmen. He ordered them out at gunpoint, telling them, [...] "Get out of there, you damned cowards! I'd like to see <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> overboard!" [...] They fled, but {{had no way of knowing}} that his revolver was not loaded. Even at this late stage some boats were leaving with plenty of space aboard; Boat 2 appears to have been lowered with only 17 people aboard, out of a capacity of 40. The occupants were principally women, plus one male Third Class passenger, Anton Kink, who joined his wife and young daughter in the boat. Fourth Officer Boxhall was given charge of the boat.|$|E

2500|$|Active in over 40 countries, ALF cells operate clandestinely, {{consisting}} of {{small groups of}} friends and sometimes just one person, which makes the movement difficult for the authorities to monitor.
