5|$|I-69 in Michigan {{begins at}} the Indiana state line {{southeast}} of Kinderhook and just north of an interchange with the Indiana Toll Road, which carries I-80 and I-90. From there, I-69 runs northward through a mixture of Southern Michigan farmland and woodland in Branch County. A few {{miles north of the}} state line, the freeway passes Coldwater Lake State Park and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> center for the northbound lanes. I-69 curves around the east side of Coldwater, connecting to the city's business loop on the south of town. Immediately east of downtown, the freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop at an interchange that also features US12 (Chicago Road). Farther north, the freeway turns to the northwest, crosses into Calhoun County and then over the St. Joseph River. I-69 turns back northward and bypasses Tekonsha to the town's west, intersecting M-60 in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{business}} loop for Clare splits {{from the}} main freeway south of the city, {{and it is also}} signed to provide access to eastbound US10 via Bus. US10, which US127 crosses just south of the Clare County line. North of this line, US10 and US127 meet at a directional interchange. Ttraffic from westbound US10 defaults onto northbound US127, and traffic from the southbound freeway can exit onto eastbound US10; no other direct connections are provided between the two freeways, requiring the use of the business loops through downtown to make the missing connections. The freeway rounds Lake Shamrock north of downtown and intersections the joint northern end of two business loops. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> center in the median of US127/US10 before the two highways separate north of the city.|$|E

25|$|Reactions to PubMed Central {{among the}} {{scholarly}} publishing community range between a genuine enthusiasm by some, to cautious concern by others. While PMC <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> partner to open access publishers {{in its ability}} to augment the discovery and dissemination of biomedical knowledge, that same truth causes others to worry about traffic being diverted from the published version-of-record, the economic consequences of less readership, as well as the effect on maintaining a community of scholars within learned societies. Libraries, universities, open access supporters, consumer health advocacy groups, and patient rights organizations have applauded PubMed Central, and hope to see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support.|$|E

500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I get done playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|The case met a mixed {{reaction}} from academics. Jill Martin, {{in an article}} in the Conveyancer and Property Lawyer, argued that the case was [...] "fair, sensible and workable... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> example of the court's policy of preventing a clearly intended trust from failing for uncertainty". Alison Jones, in a different article for the same journal, said that [...] "Logically the decision in Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one", but noted that it did create [...] "difficult questions". Other academics were more critical, with David Hayton writing in the Law Quarterly Review that [...] "the unreserved judgment of Dillon LJ.... may well come to be stigmatised".|$|E
500|$|Ian Christie, {{writing in}} the Daily Express, {{said that it was}} not [...] "much of a plot, but it has a touch of {{credibility}} which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> change from some of its predecessors." [...] Overall, Christie thought, For Your Eyes Only was [...] "one of the better Bonds, with a nice balance between humour and excitement and the usual bevy of beautiful girls." [...] Christie's colleague in the Sunday Express, Richard Barkley praised the film, saying that For Your Eyes Only [...] "is {{one of the most exciting}} yet". Barkley describes Moore's Bond as having an [...] "accustomed debonair calm and quiet authority". All told, Barkley thought [...] "this Bond movie is smashing entertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Counterfeit", Gutierrez wrote that [...] "...despite {{the fact that}} the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back {{overriding}} his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting. [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> sound, too, because it means he's keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, [...] "Man, we're {{going to be all right}} tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|During the show's third season, the New York Post Robert Rorke deemed Izzie to be [...] "the {{heart and}} soul" [...] of Grey's Anatomy. He deemed her the show's heroine, and wrote that: [...] "Izzie <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome,</b> calming presence, despite the devastation she {{experienced}} when {{she failed to}} save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette. [...] Besides the formidable Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Izzie {{seems to be the}} only adult intern at Seattle Grace; the character has achieved a depth lacking in her fellow interns." [...] Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she [...] "should not be practising medicine" [...] and stating: [...] "That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned." ...|$|E

500|$|Film review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 57% based on reviews from 136 critics. The site summarized the consensus: [...] "Although Becoming Jane is a well-crafted period piece, it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen. The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen's achievements." [...] The New York Times called the film a [...] "triumph" [...] for Hathaway, but observed that [...] "the screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy [...] threatens to derail the film." [...] More positive, Entertainment Weekly called the film [...] "a charmer," [...] articulating that [...] "the supporting cast (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell) is top-drawer; and Anne Hathaway, with her coltish beauty and frank demeanor, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> Jane." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{also notes}} that Mara's {{surprising}} naivete <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> respite {{against a backdrop of}} a [...] "terminally jaded" [...] cast. As the show begins, aspiring journalist Zoe Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the [...] "Fairfax County Council" [...] beat to covering [...] "'what's behind the veil' of power in the Capitol hallways." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes {{that by the end of}} the first episode, Mara's Barnes is among the cadre of Frank's accomplices. After she pleads for a relationship with him by promising to earn his trust and not [...] "ask any questions", Frank uses her fiendishly. However, Ashley Parker of The New York Times considers her unfathomably aggressive and too overt, transactional and sexual. Parker points out that Barnes' statement [...] "I protect your identity, I print what you tell me, and I'll never ask any questions" [...] almost discredits itself.|$|E
500|$|Official Xbox Magazine {{gave the}} game a 4.5 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 10, stating, [...] "Whether you're swinging a pipe or a scalpel, the controls never feel responsive, and rotten collision detection will drive you mad before Jigsaw's twisted games even have the chance." [...] David Clayman, writer for IGN, gave Saw a 7.5 {{out of a possible}} ten, earning it a rating of [...] "Good". Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills. Depending on your tolerance for repetition, it's a good way to test your nerves and scare yourself silly during a dark and stormy night.|$|E

500|$|Reception of {{the soundtrack}} was {{generally}} positive from critics. IGN praised the soundtrack for its wide use of instruments stating, [...] "Where other videogame scores tend to miss their mark when combining electronic and organic elements, O'Donnell and Salvatori {{seem to have}} found a rather stable balance between the two divergent sounds." [...] Adding, overall, the soundtrack is [...] "one of the better videogame oriented musical experiences out there" [...] and playing the game is not required to find enjoyment within the score. Reviewing for Monsters At Play, Michael Johnson called the soundtrack [...] "66 minutes of orchestral goodness" [...] citing the wide range of music covered as a strong point. Nuketown gave the soundtrack [...] 9 out of 10, stating, [...] "the soundtrack <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> and invigorating reminder of good times had blasting unstoppable alien hordes". The release went on to sell over 40,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|The {{collection}} {{also received}} a review from University of Geneva postdoctoral research fellow in the faculty of law, Steven J. Barela, in the Journal of International Criminal Justice. Barela described the book as [...] "a constructive work with a wide purview {{onto one of the}} most pressing and difficult policy questions of our time". He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, [...] "In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners." [...] University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, [...] "Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict". He concluded, [...] " [...] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group".|$|E
500|$|Joystiq {{was very}} {{positive}} towards the improved multiplayer matchmaking service, calling it [...] "similar to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> {{change from the}} archaic matchmaking of Battle.net in previous Blizzard games", while GameSpot called the amount of online content [...] "remarkable", noting the variety of maps and up to 12 player online support. When comparing the single and multiplayer modes, GameSpy felt that the single-player portion was [...] "less inspiring, mostly because of the extremely shallow learning curve", with the online multiplayer being [...] "so smooth, so challenging, and so much plain-old-fun". John Meyer of Wired praised the improved graphics engine, saying that it [...] "shows decades of polish" [...] and a [...] "slick new presentation". Matt Peckham of PC World also noted that some buyers expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of LAN-based multiplayer gameplay, the lack of cross-realm play and the campaign being limited to the Terran race. Game Revolution, in relation to only being able to play the Terran campaign, however, pointed out that [...] "Wings of Liberty has 29 missions; the original StarCraft had just over 30. Fair odds say the next one will have roughly the same amount; Broodwar brought about 30 too. We already got the full game for $50, and we’re getting offered two expansions. If you want to feel outraged about something, pick something else." ...|$|E
