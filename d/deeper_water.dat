5000|$|The three <b>deep</b> <b>waters</b> {{consist of}} the Greenland Sea <b>Deep</b> <b>Water,</b> Norwegian Sea <b>Deep</b> <b>Water,</b> and the Arctic Ocean <b>Deep</b> <b>Water.</b> The Greenland Sea <b>Deep</b> <b>Water</b> has a {{temperature}} of approximately -1.8 °C and a salinity of 34.895 psu. This water mass is formed by deep convection that occurs intermittently in the Greenland gyre. The Arctic Ocean <b>Deep</b> <b>Water</b> is approximately 34.92 psu. This water mass has a higher salinity due to brine rejection in the Arctic Seas. The depth is around 1500 and 2000 meters.

40|$|Until {{the eighties}} {{the main source}} of <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> masses in the Ionian Basin was the {{southern}} Adriatic Sea. During the nineties a dramatic climatic change took place in the eastern Mediterranean (Eastern Mediterranean Transient); <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> was formed of water originating from the Aegean Sea since then. This change in the <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> had extensive consequences for the whole circulation of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Expeditions carried out in this region during the last years indicate now that the process of <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> formation might reverse again. The process of this re-reversing <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> formation is a long-term one. Therefore, the characteristics of the today's <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> masses in the Ionian Basin, to which extent these characteristics differ from the <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> masses before the EMT and in which state the re-reversed Eastern Mediterranean <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> circulation is now, must be investigated continuously. The Adriatic <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> finds its way to the Ionian Basin on several routes with different entrainments rates. The entrainment rates might be a deciding factor for the <b>Deep</b> Ionian <b>Waters</b> and the resulting density might influence the role of the Aegean <b>Deep</b> <b>Water</b> for the Ionian <b>Deep</b> <b>Waters</b> as well. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and quantify the routes and entrainment rates of the Adriatic <b>Deep</b> <b>Water.</b> The cruise carried out is a continuation of the work carried out during the cruises POS 298, M 71 / 3, MSM 13 / 2, MSM 15 / 4 and M 84 / 3. The objective is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of dispersion and mixing of the Ionian <b>Deep</b> <b>Water.</b> During the cruise CTD stations were carried out and samples for nutrient, oxygen and oxygen isotopes were taken. Continously measurements were made with the vessel mounted ADCP and thermosalinograph. Additionally, on the cruise students were trained on the use of oceanographic equipment...|$|R

5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in <b>deeper</b> <b>water,</b> requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish.

In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items.

In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in <b>deeper</b> <b>water.</b> Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E

Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in <b>deeper</b> <b>water.</b> When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare {{physiological}} responses between runners adapted and not adapted to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running at maximal intensity and the intensity equivalent to the ventilatory threshold. Seventeen runners, either adapted (n = 10) or not adapted (n = 7) to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running, participated in the study. Participants in both groups undertook a maximal treadmill running and <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running graded exercise test in which cardiorespiratory variables were measured. Interactions between adaptation (adapted vs. non-adapted) and condition (treadmill running vs. <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running) were analysed. The main effects of adaptation and condition were also analysed in isolation. Runners adapted to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running experienced less of a reduction in maximum oxygen consumption ([Vdot]O 2 max) in <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running compared with treadmill running than runners not adapted to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running. Maximal oxygen consumption, maximal heart rate, maximal ventilation, [Vdot]O 2 at the ventilatory threshold, heart rate at the ventilatory threshold, and ventilation at the ventilatory threshold were significantly higher during treadmill than <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running. Therefore, we conclude that adaptation to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running reduces the difference in [Vdot]O 2 max between the two modalities, possibly due to an increase in muscle recruitment. The results of this study support previous findings of a lower maximal and submaximal physiological response on <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> running for most of the measured parameters...|$|R
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in <b>deeper</b> <b>water.</b> If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The Ekman {{divergence}} around Antarctica {{raises a}} large amount of <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> to the ocean’s surface. The regional Ekman transport moves the upwclled <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> northward out of the circumpolar zone. The divergence and northward surface drift combine, in effect, to remove <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> from the interior of the ocean. This wind-driven removal process is facilitated by a unique dynamic constraint operating in the latitude band containing Drake Passage. Through a simple model sensitivity experiment WC show that the upwelling and removal of <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> in the circumpolar belt may be quantitatively related to the formation of new <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> in the northern North Atlantic. These results shoţhat stronger winds in the south can induct more <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> formation in the north and more deep outflow through the South Atlantic.

40|$|In the South Atlantic and {{adjoining}} Southern Ocean the kaolinite/chlorite-ratio in Late Quaternary sediments are {{an alternative}} <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> proxy to benthic foraminiferal proxies and carbonate preservation indices {{that is even}} suitable in regions with poor carbonate preservation. This paper shows the relationship between modern abyssal circulation and the kaolinite/chloriteratio and presents reconstructions of <b>deep</b> and bottom <b>water</b> advection based on the kaolinite/ chlorite proxy. We also discuss the limitations and future perspectives of the kaolinite/chlorite proxy. Latitudinal and water depth-related patterns of the kaolinite/chlorite-ratio in surface sediments correspond to the modern <b>deep</b> and bottom <b>water</b> mass distribution. Kaolinite originates from lowlatitudes and traces North Atlantic <b>Deep</b> <b>Water</b> (northern-source <b>deep</b> <b>water)</b> advection to the south. Chlorite from the southern high-latitudes is exported via northward advecting Antarctic Bottom <b>Water</b> and Circumpolar <b>Deep</b> <b>Water</b> (southern-source <b>deep</b> and bottom <b>water).</b> Deep-sea sedimentation in regions underlying the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was current-dominated throughout the Late Quaternary. Temporal variations of the kaolinite/chlorite-ratio in response to glacial-interglacial cycles reflect changing <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> mass configurations, suggesting a shallowing and northward retreat of northern-source <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> and accordingly wider expansion of southernsource <b>deep</b> and bottom <b>water</b> masses during glacial times relative to interglacial times.

5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} <b>deeper</b> <b>water</b> than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E
5|$|Primarily nocturnal, nursehounds {{spend the}} day inside small holes in rocks and swim into <b>deeper</b> <b>water</b> at night to hunt.

5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into <b>deeper</b> <b>water.</b> The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{appearance}} of mature abyssal plains {{results from the}} blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt.
