Major Wickord sent Company B, {{commanded}} by Captain Donald Hanes, ahead, most likely as an advanced guard. During B company's advance, they had planned to refuel their gasoline powered M3's at <b>Gerona</b> and then again at Bauang. However, upon reaching <b>Gerona,</b> no fuel was available, and word reached Captain Hanes that the enemy was fast approaching Bauang.|$|E
25|$|Chabran and Schwarz were {{defeated}} at the Battles of the Bruch in mid-June and Duhesme was repulsed in the Battle of <b>Gerona</b> on 2021 June. After securing {{the assistance of}} an improvised division commanded by General of Division Honoré Charles Reille, Duhesme initiated the Siege of <b>Gerona.</b> This unsuccessful operation lasted from 24 July to 16 August before Duhesme retreated to Barcelona and Reille withdrew to Figueres. News of the French disaster at the Battle of Bailen on 22 July 1808 buoyed Spanish morale and depressed the Imperial troops. Duhesme's troops had to fight their way back through the hills and abandon their field artillery {{in order to make}} it back to Barcelona, where they arrived on 20 August.|$|E

25|$|Over time, the {{approach}} of the Tosafists spread to other Jewish communities, particularly those in Spain. This led to the composition of many other commentaries in similar styles. Among these are the commentaries of Nachmanides (Ramban), Solomon ben Adret (Rashba), Yom Tov of Seville (Ritva) and Nissim of <b>Gerona</b> (Ran). A comprehensive anthology consisting of extracts from all these is the Shittah Mekubbetzet of Bezalel Ashkenazi.|$|E

25|$|According to a 5 November report, the Army of Catalonia under Vives had 20,033 {{soldiers}} {{available in}} five divisions {{and a small}} reserve. Brigadier General Mariano Álvarez de Castro led 5,600 soldiers of the Vanguard Division. The Vanguard included 100 cavalry in the volunteer San Narciso Hussars, the regular foot regiments of Ultonia Irish (300), Borbon (500), 2nd Barcelona (1,000), and 1st Wimpfen Swiss (400), and the volunteer tercios 1st <b>Gerona</b> (900), 2nd <b>Gerona</b> (400), Igualada (400), Cervera (400), 1st Tarragona (800), and Figueras (400). General Conde de Caldagues commanded the 4,998-strong 1st Division which consisted of six artillery pieces manned by 70 gunners, 50 sappers, the cavalry regiments Españoles Hussars (220) and Catalonia Cazadores (180), the regular infantry regiments the 2nd Walloon Guards (314), Soria (780), Borbon (151), 2nd Savoia (1,734), and 2nd Swiss (270), and the volunteer tercios Tortosa (984) and elements of Igualada and Cervera (245). General Laguna supervised the 2,360-man 2nd Division with seven guns manned by 84 artillerists, 30 sappers, Españoles Hussars (200), two battalions each of provincial grenadier militia of Old Castile (972) and New Castile (924), and the Zaragoza Volunteers (150).|$|E

25|$|By late 1813, Suchet's {{forces in}} Catalonia {{numbered}} 46,000 men. His field force included General of Division Louis François Félix Musnier's 3,561-man 1st Division, General of Brigade Claude Marie Joseph de Valdotte Pannetier's 3,073-strong 2nd Division, Mathieu's 2,373-man 3rd Division, Habert's 3,975-strong 4th Division, General of Division Jean Maximilien Lamarque's 4,205-man 5th Division, 2,501 cavalry, and 3,000 gunners and others. The French had 9,493 troops in garrisons at Tortosa, Lleida, and Sagunto, 1,605 at <b>Gerona,</b> 1,742 at Figueras, 5,844 at Barcelona, and 4,918 at smaller fortresses.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 1808, 200 Imperial French {{soldiers}} {{asked to}} be admitted within the precincts of the fortress and were allowed in, since the French {{were believed to be}} allies. Once inside, they seized the main gate and opened it to an entire regiment. The stunned Spanish garrison was quickly expelled. Since its capture, the French had used Sant Ferran as a major supply base for the sieges of Roses in 1808 and <b>Gerona</b> in 1809. But after three years, the French generals grew complacent and in April 1811 the key fort was only held by an Italian provisional battalion.|$|E
25|$|Thwarted at Roses, Reille {{moved in}} the {{direction}} of Girona. When he reached there, he joined with Duhesme to initiate the Siege of <b>Gerona.</b> Meanwhile, 5,000 Spanish regular troops from the Balearic Islands commanded by the Marquis Del Palacio landed at Tarragona. Appointed Captain General of Catalonia, Del Palacio joined his regulars with a large mass of Catalan irregulars to start a blockade of Barcelona on 1 August 1808. Lechi's 3,500-man Italo-Swiss garrison defended the city. Among a large population that threatened to revolt at any moment, Lechi began sending alarming reports to Duhesme after being compelled to abandon his outposts, such as the castle of Mongat.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Cuba {{erected a}} model penitentiary of panopticon design on the {{outskirts}} of Nueva <b>Gerona,</b> Presidio Modelo, 1926 and 1928. Cuban leader Fidel Castro, after leading the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks July 1953, was imprisoned in it from 1953 to 1955 by the regime of Fulgencio Batista, as was his brother Raul. Following the Cuban Revolution, the same facility was used to imprison the new regime's enemies and political dissidents. They included Huber Matos, an officer in the revolutionary army who attempted to resign and who said he was tortured there, and Armando Valladares, who wrote a memoir describing the prison's harsh conditions and cruel treatment of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners.|$|E
25|$|After being {{stationed}} in northern France in Artois {{and on the}} Saône, the regiment was sent to fight in Catalonia in the War of the Reunions, fighting along the river Ter and in Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds' siege of <b>Gerona.</b> The Grand Condé died on 11 December 1688, leaving his princely title and regiments to his son Henri Jules. The regiment had been sent east already, where it fought in all the campaigns of the War of the League of Augsburg, in Flanders, on the Moselle, and on the Rhine. It fought with distinction at the Battle of Fleurus on 1 July 1690 and the Battle of Neerwinden on 29 July 1693, and fought in the 1697 siege of Ath, the final battle of the war.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{his plan}} to {{overthrow}} the Spanish ruling family, Emperor Napoleon I ordered his soldiers to seize Barcelona in February 1808. The city's fortress was successfully occupied, but {{a few weeks later}} the Spanish people rebelled against Imperial French rule. Duhesme and his soldiers soon found themselves in difficulties. Hemmed in by Catalan militia and regular Spanish troops, the French general attempted to capture Girona in order to open up a secure supply line from France to Barcelona. The Franco-Italian force attempted to storm the city but they were repulsed by the city militia and two small battalions of Irish regular infantry in Spanish service. Duhesme fell back to Barcelona, but he returned to mount the Second Siege of <b>Gerona</b> five weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Duhesme {{retreated to}} Barcelona, leaving Chabran and a brigade to hold Mataró. Soon after, Duhesme {{attacked}} {{a force of}} miquelets along the Llobregat River and drove them away. Chabran tried to entice the Catalan militia into battle but was unsuccessful. Finally becoming aware of Duhesme's troubles, Napoleon earmarked a newly formed division under General of Division Honoré Charles Reille to reinforce him. Reille moved out with an advanced guard and soon relieved the garrison of Sant Ferran Castle at Figueras. After assembling his whole division, Reille moved against the port of Roses, but was rebuffed by its defenders and the British battleship HMS Montagu (74), which landed its marines to help. Hearing about the division of reinforcements, Duhesme prepared for a new attempt on Girona. The next action was the First Siege of <b>Gerona.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sent to Spain in 1808 {{in command}} of German troops, Amey fought at the Third Siege of <b>Gerona</b> the {{following}} year. In 1812 he participated in the French invasion of Russia and led his troops at the First and Second Battles of Polotsk. He was promoted to general of division and fought at the Berezina. He fought at Arnhem in fall 1813. While leading a division of recruits, he was wounded and captured after a heroic defense in the Battle of Fère-Champenoise in 1814. After rallying to Napoleon during the Hundred Days he was retired in 1815. He served as mayor of Sélestat for ten years then returned to military service in 1830–1833. His surname {{is one of the}} names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 1.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 Lloréns, one of {{the leading}} Levantine Carlists, got elected to the Congress of Deputies from Castellón as {{one of the}} first Traditionalist deputies of the Restoration era. In course of his first tenure he {{actively}} engaged in defence of regional establishments during , an attempt on part of the Liberal government to modernise the administration and scrap the 1841 semi-autonomous fiscal Navarrese establishments; he was the only non-Navarrese deputy to vote against the proposal. 12 years later he was rewarded with the title of Navarrese hijo adoptivo in return. In 1896 he successfully ran from the Catalan <b>Gerona</b> and was re-elected from the same constituency in 1898. In 1899 the claimant Carlos VII decided not to field an official list permitting only individual candidatures, but Lloréns was engaged in staging insurgency rather than running for the parliament he just planned to overthrow.|$|E
25|$|With Roses {{out of the}} way, Saint-Cyr {{was free}} to direct his {{energies}} to the relief of Barcelona. After assigning Reille to hold Figueras and Roses {{and to protect the}} roads from France, Saint-Cyr had about 1,500 horsemen and 15,000 foot soldiers in three divisions of 26 total battalions. Girona (<b>Gerona)</b> stood squarely in the path that the French army would have to take. The French general knew that besieging Girona was out of the question; in the time it would take to capture the place, Barcelona would be starved out. Once past Girona, there were two available roads. Knowing that the coast road via Mataró was obstructed and could easily be placed under the guns of the British Royal Navy, Saint-Cyr chose to use the inland road. In order for his plan to work, the Imperial general hoped to keep Vives guessing as to his true intentions and to defeat his opponent in detail.|$|E
25|$|With much of Spain in open revolt, Napoleon {{established}} a headquarters at Bayonne on the Spanish frontier to reorganize his beleaguered forces and redress the situation. Having little {{respect for his}} Spanish opponents, the Emperor decided that a swift display of force would cow the insurgents and quickly consolidate his control of Spain. To this end, Napoleon dispatched a number of flying columns to throttle the rebellion by seizing and pacifying Spain's major cities: from Madrid, Marshal Bessières pushed northwest into Old Castile with 25,000 men and sent a detachment east into Aragón, aiming to capture Santander {{with one hand and}} Zaragoza with the other; General Moncey marched toward Valencia with 29,350 men; and General Duhesme marshalled 12,710 troops in Catalonia and put <b>Gerona</b> under siege. Finally, General Dupont, a distinguished field commander, was to lead 13,000 men south toward Seville and ultimately the port of Cádiz, which sheltered Admiral François Rosilly's fleet from the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|Suchet's army {{arrived in}} front of Lérida on 15 April. The 13,000 French {{soldiers}} were organized into 18 battalions and eight squadrons and supplied with 30 artillery pieces. Musnier's 2nd Division included three battalions each of the 114th, 115th, and 121st Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the 1st Legion of the Vistula, and two foot artillery batteries. Habert's 3rd Division comprised two battalions each of the 5th Light and 116th Line, three battalions of the 117th Line, and two foot artillery batteries. Boussart's cavalry {{was made up of}} the 4th Hussar and 13th Cuirassier Regiments, and a horse artillery battery. The fortress of Lérida was armed with 105 cannons. Major General Jaime García Conde led the 8,000 Spanish defenders, including 350 gunners. In September 1809, García Conde successfully led a 4,000-man re-supply convoy during the Siege of <b>Gerona.</b> During the operation he broke through the Italian defenders and delivered supplies and reinforcements before escaping.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of its 20th anniversary on 14 April 1968, British Eagle ranked fourth among the five major {{contemporary}} UK airlines (behind BEA, BOAC and BUA, and ahead of Caledonian). The airline's 24 aircraft included eight jets, six of which had been acquired direct from their manufacturers. These included a Boeing 707-365C leased out to MEA and five BAC One-Eleven 300 series. Kleinwort Benson were the owners of the 707-365C and two second-hand -138Bs that had been acquired from Qantas, while Kuwait Finance Agency, the overseas investment arm of the Kuwait government, and British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) respectively owned three and two of the five One-Elevens. British Eagle operated all of these aircraft under lease purchase agreements with the owners. By that time, the company's scheduled service network included routes from London Heathrow to Liverpool, Glasgow, Newquay, Luxembourg, Dinard, La Baule, Lourdes, Perpignan, <b>Gerona,</b> Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza, Pisa, Rimini, Stuttgart, Innsbruck, Djerba and Tunis. The firm also operated a large number of inclusive tour flights from Heathrow and other British airports. Lunn Poly was its largest tour operator customer.|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 1808, Napoleon named Amey a Baron of the Empire with an {{endowment}} of 4,000 French francs. His {{first wife}} Anne Marguerite Élisabeth Hantzler died that same day. In January 1809 he took {{command of the}} German Legion in the VII Corps' 1st Division in Catalonia and fought at the Third Siege of <b>Gerona.</b> In Jean-Antoine Verdier's 4th Division, he led the German brigade which consisted of the Würzburg and the 1st and 2nd Berg Regiments. The Spanish defenders resisted heroically and losses were horrific. During the siege the Würzburgers lost 870 casualties out of 1,519, the 1st Berg lost 605 out of 1,310 and the 2nd Berg lost 709 out of 1,313 men. After months of siege the French-Allied besiegers captured the key City Redoubt and on 7 December 1809, the Spanish garrison mounted an all-out attack to recapture the work. This completely failed and resulted in the additional loss of the Calvary and Chapter redoubts. The disaster led to the garrison's final surrender on 11 December. From his position near Montjuich, Amey launched the counterattack which took the Spanish in flank and overran the two redoubts.|$|E
25|$|In the Spanish Netherlands Luxembourg {{still had}} 100,000 men; {{but he was}} outnumbered. Lacking {{sufficient}} supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and, on 27 September 1694, recapturing Huy, an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur. Elsewhere, de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October; while in Italy, the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat's push into Piedmont. However, in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful. On 27 May Marshal Noailles, supported by French warships, soundly defeated the Marquis of Escalona's Spanish forces at the Battle of Torroella {{on the banks of}} the river Ter; the French proceeded to take Palamós on 10 June, <b>Gerona</b> on 29 June, and Hostalric, opening the route to Barcelona. With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for action. Part of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe, Saint-Malo, Le Havre, and Calais. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxería's miquelets. By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years.|$|E
