25|$|Levine's elbow problem {{continued}} into 2014. By July 2014 {{he was back}} to hitting on practice courts, and though his elbow was troubling him when serving he trained during the summer with Andy Murray. He was chosen as a hitting partner for Canada's Davis Cup team in September. However, when he attempted {{to come back in}} October after not playing competitively for 11 months, the problem recurred and was re-aggravated during a match in Houston. Levine was scheduled to have surgery in October 2014, either Tommy John surgery or a different surgery to move his ulnar nerve and thus relieve the numbness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> finger.|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Little</b> Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) {{reasoned}} that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected {{the light of the}} former. His non-religious view of the heavens was one cause for his imprisonment and eventual exile. [...] <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> book On the Face in the Moon's Orb, Plutarch suggested that the Moon had deep recesses in which the light of the Sun did not reach and that the spots are nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms. He also entertained the possibility that the Moon was inhabited.|$|E

Even if I took one of these over-sexed types who could not act, it would change how the Powell {{character}} is drawn into the affair. Remember the point of the script was that he's just a middle-level insurance investigator. He's tired of his job, spending time <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> office with a drab secretary. So I could have made a different picture, with a prettier girl than Lizabeth Scott, and told the story of that girl, her problems, but that wasn't this movie. That would make it phony, if you cast it with Marilyn Monroe, a type like that. I needed somebody real." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{completely}} reshaped one of {{the most}} famous characters in the history of American advertising. It was the Fisk Tire Company's bedtime boy, who shouldered an oversized tire while dangling a lighted candle. It came with the catchphrase [...] "Time To Re-tire" [...] (debuted 1910). This slogan had a simple double meaning. A facial alteration turned the yawning into a smiling boy in early 1929. Martin was then commissioned to come up with a slightly more aged, modern-day figure in late 1929. The objective was to update the heavily publicized trademark, while still maintaining its charm and familiarity. The young lad's one-piece sleeper became a two-piece pajama set, during the changeover process. The slippers were also added. His four-year-old nephew was used as the model (neck down only). Still, the pose and all-important props remained basically intact (though with the current tire design and a more fashionable—less tilted—candle holder). This new look was described by the publicity manager at Fisk, to a national magazine writer in early 1930. As follows: [...] "A happy, smiling, 100-percent American boy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> two-piece pajama, radiating good cheer, ruddy-cheeked and tousle-headed, snappy and wide awake, standing in the old-time pose." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E
