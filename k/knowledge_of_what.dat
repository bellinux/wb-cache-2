5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the end user needs from a weather forecast {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E

According to Kapila, [...] "The government has a close <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on - and can influence the Arab militia." [...] The UN has estimated that 300,000 civilians in the Darfur region were killed between 2003 and 2010.|$|R

5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{took control}} of the case {{on the grounds that the}} artwork could likely cross state lines. They have {{conducted}} hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard, Japanese and French authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers. The FBI believes the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including The Storm on the Sea of Galilee; however, their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited. The FBI stated it believed to know the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased. They have declined to identify the individuals.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} originally {{outlined by}} Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant {{to reconcile the}} differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{goes on in the}} other universes.|$|E

A scoring system can be used to try to determine the biting snake based on clinical features, but these scoring systems are extremely specific to particular geographical areas.|$|E
25|$|Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) {{consists}} of methods for distributing a secret amongst {{a group of}} participants, each of whom is allocated {{a share of the}} secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares, of possibly different types, are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own. A secret sharing scheme is perfect if every collection of participants that does not meet the criteria for obtaining the secret, has no additional <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the secret is than does an individual with no share.|$|E
25|$|After {{the poor}} {{response}} in Parma to Zaira, Bellini stayed with Ferdinando and Giuditta Turina's {{family for a}} short period in May/June and then returned to Milan by the end of June and discovered that his grandfather, then 85, had died in Catania. No contract for another opera in sight, except for the possibility of working with the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. As is revealed by Herbert Weinstock, there is limited <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened to Bellini between June 1833 and February 1834, since no letters to Florimo from that period have survived, and the only sources are those letters sent to others.|$|E

25|$|This game {{requires}} two players, {{a referee}} and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee {{can see them}} both and also has his own set. Players place stones on their boards, with no <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> other players are doing. A referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied or there is illegal ko capture). The player is allowed to make another move.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a {{sufficient}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{has been done by}} others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, {{since the advent of}} modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.|$|E

Police also searched his home in the northern Adelaide suburb of Paradise, and seized a bottle of Mandrax. Einem admitted that the drugs were his and said that he used them to help him sleep. He denied having any other drugs in his possession, but police also seized a bottle of Noctec, concealed on a ledge behind his wardrobe. Einem also allowed police to take hair and blood samples, as well as carpets and other materials for testing.|$|E

Astronaut Angela Perry must deal with the knowledge that her father is a corrupt U.S. Senator whose malfeasance destroyed her family in the original timeline. Commander Chuck Taggart must try to keep his family together. His son, Neil, a computer technician on the Odyssey, must adjust to being seventeen again, when he was a poor student who hadn't yet discovered his talents.

25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (<b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E

25|$|Ligand-based drug design (or {{indirect}} drug design) {{relies on}} knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules {{may be used}} to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> binds to it, and this model in turn {{may be used to}} design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.|$|E
25|$|Where Herncliffe Gardens and Eddington Gardens stood, {{there is}} now the 1959 sea wall, beach and undersea mud. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had existed there persisted mostly in the mythology of local children, until in the 1990s an {{information}} board featuring a picture of Reid was erected beside the Pier. A Council Oyster Bay Trail cycle route, planned in 2009, is named after the area's history. Today there is an established walking route along the 1959 coastal defence; {{it is part of}} the Saxon Shore Way. The committee for Herne Bay Festival 2008 agreed a cross-marketing strategy with Whitstable Oyster Festival, thus recognising the history of dredging off Herne Bay by the oyster fisheries working from Hampton-on-Sea in the 19th century. There is still a very small fleet of day fishing boats operating offshore of the Hampton area, and landing on the beach at Herne Bay.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Crichton {{published}} two novels. The first, Binary, {{relates the}} story of a villainous middle-class businessman, who attempts to assassinate the President of the United States by stealing an army shipment of the two precursor chemicals that form a deadly nerve agent. The second, The Terminal Man, is about a psychomotor epileptic sufferer, Harry Benson, who in regularly suffering seizures followed by blackouts, conducts himself inappropriately during seizures, waking up hours later with no <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he has done. Believed to be psychotic, he is investigated; electrodes are implanted in his brain, continuing the preoccupation in Crichton's novels with machine-human interaction and technology. The novel was adapted into a film directed by Mike Hodges and starring George Segal, Joan Hackett, Richard A. Dysart and Donald Moffat, released in June 1974. However, neither the novel nor the film was well received by critics.|$|E
