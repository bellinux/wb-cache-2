25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Wolffian ducts a second pair of ducts is developed; these are the Müllerian ducts. Each arises on the lateral aspect of the corresponding Wolffian duct as a tubular invagination of the cells lining the abdominal cavity. The orifice of the invagination remains open, and undergoes enlargement and modification to form the abdominal ostium of the fallopian tube. The ducts pass backward lateral to the Wolffian ducts, but toward the posterior end of the embryo they cross to the medial side of these ducts, and thus come to lie side by side between and behind the latter—the four ducts forming what is termed the common genital cord, to distinguish it from the genital cords of the <b>germinal</b> <b>epithelium</b> seen later in this article. The Müllerian ducts end in an epithelial elevation, the Müllerian eminence, on the ventral part of the cloaca between the orifices of the Wolffian ducts. At a later stage the eminence opens in the middle, connecting the Müllerian ducts with the cloaca.|$|E

Mesothelial tissue covered the outer surfaces of the “cortex”. Over limited sectors a gap in the integrity of the meso-glial barrier were associated with neuroglial ectopias. The following points are of neurobiologic importance: the formation of the “miniature cerebral cortex” occurred in the absence of any influence of afferent subcortical fibers. The radial alignment of glial fibers between the <b>germinal</b> pseudostratified <b>epithelium</b> and the outer surface occurred only in sectors of the neuro-ectodermal mass where a “neo-cortex” was present, and may therefore have been a critical determinant in the formation of the “cortical plate”.

Oligodendrocyte-type- 2 {{astrocyte}} (O- 2 A) glial progenitor cells {{undergo a}} limited number of mitotic divisions in response to PDGF before differentiating into oligodendroc 3,tes, the myelin-forming cell of the CNS. We examined the mechanism limiting O- 2 A proliferation, and demonstrate that these cells secrete an inhibitor of cell proliferation that can be neutralized with antibodies to TGF-B. O- 2 A cells also secrete an inhibitory activity that cannot be neutralized with TGFo/ 3 antibodies. O- 2 A progenitor cultures express TGF-/ 31 isoform and its transcript, while oligodendrocyte cultures express TGF-B 1,/ 3 - 2, and/ 3 - 3 isoforms. Both recombinant TGF- ~ and O- 2 A conditioned medium inhibit the proliferation of O- 2 A pro-genitor cells cultured in the presence of PDGF, and this inhibition can be partially neutralized with polyclonal TGF-/ 3 antibodies. Thus, TGF-/ 3 produced by O- 2 A cells may limit PDGF-driven mitosis and promote oligodendrocyte development. TGF-/ 3 is a less potent inhibitor of O- 2 A proliferation when these cells are cultured in the presence of bFGF, suggesting that bFGF interferes with TGF- ~ signaling. Thus, the production of TGF-/ 3 by cells in the O- 2 A lineage may account for the distinct effects of PDGF and bFGF on O- 2 A progenitor cell proliferation. Moreover, our results suggest that TGF-/ 3 may be an important mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation.

The site of tracer uptake varied with particle size, occurring superficially along lymphoepithelial folds for smaller particles but deeper within fissures for larger particles. Using computerized image analysis, a statistically significant increase in uptake was demonstrated between 5 and 15 minutes of tracer contact time and between 3 and 5 weeks of age;These studies document the similarity in structure and function between CALT and other mucosal lymphoid tissues.

40|$|Hyperresponsiveness and {{inflammation}} {{are major}} pathophysiological features of both allergic rhinitis and asthma. The mechanisms behind {{these are not}} fully understood. The aims of this thesis were to investigate if cytokines involved in the allergic response can induce airway hyperreactivity by affecting the airway smooth muscle directly and to identify novel mediators involved in allergic airway inflammation. The effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 4 on airway smooth muscle contractions was investigated in an organ culture model. Prolonged exposure to IL- 4 enhanced contractions induced by des-Arg 9 -bradykinin (dA-BK) and bradykinin (BK). This effect was mediated via an up-regulation of B 1 -receptors and through altered signaling along the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways. Thus, IL- 4, besides its previously known effects on the allergic phenotype, may also exhibit direct effects on airway smooth muscle cells, contributing {{to the development of}} airway hyperreactivity. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) was used in combination with mass spectrometry to identify protein patterns in nasal lavage fluid obtained from patients with allergic rhinitis and healthy controls. Six novel proteins, not previously described in the nose, were identified: S 100 calcium-binding protein A 7 (S 100 A 7), Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 2 B (WNT 2 B), galectin- 3, alpha enolase, intersectin- 2 and hypothetical protein MGC 33648. Of these, S 100 A 7 was down- and WNT 2 B up-regulated among patients. The previously known role of S 100 A 7 in various forms of skin inflammation, including atopic eczema, made it of special interest to investigate its role in allergic airway inflammation. Thus, further investigations were performed on material derived from the nose, the palatine tonsils and cultured epithelial cells. In the nose, immunohistochemical staining for S 100 A 7 was seen in the epithelium and in seromucous glands. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated increased levels of S 100 A 7 in nasal lavage fluid cells obtained from patients with allergic rhinitis, both during season and following nasal allergen provocation. These results were confirmed in nasal biopsies using real-time PCR. In analogy, cultured nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (Detroit 562) increased their S 100 A 7 mRNA expression after stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, an effect mediated via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) induced transcription. The difference seen between mRNA and protein levels in humans might be related to disease driven consumption or alternatively to an impaired translation of mRNA into protein. In palatine tonsils, S 100 A 7 protein was detected in the <b>epithelium,</b> <b>germinal</b> centers and T cell zones. S 100 A 7 mRNA expression levels among allergic individuals were generally lower than in healthy control subjects. A similar picture was seen in the nose when patients sampled outside pollen season were compared to healthy controls. In addition, tonsils with bacterial infections expressed reduced mRNA levels of S 100 A 7 compared to non-infected tonsils. The gene coding for S 100 A 7 was resequenced in a set of allergic individuals, resulting in the identification of 13 polymorphisms. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping in allergic and non-allergic individuals revealed an increased minor allele frequency (MAF) for a non-synonymous SNP (rs 3014837) in allergic individuals. It was also established that the major haplotype, containing the major allele at all sites, was more common in non-allergic individuals, while the haplotype containing the minor allele at rs 3014837 was equally more common among the allergic individuals. Additionally, heterozygotes at this site had significantly higher scores in skin prick tests for 9 out of 11 tested allergens, compared to homozygotes. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for four other mediator candidates identified through nasal lavage screening; Prolactin-inducible protein (PIP), WNT 2 B, Palate lung and nasal epithelial clone (PLUNC) and CLC (Charcot-Leyden crystal protein) were investigated for association with allergic rhinitis. All investigated SNPs in CLC were polymorphic and eight SNPs, located in the putative promoter region, yielded increased χ 2 -values with respect to genotype frequencies. It appeared that homozygotes for the minor alleles were more common in the allergic group, compatible with a recessive inheritance model. Furthermore, the minor alleles were all located on the same haplotype. None of the investigated SNPs in PIP, WNT 2 B and PLUNC were found {{to be associated with the}} disease. To summarize, results presented in this thesis demonstrate that prolonged exposure to cytokines, like IL- 4, have the ability to affect airway smooth muscle directly, causing hyperreactivity. Six proteins not previously demonstrated in the nose were identified. The expression of one of these, S 100 A 7, was found to be connected with changes caused by allergic airway inflammation. Further, genetic analysis revealed variations in the gene coding for S 100 A 7, which appear to be associated with the occurrence of allergic rhinitis. Genetic association with allergic rhinitis was found also for another recently identified nasal protein, CLC. This renders S 100 A 7 and CLC promising candidates for further investigations regarding their tentative role as diagnostic markers and targets for novel therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease resulting in progressive fibrosis {{of the oral}} tissues that can cause difficulty in chewing, swallowing, speaking, and mouth opening. Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} OSF is a precancerous condition and 2 - 8 % of the OSF patients develop squamous cell carcinoma. This disease affects 0. 5 % of the population in the Indian subcontinent and is now a growing public health issue {{in many parts of the}} world. Habit of chewing betel quid has been proposed as an important etiological factor in the development of this disease and is coline, a principle alkaloid of areca nut is considered as major causative factor for OSF development. But the exact molecular mechanism of OSF pathogenesis is not known. Therefore, we set the following objectives for this study: 1) Gene expression profiling of OSF using microarray. 2) Role of areca nut constituents in OSF pathogenesis. 3) Effect of areca nut on epithelial and fibroblast cells. In order to delineate the possible molecular mechanism of OSF pathogenesis, we took microarray approach and identified differentially regulated genes in ten OSF tissues against eight pooled normals using whole human genome oligonucleotide arrays. Microarray results revealed differential expression of 5288 genes (p≤ 0. 05 and Fold change≥ 1. 5), among them 2884 were up-regulated and 2404 were down-regulated. Validation employing quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed up-regulation of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), TGFBI, THBS 1, SPP 1, TIG 1 and down-regulation of bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP 7), C 4 orf 7 and ALOX 12 in OSF tissues. Furthermore, activation of TGF-β pathway was evident in OSF tissues as demonstrated by p-SMAD 2 strong immunoreactivity. Analysis of IHC data showed that in all the normal tissues and in 70 % of the OSF tissues the expression of TGF-β and BMP 7 are inversely correlated. In good correlation, treatment of keratinocytes (HaCaT) by TGF-βdown-regulated BMP 7, while BMP 7 expression could not be detected in fibroblast cells. Hence, the imbalance between TGF-βand BMP 7 signalling, which are positive and negative modulators of extracellular matrix production, respectively may trigger the manifestation of OSF. We also studied the regulation few genes (CTGF, TGM 2 and THBS 1) identified in OSF microarray in response to TGF-βand arecoline. TGF-βwas able to induce all the above genes in both HaCaT and hGF cells but arecoline could only induce TGM 2 in hGF and THBS 1 in HaCaT. Therefore TGF-βpathway came out to be the most important pathway in OSF microarray and subsequent validations. But areca nut constituents responsible for TGF-βpathway activation and the source (epithelial or fibroblast cells) through which it activates TGF-βare not known. In an attempt to understand the role of areca nut and its constituents in inducing TGF-βsignalling in epithelial cells, we performed microarray on epithelial cells (HaCaT) treated with areca nut water extract. Surprisingly, 64 % of the differentially regulated genes by areca nut water extract matched with TGF-βinduced gene expression profile. To find out areca nut induced genes through TGF-β, epithelial cells were treated with areca nut in presence of ALK 5 (TβRI) inhibitor. Out of 64 % differentially induced genes, 57 % genes induced by areca nut got compromised in presence of ALK 5 and 7 % were independently induced by areca nut, highlighting the effect of areca nut via TGF-β. Accordingly, areca nut treatment induced both p-SMAD 2 and TGF-βdownstream targets TGFBI, TGM 2, TMEPAI and THBS 1 in HaCaT cells. One possible mechanism of TGF-βsignalling induction by areca nut could be via induced ligand (TGF-β 2) and its activator (THBS 1). Induction of TGF-β 2 ligand by areca nut was shown at both RNA (Real Time) and protein (ELISA) levels. To find out areca nut components responsible for inducing TGF-β signalling, areca nut fractionation was performed which gave three fractions namely, Ethyl acetate (polyphenol), water supernatant (alkaloids) and Dichloromethane (impurity). Out of these; polyphenol and alkaloid fractions were found to be responsible for the induction of TGF-β signalling and its downstream targets. Upon treatment with purified components, catechin and tannin of polyphenol fraction and arecoline, arecaidine and guvacine of alkaloid fraction were found to be responsible for inducing TGF-β signalling, as seen by increased appearance of phopho-SMAD 2 in HaCaT cells. Areca nut treatment on human gingival fibroblast cells (hGF) did not induce TGF-β signalling, highlighting that the source of TGF-β induction by areca nut could possibly be the epithelium. Further treatment of areca nut along with TGF-β on hGF cells potentiated TGF-β effect both in terms of TGF-β downstream targets like TGFBI, TGM 2, TMEPAI, COL 1 A 1 etc and activation of fibroblast by inducing α-SMA. Increasing concentration of areca nut is cytotoxic on HaCaT cells and pro-proliferative on hGF cells. This could provide a possible explanation for epithelial atrophy and proliferating fibroblast cells in connective tissue of OSF patients. Further exploration on HaCaT cell cytotoxicity by areca nut suggests the involvement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as a key molecule induced by areca nut. Compromising ROS generation by NAC (N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine) led to reversal of Sub-G 1 peak induced by areca nut in HaCaT cells. This highlighted that cell death caused by areca nut could be ROS mediated. Areca nut treatment on hGF cells did not induce ROS generation, leading to no cytotoxicity on these cells. A possible explanation of this differential ROS generation can be due to dose dependent suppression of Catalase activity by areca nut in HaCaT cells but not in hGF cells. We also compared cytotoxicity of areca nut with all the alkaloids and found a good match with arecoline as both of them induce ROS, apoptotic ladder formation, annexin V positivity, suppression of Catalase activity and the cell death induced by them was compromised by NAC. The above results indicated that arecoline could be a mediator of areca nut water extract cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells. Betel nut chewer’s oral epithelium gets regularly exposed to areca nut and hence this exposure could be cytotoxic to oral epithelial cells too. We performed Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in normal and OSF tissues. Our data showed 62. 5 % of OSF patients having significant percentage of epithelial cells with TUNEL positivity (Labeling index = 2 - 60 %) compared to all normal tissues that were TUNEL negative. TUNEL positivity was predominantly seen in the upper keratin and supra basal layer of the epithelium. We also studied proliferation status of OSF epithelium and observed that 3 - 17 % (LI) of epithelial cells in all normal tissues showed Ki- 67 positivity in the <b>germinal</b> layer of <b>epithelium.</b> However, 65 % of the OSF patients showed staining for Ki- 67 (LI=. 2 - 58 %) in their epithelium. Also analysis of TUNEL positive and Ki- 67 positive sections indicated that OSF patients with high TUNEL positivity have high Ki- 67 labeling index, but stains in the supra basal or keratin layer (TUNEL) and basal layer (Ki- 67) of epithelium respectively. This induced proliferation of epithelial cells could be the result of heavy apoptosis in the outer epithelium. But as these patients are regularly exposed to areca nut, this increased proliferation may not be able to cope up with the heavy apoptosis induced by areca nut, leading to atrophied epithelium. To understand the germinal status of OSF atrophied epithelium we performed staining for OCT 4 in OSF tissues. To our surprise there were no OCT 4 positive nuclei in the epithelium of 53 % of OSF patients but a regular spread of OCT 4 positivity has been seen in the epithelium of normal subjects. In conclusion, this thesis highlights the involvement of TGF-β pathway in OSF patho-physiology. In addition, activation of TGF-β pathway by areca nut constituents has been demonstrated. Moreover, the atrophied epithelium of OSF appears to be a consequence of apoptosis and stem cell deprivation. Taken together, areca nut perhaps causes atrophy of the epithelium and activates TGF-β pathway that may lead to manifestation of OSF...|$|R

At a later stage the eminence opens in the middle, connecting the Müllerian ducts with the cloaca.|$|E
50|$|The major {{morphological}} {{difference among}} {{different species of}} Echinococcus is {{the length of the}} tapeworm. E. granulosus is approximately 2 to 7 mm while E. multilocuralis is often smaller and is 4 mm or less. On the other hand, E. vogeli is found to be up to 5.6 mm long and E. oligarthrus is found to be up to 2.9 mm long. In addition to the difference in length, there are also differences in the hydatid cysts of the different species. For instance, in E. multilocularis, the cysts have an ultra thin limiting membrane and the <b>germinal</b> <b>epithelium</b> may bud externally. Furthermore, E. granulosus cysts are unilocular and full of fluid while E. multilocularis cysts contain little fluid and are multilocular. For E. vogeli, its hydatid cysts are large and are actually polycystic since the germinal membrane of the hydatid cyst actually proliferates both inward, to create septa that divide the hydatid into sections, and outward, to create new cysts. Like E. granulosus cysts, E. vogeli cysts are filled with fluid.|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural {{distribution}} of alkaline phosphatase {{has been investigated}} in the testis of the domestic fowl. Enzyme activity was observed in the <b>germinal</b> <b>epithelium</b> and in the peritubular tissue. In both situations the activity was located in the plasma membranes. The activity in the <b>germinal</b> <b>epithelium</b> was marked basally in the germinal cells and in the Sertoli cells. There was a gradual reduction and an ultimate disappearance of enzyme activity towards the luminal region. The presence of enzyme in the <b>germinal</b> <b>epithelium</b> {{is in contrast to}} results of similar studies in some mammals. The peritubular localisation is comparable to that of mammals and confirms light microscope observations reported for the fowl testis...|$|E
