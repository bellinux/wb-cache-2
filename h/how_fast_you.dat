40|$|How {{long does}} it take you to go home? This depends on how far you are from home (displacement), <b>how</b> <b>fast</b> (velocity) <b>you</b> can travel, and how often you must start and stop (acceleration). This module treats kinematics, which is the part of physics {{concerned}} with the description of the motion of a body. The body may be an automobile, a baseball, a raindrop, a flower in the wind, or a running horse. The change in position of a body can be described in terms of the vector quantities: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Calculus can be used to define the relationships among these quantities. It is therefore essential to know some basic techniques of calculus to understand the content of this module. The applications in this module only consider motion in one dimension. A later module will treat the more general case of motion in two or three dimensions, but the fundamental concepts will be essentially the same...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt} Organizations {{are often}} {{challenged}} {{to identify and}} resolve workplace problems. The Critical Incident technique gives them a starting point and a process for advancing organizational development through learning experiences. It helps them study “what people do” in various situations. One might think there are no answers to the following questions: <b>How</b> <b>fast</b> can <b>you</b> think on your feet? How do you react {{in the face of}} the unexpected? How can you prepare if you cannot predict? And yet, there are. Evidently, some behaviors contribute to the successor failure of individuals—and organizations—in specific situations. And so, responses to the unforeseen lie in identifying before the fact events or circumstances, or series of them, that are outside the range of ordinary human experiences. The questions posed earlier are as old as mankind; but our ability to address them owes largely to the relatively recent work of John Flanagan. These days critical incidents can be harvested to provide a rich, personal perspective of life that facilitates understanding of the issues and obstacles people face every now and then and illuminates avenues for improvement (or replication if outcomes are effective) —avenues that may not be apparent through purely quantitative methods of data collection. This should matter to high-performance organizations...|$|R

40|$|Physics {{can explain}} {{many of the}} things that we {{commonly}} encounter. It can tell us why the night is dark, what causes the tides, and even how best to catch a baseball. With In Praise of Simple Physics, popular math and science writer Paul Nahin presents a plethora of situations that explore the science and math behind the wonders of everyday life. Roaming through a diverse range of puzzles, he illustrates how physics shows us ways to wring more energy from renewable sources, to measure the gravity in our car garages, to figure out which of three light switches in the basement controls the light bulb in the attic, and much, much more. <b>How</b> <b>fast</b> can <b>you</b> travel from London to Paris? How do scientists calculate the energy of an atomic bomb explosion? How do you kick a football so it stays in the air and goes a long way downfield? Nahin begins with simpler problems and progresses to more challenging questions, and his entertaining, accessible, and scientifically and mathematically informed explanations are all punctuated by his trademark humor. Readers are presumed to have some background in beginning differential and integral calculus. Whether you simply have a personal interest in physics' influence in the world or you're an engineering and science student who wants to gain more physics know-how, this book has an intriguing scenario for you...|$|R

If you're in a car driving down the road and you close your eyes, {{you have no idea what}} your speed is. It's the same thing if you're free falling from space. There are no signposts. You know you are going very <b>fast,</b> but <b>you</b> don't feel it. You don't have a 614-mph wind blowing on you. I could only hear myself breathing in the helmet."Kittinger set historical numbers for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest duration drogue-fall (four minutes), and fastest speed by a human being through the atmosphere. These were the USAF records, but were not submitted for aerospace world records to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). [...] Kittinger's record for the highest ascent was broken in 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather. His records for highest parachute jump and fastest velocity stood for 52 years, until they were broken in 2012 by Felix Baumgartner.For this series of jumps, Kittinger was profiled in both Life Magazine and the National Geographic Magazine, decorated with a second Distinguished Flying Cross, and awarded the Harmon Trophy by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|R
