[...] In earlier days, GM ran Super Bowl commercials produced by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for the EV1. In later days it ran [...] "award winning" [...] doomsday-style advertising featuring the EV1 and ran customer surveys which emphasized drawbacks to <b>electronic</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology which were not actually present in the EV1. [...] (As a side note, CARB officials were quoted claiming that they removed their zero emission vehicle quotas in part because they gave weight to such surveys purportedly showing no demand existing for the EV1s.) Other charges raised on GM included sabotaging their own product program, failing to produce cars to meet existing demand, and refusing to sell cars directly (it only leased them).|$|E

30|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} requirement for portable electronics, hybrid <b>electronic</b> <b>vehicles</b> and other micro- and nanodevices, {{numerous studies have}} been carried out to develop many kinds of energy storage systems. As an important energy storage device, the widely studied supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, have been believed as a promising candidate due to their high specific power, long cycling life, fast charge and discharge rates, and reliable safety [1 – 9]. Though these supercapacitors demonstrated these distinctive advantages, as compared with the batteries and fuel cells, the relatively lower energy densities seriously block their large-scale practical application [4, 10]. So far, various electrode materials which include carbon materials [11, 12], transition metal oxides [2, 13 – 15], and conducting polymers [16, 17] have been designed and synthesized to enhance the electrochemical properties for the practical applications in the supercapacitors.|$|R
