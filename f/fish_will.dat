5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish.

Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not eat {{as much as the}} dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the increased danger they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller.

For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted.

From this point, the caudal peduncle patch and dorsal fin patch will begin to appear, but the body will also be seen to be covered in fine black 'pepper dots' between these black patches.

25|$|The {{practice}} of catch and release is criticised by some who consider it unethical to inflict pain upon a fish {{for purposes of}} sport. Some of those who object to releasing fish do not object to killing fish for food. Adherents of catch and release dispute this charge, pointing out that fish commonly feed on hard and spiky prey items, and as such {{can be expected to}} have tough mouths, and also that some <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> re-take a lure they have just been hooked on, a behaviour that is unlikely if hooking were painful. Opponents of catch and release fishing would find it preferable to ban or to severely restrict angling. On the other hand, proponents state that catch-and-release is necessary for many fisheries to remain sustainable, is a practice that generally has high survival rates, and consider the banning of angling as not reasonable or necessary.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around the cages to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay {{in a short time}} period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments is that all the <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> be treated equally, in contrast to in-feed treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{false scad}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} during {{its second year}} of life at a length of around 20cm in both sexes. The timing of spawning appears to vary slightly between locations, with {{a study in the}} Mediterranean indicating a period from June to August, while a study off Senegal found the period to be more protracted, occurring from April to November. Spawning occurs in shallow inshore waters, with the event occurring at an optimum water temperatures of 18.7 degrees Celsius. Studies on females between 29 and 35cm in length found each fish releases between 480,000 and 990,000 eggs, with the species a partial spawner, in which a proportion of the mature oocytes are not released from the ovary and are instead reabsorbed by the female. Larvae and juveniles remain in the shallow water environment, with growth quite rapid in the species. The newly hatched <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> reach a length of 12.2cm at age one year, 17.9cm at two, 22.3cm at three, and 29.7 at the age of five years.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one <b>fish</b> <b>will</b> take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} global climate were {{projected}} on the distribution and growth potential of common freshwater fishes in 5 streams and 27 classes of lakes in Minnesota. The method developed for, this analysis uses laboratory growth and mortality data, and a stream temperature-fish distribution database, to define temperature responses for 32 fish species. Sensitivity to depressed dissolved oxygen concentrations was derived from information presented in the U. S. EPA ambient water quality criteria document on oxygen. Stream and lake water temperatures and lake dissolved oxygen concentrations are simulated by one-dimensional, unsteady heat and oxygen transport models operating on a timestep of one day. Simulations are made for a 25 -year historical period (1955. - 80) and projected steady-state future climate simulated by general circulation models assuming a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 • Water temperature and dissolved oxygen (D. O.) concentrations simulated for streams and lakes are then compared to "critical" values for presence (survival) or "good" growth (time of exposure to temperatures permitting rapid growth) of a fish species or guild. The results project expected impacts on representative Minnesota streams, while the lake results represent a regional analysis for {{the state as a}} whole. The following conclusions stand out among the many study results. In wide, essentially unshaded streams, global warming is expected to contribute to elimination of coldwater fishes and some coolwater fishes in many habitats where they were formerly present. Warmwater <b>fishes</b> <b>will</b> gain substantially more potential for good growth than existed previously. Coldwater <b>fishes</b> <b>will</b> have a chance for continued existence only in those streams with adequate shading by riparian trees. Coldwater <b>fishes</b> <b>will</b> have the best chance to survive in deep lakes located in the northern half of the state, but there will be a loss in habitat for good growth. Warmwater <b>fishes</b> <b>will</b> gain habitat for good growth in virtually all types of lakes. Coolwater <b>fishes</b> <b>will</b> gain habitat enabling good growth in most types of lakes. Losses or gains in good growth potential due to global warming are projected to be larger in deep lakes than in shallow ones. The trophic state of the water body will also have an influence on the response of indigenous fishes to climate change. In shallow lakes, trophic state is projected to have little effect on the influence of global warming on habitat suitability for fishes. In deeper, seasonally stratified eutrophic lakes losses or gains of habitat for good growth are projected to be smaller than in oligotrophic lakes of the same size and depth. Lake size and depth are of importance as they affect seasonal stratification of water temperature and dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen limitations are more serious in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes. They are also more apparent in deep lakes than in shallow ones. Climate change is projected to worsen availability of habitats for good growth due to oxygen limitations. For the state as a whole, the potentital for good growth of lake dwelling, coolwater fishes is projected to increase by 20 percent and for warmwater fishes by 53 percent. Coldwater species will lose 40 percent of their habitat suitable for good growth. The total habitat for good growth of Minnesota lake fishes, regardless of guild designation, is projected to increase by 6 percent.
