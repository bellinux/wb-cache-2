5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E
5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch Harbour Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to English oak and silver birch amongst many other trees, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> interest, {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance Survey map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E

5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased {{activity of the}} 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted fishery <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E
5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E

The subspecies is ecologically unique, having unique and irregular skin patterns on its back, a unique moisture tolerance, {{and it is also}} an endemic that is geographically isolated {{from the rest of the}} species range. Other subspecies include A. m. columbianum, A. m. krausei, A. m. macrodactylum and A. m. sigillatum.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

5|$|The most {{abundant}} iron isotope 56Fe <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> interest to nuclear scientists because {{it represents the}} most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires {{a great deal more}} energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the {{most abundant}} element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight. Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.|$|E
