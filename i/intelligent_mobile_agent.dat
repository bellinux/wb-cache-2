40|$|One of {{the grand}} {{challenges}} to achieving wide spread use and rapid development of multi-agent systems is to adapt principles of software engineering. Agent-oriented software provides a new software engineering paradigm and the opportunities for development of new domain-specific software models. With the continuing improvement of agent technology, and {{the rapid growth of}} software system complexity, especially for Internet applications, there is a pressing need for general models of mobile agents – models that explicitly support the features of mobility, cooperative behavior, and intelligence. We present a design model for <b>intelligent</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> software by introducing mobility into a framework for agent-oriented software. The model facilitates design reuse by providing an inheritance mechanism and explicitly supports asynchronous message passing.

The main objective of Internet users is to find the required information with high efficiency and effectiveness.

In the search phase, the <b>intelligent</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> receives the image of object as a query and searches the set of web pages that contain information about the object. This is done by matching the query to images on web pages faster than the work presented in [25]. Furthermore, by applying cross correlation, object detection becomes position independent.
