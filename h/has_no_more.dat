5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> lines than any of these and disappears after {{the first page of}} the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.|$|E
5|$|Language endangerment {{occurs when}} a {{language}} is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E
5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> incentive to discuss its operations today than it had in the 1960s or 1970s. Although the U.S. has been more open about its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E

25|$|Otherwise, draw {{a square}} box around the Schwartz set, {{in the upper}} left corner. You can {{describe}} it as the minimal 'winner's circle' of candidates who do not lose to anyone outside the circle. Note that {{to the right of}} the box there is no red, which means it's a winner's circle, and note that within the box there is no reordering possible that will produce a smaller winner's circle (if the Schwartz set <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than three candidates, this not hard).|$|E
25|$|City councilors can run {{as either}} a {{representative}} of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives {{the greatest number of}} votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if {{they do not want to}} be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.|$|E
25|$|Flag {{officers}} typically retire well {{in advance}} of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the upward career mobility of their juniors. Since there is a finite number of three-star slots available to each service, typically one officer must leave office before another can be promoted. Maintaining a three-star rank is a game of musical chairs; once an officer vacates a position bearing that rank, he or she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 60 days to be appointed or reappointed to a job of equal or higher importance before he or she must involuntarily retire. Historically, officers leaving three-star positions were allowed to revert to their permanent two-star ranks to mark time in lesser jobs until statutory retirement, but now such officers are expected to retire immediately to avoid obstructing the promotion flow.|$|E

25|$|Tomić was {{the editor}} of Srpsko kolo and Zastava {{magazines}} {{and founder of the}} People's Freethinker Party (Narodna slobodoumna stranka), which in 1891 became the Radical Party (Radikalna stranka). In 1889, following a drawn-out series of provocations regarding the honour of his wife, Tomić stabbed to death a liberal political rival, Miša Dimitrijević, {{the editor of}} Branik magazine, in Novi Sad. He served seven years in prison for murder, emerging in 1896 with no loss of political zeal. Not only political but economic issues had far reaching importance to him. Tomić, then the most vociferous opponent of the hierarchy, the leader of the Serbian radical party and son-in-law of Svetozar Miletić, blamed the clergy for driving people away from churches because of its insistence on controlling church and autonomous finances: Whoever has to worry about how to spend so much money <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> time to care for the church and people.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, they {{resemble}} the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as hedgehogs and porcupines. They are usually black or brown in colour. There {{have been several}} reports of albino echidnas, their eyes pink and their spines white. They have elongated and slender snouts that function as both mouth and nose. Like the platypus, they are equipped with electrosensors, but while the platypus has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000 electroreceptors, and the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 400 located {{at the tip of}} its snout. They have very short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws. The echidna feeds by tearing open soft logs, anthills and the like, and using its long, sticky tongue, which protrudes from its snout, to collect prey. The echidnas' ears are slits on the sides of their heads that are usually unseen {{due to the fact that}} they are blanketed by their spines. The external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle.|$|E

500|$|The holotype of {{the species}} Oryzomys fulgens, which Thomas had {{described}} in 1893, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> precise locality than [...] "Mexico", but the Valley of Mexico has been suggested as its origin. It is a large, coarse-furred, bright reddish, long-tailed species with a broad skull with widely spreading zygomatic arches. Goldman wrote that it was similar to crinitus, but more intensely colored, and differed {{in the form of}} the interorbital region; he retained it as a separate species pending further investigations. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales noted that archival research may yet uncover the precise origin of O.fulgens, which could establish it as an older name for one of the other central Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
500|$|A pseudoforest is an {{undirected graph}} {{in which each}} {{connected}} component contains at most one cycle. [...] Equivalently, it is an undirected graph in which each connected component <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> edges than vertices. [...] The components that have no cycles are just trees, while the components that have a single cycle within them are called 1-trees or unicyclic graphs. [...] That is, a 1-tree is a connected graph containing exactly one cycle. [...] A pseudoforest with a single connected component (usually called a pseudotree, although some authors define a pseudotree to be a 1-tree) is either a tree or a 1-tree; in general a pseudoforest may have multiple connected components as long as {{all of them are}} trees or 1-trees.|$|E

500|$|The BSA's {{stated purpose}} at its {{incorporation}} in 1910 was [...] "to teach [...] patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values." [...] Later, in 1937, Deputy Chief Scout Executive George J. Fisher expressed the BSA's mission: [...] "Each generation {{as it comes}} to maturity <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows." [...] The current mission statement of the BSA is [...] "to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them {{the values of the}} Scout Oath and Law."

500|$|For this {{operation}} Model had {{at his disposal}} Sixth SS Panzer Army, Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army. These armies, with over 2,000 panzers and 2,000 airplanes [...] represented the last strategic reserve of the crumbling Third Reich. Despite his misgivings, Model threw himself into the task with his usual energy, cracking down on any defeatism he might find. When a staff officer complained about shortages, Model snapped: [...] "If you need anything, take it from the Americans". When Ludwig Heilmann warned Model that his command 5th Parachute Division was only a Class IV outfit, Model, who by now must have been surfeited with complaints on lack of equipment and insufficient training, merely replied that success would be won by the paratroopers' [...] "usual audacity." [...] He remained acutely aware of both the operation's significance, and its most likely outcome. When Colonel Friedrich August von der Heydte, ordered to lead a parachute drop {{as part of the}} operation, said that the jump had no more than a 10 percent chance of success, he replied: [...] "Well, then it is necessary to make the attempt, since the entire offensive <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a 10 percent chance of success. It must be done, since this offensive is the last remaining chance to conclude the war favourably." ...|$|E

He enlists the help of the Master Chief, whom he calls a [...] "Reclaimer," [...] to activate Halo's defenses, neglecting to tell the Master Chief that Halo's [...] "defenses" [...] would cause the destruction of all sentient life in the galaxy. He attempts to stop the Master Chief and Cortana from destroying the Pillar of Autumn, and thereby destroying Halo, but is ultimately thwarted when the ship explodes and destabilizes his ring, causing it to break up. Discovered in the system by the Covenant, Spark, known as an [...] "Oracle" [...] to the Prophets, eventually informs the Covenant Hierarchs of how to activate Installation 05 in Halo 2. In Halo 3, Spark allies with the humans and Elites; since his installation has been destroyed and he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> orders, Spark decides to help the Master Chief. Leading the Chief across the Ark, Guilty Spark discovers a new, uncompleted Halo, which is being built to replace Installation 04. Guilty Spark is ecstatic, but when Sergeant Johnson prepares to fire the new Halo to stop the Flood—a process that would destroy the incomplete ring and damage the Ark—Spark goes berserk, refusing to let the Reclaimers destroy [...] "his" [...] ring. He is subsequently destroyed by the Master Chief with a Spartan Laser, but Sergeant Johnson is fatally wounded in the fight.|$|E
