As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases. Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.|$|E

This paper focuses on applying an artificial neural network (ANN) approach with a feed-forward back-propagation non-linear autoregressive neural network to predict the <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> quality of Sanandaj WTP. <b>Influent</b> <b>water</b> quality data gathered over a 2 -year period were used to building the prediction model. The study signifies that the ANN can predict the <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> quality parameters with a correlation coefficient (R) between the observed and predicted output variables reaching up to 0. 93. The prediction models developed in this work for Alkalinity, pH, calcium, carbon dioxide, temperature, total hardness, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and electrical conductivity have an acceptable generalization capability and accuracy with coefficient of determination (R 2) ranging from 0. 86 for alkalinity to 0. 54 for electrical conductivity. The predicting ANN model provides an effective analyzing and diagnosing tool to understand and simulate the non-linear behavior of the <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> characteristics.

Water sample {{were collected from}} the four <b>influent</b> <b>waters</b> (Adam's Valley Creek, Burn's Creek, Dutch Creek, and the La Crosse River), the marsh upstream from the lake, four sites within the lake, and one site downstream from the dam. Two deep water sites in the lake were sampled at the surface, middle, and near-bottom of the water column. Samples were collected from all sites from February through September, 1985, at which time the lake was drained for dam repairs. Influent samples were collected through December, 1985. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and Secchi disk transparency were recorded in the field. Non-filterable residues, specific conductance, pH, total alkalinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosporus, and total phosporus were analyzed in the laboratory. Total alkalinity, pH, and conductivity were typical of a well-buffered lake. Dissolved oxygen in the lake fluctuated {{from top to bottom}} on a biweekly basis during the summer. Of the <b>influent</b> <b>waters,</b> Adam's Valley Creek consistently had the highest concentrations of nutrients. Within the lake, nitrate and ortho-phosphorus concentrations decreased 35 % from the inflow sites to the outflow site. This was likely due to assimilation by phtyoplankton, which may have increased the biological oxygen demand and decreased the dissolved oxygen in the deeper waters (3 m) of the lake. The La Crosse River supplies a majority of the water entering Lake Neshonoc, which explains the similarity between the lake and river water chemistry. The lake has lost 73 ha in the past 29 years. 23 % of its original surface area. Most of the loss occurred with the encroachment of the marsh.

40|$|Abstract In {{wastewater}} treatment plants, predicting <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> quality {{is important for}} energy management. The <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> quality is measured by metrics such as carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), potential of hydrogen, and total suspended solid. In this paper, a data-driven approach for timeahead prediction of CBOD is presented. Due to limitations in the industrial data acquisition system, CBOD is not recorded at regular time intervals, which causes gaps in the timeâ€“series data. Numerous experiments have been performed to approximate the functional relationship between the input and output parameters and thereby fill in the missing CBOD data.

The target compounds were one psychoactive stimulant, one antiepileptic, four analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, one lipid regula-tors, two anti-ulcer agents, nine antibiotics (sulfonamides andmacrolides), two beta-blockers, twometabolites, and 11 hormones (free and conjugates). The determination was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry after enrichment by solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB sorbent. Most of the pharmaceuticals were found in both influent and effluent samples from the two STPs. The most frequently detected were caffeine, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, sul-fapyridine, sulfathiazole, ranitidine, omeprazole, estrone 3 -sulfate, and estradiol 17 -glucuronide.

Clones related to methanogens including the methylotrophic Methanomethylovorans thermophila and hydrogen- and the formate-utilizing Methanolinea tarda were in abundance in both samples, but greater numbers of M. tarda-like clones were detected in the biofilm library. Both DGGE and cloning analysis results indicated that the archaea in the biofilm were derived from the <b>influent</b> produced <b>water.</b> Bacterial communities in the influent and biofilm samples were significantly different. Epsilonproteobacteria was the dominant bacterial group in the influent while Nitrospira and Deltaproteobacteria were the predominant groups in the biofilm. Many clones related to syntrophic bacteria were found among the Deltaproteobacteria. One Deltaproteobacteria clone was related to Syntrophus, which is commonly found in methanogenic hydrocarbon-degrading consortia. A number of Deltaproteobacteria clones were assigned to the clone cluster group TA, members of which predominate in various methanogenic consortia that degrade aromatic compounds. These results suggest that a microbial community associated with methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation may have been established in the biofilm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The diversity of the microbial community of rhizosphere soil was found to be significantly greater than that of the wetland <b>influent</b> <b>water.</b> This enhancement is likely due to the availability of diverse habitats and nutrients provided by the wetland plants. From function annotation of metagenomic data, a number of biodegradation pathways associated with 14 xenobiotic compounds were identified in soil.

40|$|A voltammetric {{procedure}} for {{the determination of}} dissolved and colloidal iron in mine-waters has been developed. Whilst mine-waters are of course enriched in iron. we are remarkably ignorant of the physical state and chemical speciation of the iron. This is a problem since the physical and chemical state of iron is central to understanding a range of processes relevant to mine-water geochemistry and remediation. Examples include hydrolysis of dissolved Fe (III) to release protons. the adsorption of trace metals onto iron colloids and the bioavailability of iron within wetlands designed to remediate acidic waters. In this work, we have developed differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) as a rapid and robust method of determining the concentration of truly dissolved and colloidal iron in 0. 45 J. lm filtered waters {{from a series of}} mine-water discharges and remediation sites in NE, England. Mine-water samples were collected from CoSTaR sites: these are abandoned mine sites in the UK, designated by the UK Coal Authority for remediation research and routine monitoring of water quality. The sites comprise of six full-scale bioreactors receiving a wide range of mine-waters with pH ranging from 3 to 5 and concentrations of 0. 45 Jlm) and/or colloidal Â« 0. 45 Jlm) iron can then be estimated as the difference between the voltammetric responses of natural samples and samples in which the solid phase iron has been dissolved by the addition of He!. v The percentage dissolved iron ranged from 60 - 90 % (in most cases) in unfiltered samples, while the percentage of colloidal iron varied widely across the sites; from 25 - 45 % in unfiltered samples and 50 - 75 % and 38 - 85 % for dissolved and colloidal iron in the 0. 45 Jim filtered samples. The ratio of Fe (II) to Fe (III) in the dissolved fraction was detennined usmg ultramicroelectrodes (UME) method. Iron ratio varied widely for the three sites studied. However, in general, the ratio is 1 : 1 for the surface <b>influent</b> <b>waters.</b> 1 : 3 for the sub-surface waters (underground water-Shilbottle site) and 3 : 1 for most of the effluent samples. Results suggest that in general, the <b>influent</b> <b>waters</b> are more oxidised and the effluent more reduced. Finally, characterisation of solid phase iron was done usmg a wide range of spectroscopic techniques. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) shows that iron colloids range from nm to Jim for lower pH mine waters; at higher pH, particles mainly aggregates on the Jim to mm scale.

X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer methods have revealed the presence of goethite {{in some of the}} concretions. Chemical analyses of the acid soluble portions of 72 samples gave an average composition of 43. 1 % Fe and 5. 65 % Mn with a low content of trace elements. The Shebandowan concretions are among the richest in iron of lake concretions reported, possibly because only the acid soluble portion was analysed. Their low content of trace elements suggests rapid growth rates and a relatively young age. A positive correlation was found between Mn and K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Ni, and Co and the relationship between the last three and Mn was deemed significant. Zn was independent of association with either Mn and Fe, probably due to the presence locally of zinc sulphide deposits. Analyses of lake bottom and <b>influent</b> <b>waters</b> suggested that frequent resampling of the sites would be required throughout the year to permit meaningful interpretation of the effect of water composition of concretions. Analyses of sediment cores from 20 concretion sites indicated an upward increase in Fe and Mn and in the Mn/Fe ratio, consistent with the model of upward migration of the elements, where Mn is more mobile than Fe.

For many remote, under-privileged and poor communities, {{this is the only}} pre-treatment of drinking water prior to boiling. With the emergence of arsenic contaminations in many groundwater aquifers, the filtration became imperative for many communities around the world. However, after repetitive/continuous uses, clogging of the filter media is obvious, which eventually causes poor performance of the filtration process. Backwashing is a common technique being used for the recovery of the filtration capacity of clogged filter media. This study presents development of a simple clogging and backwashing efficiency model for a special filter media.

40|$|Improving {{effluent}} water quality to receiving waters using stormwater ponds and storage tanks is acknowledged {{to be an}} effective method. The performance of the method depends however on flow conditions such as velocity distribution, short-circuiting currents and the volume through which the <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> flows, the so called effective volume. Enhancing performance, e. g. increasing the settling of suspended solids in stormwater ponds, demands better design and a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics. The overall objectives of the work reported in this thesis are to study the possibilities of using a generic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software and three-dimensional flow simulations as a design-engineering tool and to enhance knowledge of fluid dynamics in stormwater ponds and detention tanks. To be able to use three-dimensional simulations as a design tool, {{it is important that the}} simulations can predict the important flow features of ponds and tanks. Comparative studies were made using numerical and physical modelling in a large-scale model of a detention tank and a small-scale model of a storage tank. The flow pattern and residence time were analysed in the physical model of the detention tank using drogue tracking and impulse tracer tests. Sedimentation efficiency and distribution of sediment on the tank bottom were studied in the storage tank. Good agreement is found between measured and simulated flow patterns, residence time and particle removal for high inflow velocities. For low flow rates, difficulties were encountered in both the measurements and the simulations. Simulations show that an island placed in front of the inlet, so that the <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> hits the island perpendicularly, is most efficient for avoiding short-circuiting currents and extending the residence time in a rectangularly shaped pond. A subsurface berm placed in front of the inlet does not have the same impacts on short-circuiting. Moving the inlet so that only one circulation is created in the tank, extends the time needed for the initial tracer to reach the outlet, but the effective volume decreases. Denser <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> may change the flow pattern and decrease the effective volume.

While empirically derived guidelines (with area-adjusted contaminant removal rates typically quoted at 10 g Fe m 2 /day for <b>influent</b> <b>waters</b> pH &# 62; 5. 5; and 3. 5 - 7 g acidity/m 2 /day for pH &# 62; 4 to &# 60; 5. 5) for informing sizing of mine drainage treatment wetlands have generally been proved robust (probably due to conservatism), such data exhibit large variability within and between sites. Key areas highlighted for future research efforts include: (1) wider collation of mine drainage wetland performance data in regionalised datasets to improve empirically-derived design guidelines and (2) obtaining an improved understanding of nature of the extremophile microbial communities, microbially-mediated pollutant attenuation and rhizospheral processes in wetlands at extremes of pH. An enhanced knowledge of these (through multi-scale laboratory and field studies), will inform engineering design of treatment wetlands and assist in the move from the empirically-derived conservative sizing estimates that currently prevail to process-based optimal design guidance that could reduce costs and enhance the performance and longevity of wetlands for treating acidic and highly alkaline drainage waters...|$|R
40|$|The Bowden Close {{passive mine}} water {{treatment}} system (PTS), {{in the north}} east of England, was commissioned in 2003 to treat net-acidic coal mine drainage. The monitoring data for iron, aluminium and acidity in its influents and effluent {{for the first four}} years of the treatment are presented here. The PTS consists of two Reducing and Alkalinity Producing Systems (RAPS) operating in parallel, followed by a single polishing aerobic wetland. The main purpose of the treatment system is to raise pH and alkalinity of the mine water and to lower iron and aluminium concentrations. The two <b>influent</b> <b>waters</b> derive from an abandoned underground coal mine (influent 1, discharged into RAPS 1) and from a waste rock pile located on the former colliery site (influent 2, discharged into RAPS 2). The influents are moderate to strongly acidic, and iron- and aluminium-rich (pHmean = 4. 9 - 5. 6, alkalinitymean = 10 - 24 mg L- 1 CaCO 3 eq, acidity = 12 - 863 mg L- 1 CaCO 3 eq, Femean = 16 - 68 mg L- 1, and Almean = 5 - 32 mg L- 1. Average flow rates are 36 L min- 1 (influent 1) and 99 L min- 1 (influent 2). The pH of the final effluent is raised to 7. 0 (median) and always exceeds 5. 7. With few exceptions, the effluent is net alkaline (i. e. alkalinity>acidity) and iron and aluminium concentrations are lowered to 3. 4 mg L- 1 and 1. 5 mg L- 1 (median), respectively. The treatment system appears to be load limited and has a mean area-adjusted acidity removal rate of 9. 4 g d- 1 m- 2 (range: 2. 3 - 96 g d- 1 m- 2, as CaCO 3 eq). The monitoring data collected indicate the system serves the operational purpose for which it was designed. However, further work i...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the occurrence and the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals at a sewage treatment plant in UmeÃ¥. Levels of pharmaceuticals were measured on three consecutive days in <b>influent</b> <b>water,</b> after presedimentation and in effluent water using Online Solid Phase Extraction Liquid Chromatography â€“ tandem mass spectrometry (SPE LC-HESI-MS/MS). The selection of the 95 pharmaceuticals included in the study was primarily based on ecotoxological data, of which 31 were detected in 24 of 27 samples in levels between low ng/l to low Âµg/l. Â Paracetamol was detected in highest concentrations, up to 106 Âµg/l in <b>influent</b> <b>water,</b> but also showed the highest removal efficiency at 99. 8 %. Several pharmaceuticals showed negative removal rates, indicating an increase in concentration. None of the analyzed pharmaceuticals were detected in levels exceeding the calculated critical environmental concentration in the recipient Ume River and therefore no pharmacological effects are expected to occur in exposed fish. The sewage treatment plant at Ã–n has no emission limits for pharmaceuticals in its environmental permit, but the active upstream work carried out at the treatment plant aims to reduce the occurrence of drug residues in sewage. Today, there are no specific limits for pharmaceuticals released from Swedish sewage treatment plants and EU recently decided not to include pharmaceuticals on the list of priority substances in the Water Framework Directive, which probably would have led to more restrictions regarding drug residues in sewage effluent. ...|$|E
40|$|Novel osmotic {{membrane}} bioreactors (OMBRs) {{have been}} recently {{reported in the}} literature. An OMBR uses a dense salt-rejecting forward osmosis (FO) membrane, which exhibits high retention of organic matter and various other contaminants. Meanwhile, the high rejection nature also leads to the accumulation of salts in the bioreactor, which can adversely affect the biological activities {{as well as the}} FO water flux. A salt accumulation model is developed in the current study. Our model suggests that both the bioreactor salt concentration and the FO water flux are controlled by membrane properties (water permeability A, salt permeability B, mass transfer coefficient K m, and membrane orientation relative to the draw solution) and the OMBR operational conditions (salt concentration of the influent wastewater, draw solution concentration, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and sludge retention time (SRT)). The salt accumulation is contributed by both the influent wastewater and the reverse diffusion of solutes from the draw solution, and is directly proportional to the volumetric concentration factor (i. e., the SRT/HRT ratio). The relative importance of reverse diffusion over contribution from influent solutes is governed by the membrane selectivity. For a relatively selective membrane (B/A ll;the osmotic pressure of the <b>influent</b> <b>water),</b> solute reverse diffusion has negligible effect on OMBR performance. In contrast, the salt accumulation and FO water flux reduction are governed by reverse diffusion for B/A greater than the osmotic pressure of the <b>influent</b> <b>water.</b> The current study reveals the critical importance of the B/A ratio and HRT/SRT ratio for optimized OMBR operation.

The water was pumped through the columns in a saturated up-flow mode at a constant flow rate of ca. 0.2 Â mL/min. This flow rate was selected to facilitate an approximately 12 -h residence time for <b>influent</b> <b>water</b> within laboratory columns. <b>Influent</b> <b>water</b> and effluents from experimental columns were analyzed for pH, alkalinity, DOC, HCO 3 âˆ’, NOx-N, NH 3 -N, TN, soluble reactive P (SRP or PO 4 -P), TP, Al, Ca, Clâˆ’, Fe, Mg, Mn, K, Si, Na, and SO 4 2 âˆ’. The columns were operated to hydraulic failure, or until nutrient and DOC sorption capacities could be determined. Both CaO and CaCO 3 -based WTRs effectively attenuated inorganic N species, but exhibited little capacity for organic N removal. The CaO-based WTR demonstrated effective removal of DOC and P in column trials, and a high capacity for P sorption in batch experiments. Granular activated carbon proved effective for DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) removal in column trials, but was ineffective for P diminution. Only CFA demonstrated effective removal of a broad suite of inorganic and organic nutrients. Water treated by filtering through the CaO-based WTR exhibited nutrient ratios characteristic of potential P-limitation with no potential N- or Si-limitation with respect to growth of aquatic biota, indicating that treatment of nutrient-rich water using the CaO-based WTR may result in conditions less favorable for cyanobacterial growth and more favorable for growth of diatoms.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{constituents}} {{at the low}} to sub-microgram {{per liter}} level derived from wastewater effluents represent precursors to previously undetected disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water utilities. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is an emerging DBP of particular concern due to its suspected genotoxicity and carcinogenicity {{an order of magnitude}} greater than currently regulated DBPs. Granular activated carbon (GAC) {{has been shown to be}} a potential control technology for removing NDMA precursors from wastewater effluent, but adsorption behavior of specific precursor material is still poorly understood. The goal of this research is to expand knowledge of the GAC adsorption behavior of NDMA and other DBP precursors in wastewater effluent, including understanding the effect of different activated carbon types, the effect of varying GAC column Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), the effect of source water blending on NDMA precursor sorption, and the breakthrough of NDMA precursors relative to trihalomethane, haloacetic acid, and haloacetonitrile precursors. Lignite-based and wood-based activated carbon were found to remove NDMA precursors better than coconut-shell and bituminous carbons, presumably due to larger mesopore volumes. NDMA precursors are thought to be larger molecular weight compounds or behave in water such that adsorption occurs in the mesopore region. A distinct non-adsorbable fraction in powdered activated carbon batch tests suggests a range of different precursor compounds. In Rapid Small-Scale Column Tests (RSSCTs), a simulated 20 -minute bench-scale EBCT performed better than a 10 -minute column, thus longer EBCTs are suggested when optimizing GAC control for NDMA precursors in wastewater. NDMA precursors were also found to adsorb independently of bulk organic matter and other DBP precursors, suggesting its precursors are distinct from currently regulated and other nitrogenous DBPs. As a result, Overall Fluorescence Intensity was proposed as a possible surrogate for NDMA precursors due to its similar adsorption behavior in RSSCTs using blended <b>influent</b> <b>waters.</b> Evidence is also presented for considering NDMA precursors as similar to micropollutants due to rapid sorption in batch testing distinct from DOM, and diminished impacts of influent concentrations on fractional RSSCT breakthrough...|$|R
