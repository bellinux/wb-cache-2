5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a narrow line.|$|E

25|$|Star Fleet Battles is a ship-to-ship warfare {{simulation}} game, {{which uses}} cardboard counters {{to represent the}} ships, shuttles, seeking weapons, terrain, and information on a hexagonal map. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a game, but rather a detailed game system for two or more players (there are some solitaire scenarios). Typically, a player will have one ship in a game, though they can control an entire fleet, if they can {{keep track of the}} paperwork and options involved; multiple players can play as teams, with each team splitting up the work of running a squadron or fleet, or a 'free-for-all' fight can be run. Ships represented in the game are typically starships from such classic Star Trek powers as the Federation, Romulan Star Empire, Klingon Empire, or purely Star Fleet Universe creations such as the Hydran Kingdom or Interstellar Concordium.|$|E

500|$|This work's title, {{translatable}} as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ {{as the teacher}} of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to control our passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E
500|$|Theodor W. Adorno's Jargon of Authenticity (1964) {{suggested}} that the poems are essentially evil: [...] "The fact that the neoromantic lyric sometimes behaves like the jargon , or at least timidly readies the way for it, should not lead us {{to look for the}} evil of the poetry simply in its form. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> grounded, as a much too innocent view might maintain, in the mixture of poetry and prose. The evil, in the neoromantic lyric, consists in the fitting out of the words with a theological overtone, which is belied by the condition of the lonely and secular subject who is speaking there: religion as ornament." [...] Adorno further believed the poems reinforced the German value of commitment that supported a cultural attraction towards the principles of Nazism.|$|E
500|$|Bull's Bridge is very {{significant}} and important {{as one of}} three surviving covered bridges {{in the state of}} Connecticut. The other two surviving bridges exhibit designs that are different from Bull's Bridge. Though the West Cornwall Covered Bridge was constructed with a Town lattice, the design was reinforced and altered to give it a unique appearance, though it also has two uneven length spans and a gable roof. The Comstock's Bridge is not in use, but exhibits Howe truss design. The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, which stated that, [...] "No effort should be spared to assure its preservation for the indefinite future, especially as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a museum piece but is daily serving a considerable volume of traffic on a route that, if eliminated, would compel a lengthy and inconvenient detour northward or southward to reach the destinations served by this road."

2500|$|Rules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; {{they do not}} in fact “generate” anything. They serve {{merely to}} {{describe}} regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates ... why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict “history” – i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game. Why? Because the “system” involves more than {{the rules of the}} game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among {{a very large number of}} available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by teleonomic, cybernetic, feedback-driven influences. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, “purposeful” activity.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, Schiller appears {{very similar}} to James. However, Schiller’s more {{stringent}} requirement that meaningful statements have consequences [...] "to some one for some purpose" [...] makes Schiller’s position more extreme than James’. For Schiller, {{it is not a}} sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person’s goals at a specific moment in time {{if it is to be}} meaningful. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> enough that the statement [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and the statement [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that the experiential difference makes a difference to someone’s purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If the experiential difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and then [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing.
