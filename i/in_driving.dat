5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> the extinction, and suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
50|$|Turn lanes allow {{vehicles}} to cross oncoming traffic (i.e., {{a left turn}} <b>in</b> right-side <b>driving</b> countries, or a right turn <b>in</b> left-side <b>driving</b> countries), or to exit a road without crossing traffic (i.e., a right turn <b>in</b> right-side <b>driving</b> countries, or a left turn <b>in</b> left-side <b>driving</b> countries). Absence of a turn lane does not normally indicate a prohibition of turns in that direction. Instead, traffic control signs are used to prohibit specific turns.|$|R

5|$|Through {{the first}} round she led the field <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> accuracy, was in the top 20 in greens in regulation, and was 84th out of 111 <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> distance.

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US troops on Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure the city would occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Mercer, {{leading the}} American advance guard, {{encountered}} British soldiers from Princeton {{under the command}} of Charles Mawhood. The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle, Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.|$|E
5|$|Mine owners {{still holding}} out for the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners not {{to interfere with the}} operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially attempted to persuade these men to join the union and strike, but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> non-union miners out of the district.|$|E
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans.

5|$|The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery served several other roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell {{might be able}} to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems.

5|$|As part of Operation Bowery, Eagle rendezvoused on {{the night}} of 7/8May with the American carrier , {{carrying}} 47 Spitfires, while Eagle had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own. Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return. After they had landed, the ship was attacked by a half-dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits. The radar-guided guns of the escorting light cruiser, , were instrumental <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> off the determined Italian aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> off the French, {{who retired in}} the face of his superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On the way to the Portuguese Coast, Balchen finally made his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a battered and leaking condition until, a few days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She was also very new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. <b>In</b> <b>driving</b> forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E

5|$|Chef is a 2014 American comedy-drama film written, co-produced, and {{directed}} by Jon Favreau, who stars with Sofía Vergara, John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, Dustin Hoffman, and Robert Downey Jr. Favreau plays a professional chef who, after a public altercation with a food critic, quits his job at a popular Los Angeles restaurant and returns to his hometown of Miami to fix up a food truck.

5|$|Darlington {{moved to}} the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was a major factor <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> the club into {{administration}}. In May 2012, the club was bought out of a period of administration without entering into a Creditors Voluntary Agreement (CVA). The Football Association ruled {{that it should be}} treated as a new club, which required a change of playing name. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that team was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request to revert to their traditional name.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings <b>in</b> <b>driving</b> accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
