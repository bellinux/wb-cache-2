2500|$|In some cases, {{a stitch}} may be {{deliberately}} left unsecured {{by a new}} <b>stitch</b> and its <b>wale</b> allowed to disassemble. [...] This is known as drop-stitch knitting, and produces a vertical ladder of see-through holes in the fabric, corresponding to where the wale had been.|$|R

2500|$|In {{securing}} the previous <b>stitch</b> in a <b>wale,</b> the next <b>stitch</b> can {{pass through the}} previous loop from either below or above. [...] If the former, the stitch is denoted as a 'knit stitch' or a 'plain stitch;' if the latter, as a 'purl stitch'. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the height}} of Dieges & Clust's {{production}} were the 1920s trophies known in sports collecting circles as [...] "The Five Figural Spalding Baseball Trophies". The various trophies depict a baseball player pitching, catching, batting, playing first base, or playing in the outfield. The proportions of the figures and the detail (of the <b>faces,</b> fingers, <b>stitching</b> in the baseball gloves and shoelaces) are remarkable [...] They fetch up to $5,000 at auction, relatively high for a silver-plated trophy on a wooden base.|$|R
50|$|On August 26, 1959, <b>Stitch</b> <b>faced</b> future World Welterweight Champion Luis Manuel Rodriguez at the State Fairgrounds Coliseum in Louisville.

50|$|Each funeral deposit is {{constituted}} by a mummy in seated position, wrapped in both flat and decorated textiles. In the lake of the mummies there were ceramics and other artifacts found that are {{traced back to}} the Incas. When excavating the lake of the Mummies in group one there were six mausoleums found each consisting of cubed shaped enclosures placed right next to each other in a row. The tombs were housed in caves that contained paintings on the walls that were related to the mausoleums and contained symbols that were indecipherable. The enclosures were built with only three walls the fourth being the rock wall. The enclosures had two floors and on the top level a window was found. The purpose of the window was to renew the air to prevent the mummies to corrupt by the moisture. The mummies found in the tomb were placed in a seating position. The mummies have unique coffins that contain a human <b>faced</b> <b>stitched</b> on it. Based {{on the size of the}} funeral it appears that they were of small creatures. The mummification process of the tombs were done with sophisticated techniques in order to preserve the bodies due to high humidity in the Amazon Andes. In the tombs there were various cultural objects found such as pottery, textiles, wood carvings the size of statues, clothing, silver, personal ornaments, and even ceremonial objects used in their rituals.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding <b>stitches</b> to each <b>wale</b> in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|R
50|$|Interviewed {{about the}} fight by HBO, doctor Paul Wallace {{explained}} his decision:"When {{he raised his}} head up, his upper eyelid covered his field of vision. At that point I had no other option but to stop the fight. If he had to move his head to see me, {{there was no way he}} could defend his way against a punch."Klitschko's <b>face</b> required sixty <b>stitches.</b>|$|R
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final <b>stitches</b> in a <b>wale,</b> one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|R
500|$|In {{the scene}} in which Snow White is {{captured}} by The Queen's henchmen, Goodwin tweeted that the horse ran right into her, sending her flying and injuring her hand and face. Goodwin explained that [...] "we go on quite an adventure and I came away with an actual, physical scar from it." [...] The incident required that the actress' <b>face</b> receive <b>stitches</b> in a hospital emergency room. Goodwin and Joshua Dallas {{said that it was}} their favorite episode up to that point, with Dallas saying it was [...] "lot of fun to shoot and it’s just great." [...] In another tweet, Goodwin commented that Jennifer Morrison taught her to perform CPR during a scene with Dallas, as Morrison learned the procedure while she was a regular on House M.D.|$|R
50|$|On August 7, 2016, the 10-year-old son of Kansas state {{representative}} Scott Schwab died while riding Verrückt. The boy was decapitated when the raft went airborne and impacted a metal support bar. He {{was one of}} three passengers with two women, one of whom suffered a broken jaw and the other a broken <b>face</b> bone requiring <b>stitches.</b> The park closed following the incident, pending an inspection. On August 10, 2016, the park reopened, but the ride remained closed indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for calendering, the fabric is folded lengthwise {{with the front}} side, or <b>face,</b> inside, and <b>stitched</b> together along the edges. The fabric can be folded together at full width, however this is not done as often as it is more difficult. The fabric is then run through rollers that polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous. High temperatures and pressure are used as well. Fabrics that go through the calendering process feel thin, glossy and papery.|$|R
5000|$|Werenski {{was injured}} in Game 3 of the First Round against the Pittsburgh Penguins when a puck on a shot from Phil Kessel rode up the shaft of his stick and {{hit him in the}} <b>face.</b> He {{received}} <b>stitches</b> and a black eye but returned to the game in the third period only to leave again when his eye closed over. [...] Officials did not stop the play when he was hit and it resulted as a goal for the Penguins. He was not able to play {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs.|$|R
5000|$|Flaherty, Schmitz's ex-girlfriend who {{was among}} those {{verbally}} assaulting McDonald and her friends outside the bar, was charged in May 2012 with second-degree {{assault with a deadly}} weapon and third-degree assault causing substantial bodily harm for attacking McDonald with [...] "an alcoholic drink" [...] glass causing a bleeding gash to her <b>face</b> needing eleven <b>stitches.</b> Her case was referred to the Washington County Attorney's Office in order to avoid a conflict of interest. In April 2013, Flaherty was sentenced to six months' jail time and probation after pleading guilty to third-degree assault, and was given credit for 135 days served in jail.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, in a November 15, 1953 {{game against}} the 49ers, Otto Graham took an elbow from linebacker Art Michalik that put a gash on his <b>face</b> {{requiring}} 15 <b>stitches.</b> Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic mask and he was sent back on the field. While the use of face masks was not unheard-of – Y.A. Tittle was using one that season as he nursed a fractured cheekbone – the injury contributed to their development. Brown is often credited with inventing and patenting the single-bar face mask. Riddell, a sports equipment manufacturer, claims the [...] "bar tubular" [...] mask was invented by G.E. Morgan for Graham in 1955, although {{by the end of}} that year many players were already wearing some form of face protection.|$|R
5000|$|Voiced by Linda Cook in the original, Frank Welker in Dollman vs. Demonic Toys, {{and then}} by the singer Jane Wiedlin in the latest movie, respectively. The leader of the toys. A foul-mouthed, perverted baby doll. In the first film, Baby Oopsie Daisy is female, but in the sequel she grows a penis, turning her into a male (though still wears the female dress from the first film in [...] "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys"). In the first movie, she was just a killer baby doll that used weapons such as knives and guns. In Dollman vs. Demonic Toys, Baby Oopsie gained the power to send corpses to the toy's master in Hell. In Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys, the doll is again male and can fart and leap very high. It's the only film where the baby does not get killed. He {{is also one of the}} two toys (the other being Jack Attack) to appear in all of the Demonic Toys movies to date. He's the only Demonic Toy that said his name and can speak. In Demonic Toys 2, its name is changed to Baby Whoopsie, and his <b>face</b> is <b>stitched</b> up as a {{possible}} nod to Chucky from the Child's Play franchise.|$|R
5|$|The Pros {{started their}} season in week three with {{a game against}} the Rock Island Independents. The Independents already played two games and were undefeated. There were no scores by either team in the first or third quarters, but the Independents scored 13 points in the second and fourth. Running backs Fred Chicken, Ray Kuehl, and Gerald Mansfield {{accounting}} for four touchdowns throughout the game. Quarterback Pudge Wyman throw two touchdowns—a 35-yard one to Kuehl and a 20-yard one to Mansfield. Hammond started to purposely injure their opponents during the game because they realized the Independents were a much greater team. As a result, Rube Ursella suffered a twisted knee. Duey Lyle was kicked in the face and required seven stitches. Lastly, Ed Healey was kicked in the <b>face</b> needed five <b>stitches</b> in the cheek.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the two {{devise a}} hula {{based on the}} legend of Hi'iaka. Lilo gets {{increasingly}} mad at Stitch as he ruins their practice sessions. To make matters worse, Jumba is having problems creating the fusion chamber because he doesn't have the proper alien technology to build one and must resort to using mere household objects. However, just before the competition, Stitch arrives just before Lilo is to perform, wishing her luck. The two make up as Jumba finally completes the fusion chamber. However, Stitch has another abrupt fit. Lilo, confused, tries {{to come up to}} him, causing Stitch to accidentally scratch her <b>face.</b> After this, <b>Stitch</b> becomes greatly upset that he hurt her. Knowing that Stitch would never want to voluntarily hurt her, Lilo finally realizes that something is wrong with him. Lilo tries to ask what's wrong, but Stitch runs off to leave Earth, believing himself to be too dangerous. In the middle of her performance, Lilo runs off to help him.|$|R
50|$|On November 26, 1958, <b>Stitch</b> <b>faced</b> Yama Bahama, {{a veteran}} with fifty-two {{professional}} victories, at the Exposition Center in Louisville. Stitch, {{who was the}} betting underdog, defeated Bahama by a ten-round unanimous decision. On December 28, 1958, Stitch defeated middleweight Chico Vejar by a ten-round unanimous decision at the Jefferson County Armory in Louisville. He gave away 11½ pounds to Vejar, a winner of eighty-three professional fights. Stitch's first fight with Gasper Ortega, which took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 6, 1959, illustrated his character. In the third round, there was an accidental clash of heads. Stitch wasn't hurt, but Ortega was staggering around. Stitch backed away and let Ortega's head clear: he didn't believe in taking advantage of an opponent in such a situation. Ortega {{went on to win}} by a ten-round split decision, but Stitch's sportsmanship earned him much respect. On May 8, 1959, they had a rematch in Syracuse, New York, and Stitch won by a ten-round unanimous decision.|$|R
5000|$|Police first {{attempted}} arrests near Telegraph Ave and William St. This attempt failed when protestors {{were ordered}} to disperse. As police attempted to clear the protesters, the marchers overturned a chain link fence and fled across a vacant park. The march continued heading up Telegraph towards 20th. Three officers were injured in the skirmish between Occupy protesters, as protesters threw bottles, metal pipe, rocks, spray cans, improvised explosive devices, and lit flares, police said, in a large skirmish {{on the front steps}} of the Oakland Museum of California. The most seriously injured officer received a cut to his <b>face</b> that required <b>stitches</b> after a protester hit him with a bicycle. The other two injured officers received bruises, and one injured his hand. Police again stopped the march on Broadway between 23rd and 24th. Police announced over loudspeaker to the kettled crowd: [...] "Marchers, you have failed to disperse after several lawful orders. You are now under arrest". There were 409 arrests at Occupy Oakland on January 28, but only 12 of those arrested were charged.|$|R
40|$|Face {{recognition}} from video {{has been extensively}} studied in recent years. Intuitively, video provides more information than a single image. But problems such as variation in pose and occlusion still remain. When a face is partially occluded, handling the occluded part of the face is an especially challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognize a face from video based on face patches. First, face patches are cropped from the video frame by frame. Then, face patches are matched to an overall <b>face</b> model and <b>stitched</b> together. By accumulating the patches, a reconstructed face is built which is used in recognition. We test our method in two experiments. In the first experiment, a still face database is used by randomly occluding parts of the face and using the remaining face patches in recognition. The experiments show that our method achieves a comparable recognition rate with the recognition rate from the whole face image. In the second experiment, the method is tested on video sequences. We reach a recognition rate of 81 %, while there is still missing data in the reconstructed face. Index Terms — image registration, image reconstruction, face recognition 1...|$|R
50|$|Scourfield {{was born}} in Pontypridd in 1909 before moving to Ynysybwl. In 1930 Scourfield was {{selected}} for his one and only appearance for Wales {{in a game against}} France as part of the 1930 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Guy Morgan, Scourfield made the trip to Paris to play the French at Stade Colombes. The game was an extremely bad-tempered affair from a French team well known throughout the 1930s for their rough play. The game took {{a turn for the worse}} when Scourfield collected a loose ball from the back and kicked it into touch. One of the French players who was chasing the ball, ignored the fact that the ball was cleared, continued his race towards Scourfield and punched him in the head. Later on Bert Day, the Welsh hooker, was kicked in the <b>face</b> requiring nine <b>stitches.</b> When Welsh forward Tom Arthur retaliated on the wrong French player, the game fell into running fist fights, with the referee having to halt the game on several occasions. Wales won the game 11-0, but Scourfield did not represent his country again.|$|R
50|$|The Cowboys {{continued}} {{to drive up}} the score during the 3rd quarter with a 5-yard touchdown run by RB Julius Jones. During this play Titans' DT Albert Haynesworth stepped {{on the face of}} Cowboys center Andre Gurode. Haynesworth was flagged for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and ejected from the game. He protested his ejection by taking off his helmet and throwing it on the ground. He was then flagged again with another Unsportsmanlike Conduct penalty. Gurode left the field with an ice pack to his <b>face</b> and required <b>stitched</b> above his left eye. He did not return to the field. Head Coach Jeff Fisher as well as Haynesworth later apologized for his actions. Vince Young connected for his second touchdown of the year to TE Ben Troupe. During the 4th quarter, the Cowboys scored on a field goal by Mike Vanderjagt. LB Brady James intercepted Vince Young's pass intended for Ben Troupe and returned it for a touchdown. The Cowboys sealed the win with a 7-yard TD run by Tyson Thompson with a final score of 45 to 14. The Cowboys moved to 2 and 1 while the Titans {{continued to}} losing streak dropping to 0-4.|$|R
5000|$|At about 7:40 a.m. on March 5, 2015, Lippert was {{attacked}} by a knife-wielding man at a restaurant attached to Sejong Center in downtown Seoul, where Lippert was scheduled {{to give a speech}} {{at a meeting of the}} Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation. The assailant, Kim Ki-jong, is a member of Uri Madang, a progressive cultural organization opposed to the Korean War. He inflicted wounds on Lippert's left arm as well as a four-inch cut on the right side of the ambassador's <b>face,</b> requiring 80 <b>stitches.</b> Lippert underwent surgery at Yonsei University's Severance Hospital in Seoul. While his injuries were not life-threatening, doctors stated that it would take several months for Lippert to regain use of his fingers. A police official said that the knife used in the attack was 10 in long [...] and Lippert later reported that the blade penetrated to within 2 cm of his carotid artery. ABC News summarized the immediate aftermath of the attack as follows: [...] "Ambassador Lippert, an Iraq war veteran, defended himself from the attack. Lippert was rushed to a hospital where he was treated for deep cuts to his face, his arm, and his hand... He kept his cool throughout the incident." ...|$|R
5000|$|Woody is {{an old-fashioned}} pull-string cowboy doll. The voice-box that is {{activated}} by the pull-string says many simple {{phrases such as}} [...] "Reach for the sky!", [...] "You're my favorite deputy!", [...] "There's a snake in my boots!", and [...] "Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!". As mentioned in Toy Story 2, his construction includes an [...] "original hand-painted <b>face,</b> natural dyed-blanket <b>stitched</b> vest, and hand-stitched poly-vinyl hat." [...] Woody wears an empty gun holster at his belt. He is Andy's favorite toy since kindergarten, with a special spot on the bed, and {{is the leader of}} the toys in Andy's room. In Toy Story 2, it is revealed that he is based on the main character from a popular 1950s TV show, Woody's Roundup. When Al is bargaining with Andy's mom in an attempt to take Woody, Andy's mom declines Al's bargain, stating that Woody is [...] "an old family toy." [...] Stinky Pete also directly refers to him as a [...] "hand-me-down cowboy doll" [...] later in the movie, and when Woody finds a record player in Al's apartment room, he states [...] "I haven't seen one of these in ages!", again supporting that he has been around longer than Andy. In fact, when introducing the 2009 set of Toy Story collectibles, John Lasseter said [...] "We always imagined he was a hand-me-down to Andy from his father." [...] He is voiced by Tom Hanks in the films and by his brother Jim Hanks on other occasions.|$|R
50|$|After {{they have}} {{successfully}} captured all the remaining experiments {{prior to the}} events of Leroy & Stitch (2006), the Grand Councilwoman offered Stitch the chance to become the captain of the Galactic Armada and its new flagship, The BRB (Big Red Battleship) 9000. However, that would require Stitch to be separated from Lilo. Not wanting to make Lilo sad, he chooses to return to Kaua'i but Lilo tells him he should go. Before he leaves with Jumba and Pleakley, Lilo gives him a necklace with a tiki of the god Ku Tiki to give him strength. When Gantu breaks out Dr. Hämsterviel in an action of frustration, Stitch is sent on his first mission to capture the evil rodent once more. But when he arrives at Galactic Defense Industries, <b>Stitch</b> <b>faces</b> off against a new experiment — Leroy, who is an enhanced clone of Stitch. Stitch fights well and is about to beat Leroy when Pleakley shows up unexpectedly, allowing Leroy to take advantage of Stitch's lapse in concentration and beat him. He is placed in a cage and sent with Jumba and Pleakley heading towards a black hole. After they are sent towards the black hole, Leroy heads off towards Earth to capture all of the other experiments for Hämsterviel. Later, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley escape from the black hole, and arrive on the planet Turo. There they rescue Lilo, 625 (now known as Reuben), and Gantu, and fly Pleakley's carpool van back to Earth to assist the other 624 experiments in the defeat of an army of Leroys. Now, with Leroy defeated, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley return to Earth with Lilo, realizing family is more important than spaceships, laboratories, and prestige.|$|R
