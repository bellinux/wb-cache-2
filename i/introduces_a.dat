5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It {{involves}} {{absorbing the}} souls of enemies {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player.

5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E
5|$|In Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams {{the band}} experimented with {{different}} instruments and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of styles. The album mixes experimental instrumentation with elements both symphonic and electronic, {{and the music}} <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> minimalist approach full of ethereal sonics. The record carries the concept album format of This Is War and expands the spectrum to revolve around the themes after which it is named.|$|E
5|$|Ocarina of Times {{music was}} written by Koji Kondo, the {{composer}} in charge of music {{for most of the}} games in The Legend of Zelda series. In addition to characters having musical themes, areas of Hyrule are also associated with pieces of music. This has been called leitmotif in reverse—instead of music announcing an entering character, it now <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> stationary environment as the player approaches. In some locations, the music is a variation of an ocarina tune the player learns, related to that area.|$|E

5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> supernatural element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
