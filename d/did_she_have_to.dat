25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E

For {{the first time in}} her life she could lie abed till breakfast was on the table. And what a bed!--clean and soft, and {{comfortable}} as no bed she had ever known. And such food! Flour, cooked into biscuits, hot-cakes and bread, three times a day and every day, and all one wanted! Such prodigality was hardly believable.|$|E

6000|$|This {{young lady}} {{came back in}} black velvet--the gown was rather rusty and very low on her lean shoulders--and with a Japanese fan in her red hands.

60|$|She nodded. Taylor {{turned the}} rough, thin sheets of newspaper. His good mood had soured on him. Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fret all the time? They were pretty well off, as things went. You couldn't {{expect to have}} {{everything}} perfect, living undersurface, with an artificial sun and artificial food. Naturally it was a strain, not seeing the sky or {{being able to go}} any place or see anything other than metal walls, great roaring factories, the plant-yards, barracks. But it was better than being on surface. And some day it would end and they could return. Nobody wanted to live this way, but it was necessary.|$|E

Edwards, Kendricks, and Melvin Franklin share the lead on [...] "Love is a Hurtin' Thing", while [...] "I Gotta Find a Way (To Get You Back)" [...] is a showcase for Edwards alone. Paul Williams is given two solo numbers, [...] "Hey Girl" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Him Take Your Love From Me", re-recorded as an upbeat single for The Four Tops the same year. The ballad [...] "Gonna Keep on Tryin' Till I Win Your Love", led by Edwards, would later be re-recorded by the group in 1971 for the Sky's the Limit LP, with Kendricks on lead.|$|E
5000|$|Another reviewer, for American Anthropologist, was {{somewhat}} {{critical of the}} work, commenting {{that he would have}} liked to have seen more information and discussion in the book, using Karla Slocum's conversational interview style as an example and stated that she did notexplain whether it mattered that she was not, in fact, a market woman who had to compete with her informants in the marketplace, nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> survive on the proceeds of her labor there. Like her professional colleagues, she chose to be a participant-observer and could choose to terminate the experiment at will." ...|$|E

After participating in the bombardment of enemy shore positions on Minami Daito Shima 28 March, she sailed for Okinawa. Landings were made on the Japanese fortress 1 April, with Task Force 58 providing support, and Haynsworth frequently aiding {{in the destruction of}} enemy aircraft during the many attacks, where [...] "the fleet had come to stay."

Caster Semenya, a talented middle-distance runner, carried the South African flag at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. The road she travelled {{to get to this}} Olympics was a particularly challenging one as not only <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> qualify, she also had to prove that she was a woman. I've learned two things about gender testing and sport that I found interesting. First, there is no definitive gender test. And second, only women's sport worries about gender testing...|$|E

After analyzing the reports the authors had mixed views about the results, the correct interpretation of Melanie's claims and her introspective accuracy. Even after long discussion the two authors disagreed with each other in the closing remarks, Schwitzgebel being pessimistic and Hurlburt optimistic about the reliability of introspection.|$|R
