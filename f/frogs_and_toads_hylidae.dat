50|$|The two friends, <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad,</b> {{are portrayed}} {{by the author}} with human-like personalities and {{amphibian}} appearance.

50|$|FrogWatch USA is a {{national}} citizen science program through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) for monitoring local <b>frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>toad</b> populations. The amphibian staff of the Detroit Zoological Society train citizen scientists to collect data about Michigan <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> by identifying their calls. These data are then included in the national AZA database {{as well as the}} Michigan Department of Natural Resources herp atlas to help monitor the distribution and population trends for <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads.</b> If you are interested in contributing to <b>frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>toad</b> conservation from your backyard to across Michigan, join the local monitoring team. Training opportunities occur every February and March.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of traffic {{intensity}} on local abundance of anurans. We counted dead <b>and</b> live <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> per km <b>and</b> estimated <b>frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>toad</b> local abundances using breeding chorus intensities on similar roads through similar habitats, but with different levels of traffic intensity. After correcting for effects of date, local habitat, time, and region, our analyses demonstrated that (1) the number of dead <b>and</b> live <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> per km decreased with increasing traffic intensity; (2) the proportion of <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> dead increased with increasing traffic intensity; <b>and</b> (3) the <b>frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>toad</b> density, {{as measured by the}} chorus intensity, decreased with increasing traffic intensity. Taken together, our results indicate that traffic mortality has a significant negative effect on the local density of anurans. Our results suggest that recent increases in traffic volumes worldwide are probably contributing to declines in amphibian populations, particularly in populated areas...|$|R
