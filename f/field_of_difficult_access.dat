50|$|This {{pygmy owl}} inhabits primary or {{slightly}} altered cloud forests in mountainous regions of high rainfall and steep slopes. It is not actually restricted to primary forests {{and is at}} least capable of persisting in altered habitats. Its habitat can be <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> for humans, but can also be prone to natural fragmentation. Thus, like other species that are tied to cloud forest, it is known only from very small range.|$|R

Portions {{of most of the}} systems remain largely pristine, and many are currently filled with fine grained sediments. These systems are located mostly on Arizona State and Coronado National Forest lands that remain largely undeveloped. While often <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access,</b> major canal portions are usually easily traced. There are few access roads and fewer mesa top trails.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally the {{adjacent}} Wa States had been administered by a Sawbwa, a Shan hereditary chief who resided in Mang Lon. In {{the second half}} of the 19th century the British authorities in Burma judged the Wa territory remote and <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> and, excepting Mang Lon, they left the Wa States without administration, its border with China undefined. That situation suited the Wa well, for throughout their history they had consistently preferred being left alone.|$|R

Accurate diagnosis often cannot be done preoperatively and imaging studies such as computed tomography and especially magnetic resonance imaging can define the size and anatomical relationships of the lesions. Surgical treatment is challenging because <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> <b>of</b> the region which is preferably performed by posterior approach. We describe the etiology, diagnosis and operative technique of tumors of the ischiorectal fossa...|$|R

Usually the system is off-the-grid because <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> or lack <b>of</b> infrastructure. [...] Fuel cell or other backup power systems are added to critical cell sites to provide emergency power. More sites use internal-combustion-engine-driven generator sets.However, being less efficient than public power, they increase operating expense and {{are a source of}} pollution (atmospheric, acoustic, etc.) and some are in areas protected by environment and landscape conservation.|$|R
5000|$|... == History == In 1879 the Melrose Estate {{was put up}} for auction. The {{land had}} belonged to Alexander Sutherland who died in 1877, and was sold to Mace and Jackson and then a {{syndicate}} known as Melrose Proprietors. Like James Coutts Crawford’s subdivision of the Seatoun township on the Miramar Peninsula, there were few buyers because <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access.</b> Crawford's earlier auction of Kilbirnie sections in 1874 had attracted mainly speculators buying cheap land rather than would-be homeowners.|$|R

The famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang also travelled the city in the 7th century. He described its position as [...] "The Capital was 15 li in circuit. It's position was lofty, and <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access,</b> and it was surronded by groves, tanks and fishponds". Kashipur is believed to have a good historic trade of clothes and metal vessels.|$|R
60|$|The city of Delphi {{was built}} upon the lower declivities of the Parnassian ranges, and yet {{high above the}} {{surrounding}} country. It {{was built in the}} form of an amphitheater, in a sort of lap in the hill where it stood, with steep precipices descending to a great depth on either side. It was thus a position <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access,</b> and was considered almost impregnable in respect to its military strength. Besides its natural defenses, it was considered as under the special protection of Apollo.|$|R

Arrived there, our party, knowing that a public conveyance in Italy--and everywhere else--always stops at the worst inn in a place, made bold to seek another, and found it without ado, though the person who undertook to show it spoke of it mysteriously and as <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access,</b> {{and tried to make}} the simple affair as like a scene of grand opera as he could.|$|R
30|$|The rate of {{laparotomy}} conversion decreased {{greatly from}} 12 % to 0.6 %. These rates {{are similar in}} literature (0 – 11 %) as well as reasons for conversion (adhesions, <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> to promontory and hypercapnia) [7, 8, 16 – 18]. This {{may be due to}} better mastery and standardisation of techniques for surgeons but also anaesthetists and all the operating staff [5, 6]. Hypercapnia and <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> to the promontory are no more an indication for conversion in group B. This may also be due to better selection of patients: vaginal route immediately chosen in case of surgical antecedent or foreseeable surgical difficulties. In case <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> to promontory, alternative techniques, such as Dubuisson’s, with lateral suspension, will be used which avoids laparotomy conversion and gives good anatomic results [19].|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{continuous}} time model of maturation and survival, obtained as {{the limit of}} a compartmental evolution model {{when the number of}} compartments tends to infinity. We establish in particular an explicit formula for the law of the system output under inhomogeneous killing and when the input follows a time-inhomogeneous Poisson process. This approach allows the discussion of identifiability issues which are <b>of</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>access</b> for finite compartmental models. The article ends up with an example of application for anticancer drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.
