40|$|A new {{approach}} to generate the original motion data for humanoid motion planning is presented in this paper. And a <b>state</b> <b>generator</b> is developed based on the genetic algorithm, which enables users to generate various motion states without using any reference motion data. By specifying various types of constraints such as configuration constraints and contact constraints, the <b>state</b> <b>generator</b> can generate stable states that satisfy the constraint conditions for humanoid robots. To deal with the multiple constraints and inverse kinematics, the state generation is finally simplified as a problem of optimizing and searching. In our method, we introduce a convenient mathematic representation for the constraints involved in the <b>state</b> <b>generator,</b> and solve the optimization problem with the genetic algorithm to acquire a desired state. To demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the method, a number of motion states are generated {{according to the requirements}} of the motion...|$|R

Based {{on the design of}} the framework and the <b>state</b> <b>generator</b> in Chays et al's paper[1], we have designed the input generator to generate inputs (test cases) for database applications. Part of the test cases are based on the state, and the other part are independent. We have implemented a more realistic database application, the <b>state</b> <b>generator</b> and the input generator. Our experiment shows that the two sets of test cases are complementary to each other. We also notice that it is not straight forward to generate an initial state so that the inputs generated can cover possible situations for the application as many as possible. We also suggest the need to automatically compute expected outputs and to enhance Chays et al. 's design of the <b>state</b> <b>generator,</b> which cannot handle many important kinds of constraints that can be specified in a database schema. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to perform {{symbolic}} state space generation for languages with existing enumerative <b>state</b> <b>generators.</b> The method is largely independent from the chosen modelling language. We validated this on three different types of languages and tools: state-based languages (PROMELA), action-based process algebras (µCRL, mCRL 2), and discrete abstractions of ODEs (Maple). Only little information about the combinatorial structure of the underlying model checking problem needs to be provided. The key enabling data structure is the “PINS ” dependency matrix. Moreover, it can be provided gradually (more precise information yields better results). Second, in addition to symbolic reachability, the same PINS matrix contains enough information to enable new optimizations in state space generation (local transition caching), again independent from the chosen modelling language. We have also based existing optimizations, like (recursive) state collapsing, on top of PINS and hint at how to support partial order reduction techniques. Third, PINS allows interfacing of existing <b>state</b> <b>generators</b> to, e. g., distributed reachability tools. Thus, besides the stated novelties, the method we propose also significantly reduces the complexity of building modular yet still efficient model checking tools. Our experiments show that we can match or even outperform existing tools by reusing their own <b>state</b> <b>generators,</b> which we have linked into an implementation of our ideas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, cache locking have {{appeared}} {{as a solution to}} ease the schedulability analysis of real-time systems using cache memories maintaining, at the same time, similar performance improvements than regular cache memories. New devices for the embedded market couple a processor and a programmable logic device designed to enhance system flexibility and increase the possibilities of customisation in the field. This arrangement may help to improve the use of cache locking in real-time systems. This work proposes the use of this embedded programmable logic device to implement a logic function that provides the cache controller the information it needs in order to determine if a referenced main memory block has to be loaded and locked into the cache; we have called this circuit a Locking <b>State</b> <b>Generator.</b> Experiments show the requirements in terms of number of hardware resources and a way to reduce them and the circuit complexity.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the quantum complexity class FQMA. This class describes {{the complexity of}} generating a quantum state {{that serves as a}} witness for a given QMA problem. In a certain sense, FQMA is the quantum analogue of FNP (function problems associated with NP). The latter describes the complexity of finding a succinct proof for a NP decision problem. Whereas all FNP problems can be reduced to NP, there is no obvious reduction of FQMA to QMA since the solution of FQMA is a quantum state and the solution of QMA the answer yes or no. We consider quantum <b>state</b> <b>generators</b> that get classical descriptions of 3 -local Hamiltonians on n qubits as input and prepare low energy states for these systems as output. We show that such <b>state</b> <b>generators</b> can be used to prepare witnesses for QMA problems. Hence low energy state preparation is FQMA-complete. Our proofs are extensions of the proofs by Kitaev et al. and Kempe and Regev for the QMA-completeness of k-local Hamiltonian problems. We show that FQMA can be solved by preparing thermal equilibrium states with an appropriate temperature decreasing as the reciprocal of a polynomial in n. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
