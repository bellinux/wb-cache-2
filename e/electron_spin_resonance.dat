Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. <b>Electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs.

It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. <b>Electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E

Lithium and liquid ammonia (Birch) reduction applied to melanins from wool and L-DOPA gave very different results, as reflected by ESR spectra, but {{in both cases the}} changes were much greater than those produced by other treatments. In general, reductive treatments in nonaqueous media in the presence of metals increase the free radical content and line width, whereas treatment in aqueous media resulted in decreased free radical content.

The similarity of the e. s. r. spectra of iron ATP and of iron and manganese RNA, except for hyperfine spectrum (hfs) in the latter, suggests that the two ions bind similarly in the two compounds.

The drawbacks of metallic implant and autograft/allograft use have steered therapeutic approaches towards tissue engineering solutions involving tissue regeneration scaffolds.

The biodegradable scaffold composed of porous beta-tricalcium phosphate particles and collagen type I fibers is prepared from a mixture of collagen type-I and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) particles via lyophilization, followed by dehydrothermal (DHT) processing.
