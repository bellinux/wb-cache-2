5|$|Circle Explorer: Similar to oneworld Explorer, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{travel to}} North or South America, {{so you can}} fly halfway around the globe and then back again, without {{actually}} circumnavigating the planet (for example, London-Hong Kong-Sydney-Johannesburg-London).|$|E

5|$|Proponents of Magic Lantern {{argue the}} {{technology}} would allow {{law enforcement to}} efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes.

50|$|Passive {{treatment}} {{systems are}} a valuable option for treating acid mine drainage at remote locations.

5|$|The {{derivation}} of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence {{from the}} Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the dimension axiom, so {{in addition to}} existing in ordinary cohomology theories, it holds in extraordinary cohomology theories (such as topological K-theory and cobordism).|$|E

5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.

The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> faith.|$|E
5|$|The American economy, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a {{labor force}} {{consisting}} solely of professionals.
