5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E

25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|Before 1941, the {{shipyard}} {{at what is}} now Pier 70 produced some of its best ships. By the late 1930s, though, with war looming, Bethlehem began to modernize and upgrade the Potrero Yard. A number of new buildings were constructed, {{and by the time}} World War II began Potrero {{was one of the most}} productive shipyards in the country. During World War Two, the government once again took over the Potrero Point yards for the war effort. During the war, up to 4,000 men and women were employed, working three shifts a day. Finding skilled workers during wartime was a huge challenge, and much was done to train new workers, and to organize shipbuilding so that less skilled people could <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> highly skilled people had done before. At the height of the war effort productivity was tremendous: the destroyer escort Fieberling was built in 24 days, start to finish. Though Liberty ships and other simpler ships could be built faster, to build a modern warship in that amount of time was an incredible achievement. During the war, Bethlehem's Potrero yard produced 72 vessels (52 for combat) and repaired over 2,500 navy and commercial craft.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 the Council {{considered}} further {{reform of}} the court system to deal with growing backlogs in the Chancery Division {{and the cost of}} appeals to the House of Lords. They recommended the establishment of a Commercial Court, the creation of a Court of Criminal Appeal to take over from the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, a better division of work between the Chancery Division and Queen's Bench Division, an additional judge for the Chancery Division and the Attorney General of England and Wales to be given power to appeal against overly lenient sentencing, all of which were eventually put into practice. After this the council met irregularly; only twice between 1900 and 1907. There was a ten-year gap between meetings in 1940 and 1950 respectively, and little was done. The original Judges' Council was eventually indirectly dissolved in 1981, with the Supreme Court Act 1981, which unlike previous Acts of Parliament contained no provisions allowing for the Council's continued existence. Denis Dobson, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, suggested this was because other bodies now existed to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Council had been created to achieve.|$|E

500|$|Four screenwriters {{worked on}} the property. Peter Hedges wrote the first draft, but didn't think he could do more; another writer passed. Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ...

500|$|Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago, were hired as the producers for Hairspray, and began discussing possibly casting John Travolta and Billy Crystal (or Jim Broadbent) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively. Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's screenplay, but were replaced by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for family comedies such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Freaky Friday. After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire Adam Shankman to both direct and choreograph Hairspray. Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him [...] "don't do what I did, don't <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> play did.

500|$|G. Wilson Knight, {{unlike most}} early critics, thought the poem was worthy of response, {{although}} {{he says that}} it was from [...] "the most indecent poet of high quality in our literature". Grebanier believes that Colman, as [...] "a recipient of Byron's confidence during a crucial period of the poet's life, and {{as a man who}} shared Byron's hatred of pretense... must have seen an ideal subject in presenting ruthlessly, even brutally, the basic truths about Byron's moral dilemma, as a powerful means of blasting once more that sanctimoniousness which has always been fashionable in Britain." [...] Colman's purpose was not necessarily to discuss Giraud, but to respond to those who spread rumours about Byron and criticized Byron for his failed marriage, the reason for his exile. The poem does focus on Giraud, and, as Grebanier argues, [...] "If, the poem says, our hero's affections were fastened upon Nicolo Giraud" [...] then Byron's actions are acceptable because [...] "he was but following the custom of the country. Once he had seen a beautiful Ganymede of fifteen attending the Turkish Governor, a Grecian youth, publicly known as the Governor's 'catamite.' Was it criminal to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Governor was doing?" ...|$|E

Awakening in New York City, the Minion tracks down Karen Goodleaf as Lukas arrives to America to protect her and the key. Michael Haag in his book Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's Temple to the Freemasons (2009) said, [...] "The budget for this film was $12million. A pity they did not spend a cent on research (citing that one reference was 600 years out) ...

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, saying it [...] " [...] {{the bar for}} the rest of the season" [...] and was [...] "filled to capacity with comedy." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine commented that [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "sort of like the first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote [...] "...this episode manages to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart." [...] TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed [...] "Do-Over", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to be a couple in front of Kathy. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes [...] "tend to be 30 Rocks Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx." [...] He said that the [...] "frenetic farcical plotting" [...] of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming". In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode an A- grade rating.|$|E
