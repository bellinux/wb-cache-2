The complexity of this curve stimulates the reduction of a general bistatic survey to a monostatic one, following the techniques used in seismic <b>data</b> processing.

This paper, a sequel to a recently published paper, also addresses the problem of motion compensation, in that the first survey could also be monostatic, and the location of the second monostatic survey is at choice.

Measurements were carried out in a semi-rural and suburban environment for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The COST 2100 channel model is characterized and parameterized based on clusters. The KpowerMeans algorithm and a Kalman filter are used for identifying and tracking clusters from measurements. General issues regarding the parameterization for the COST 2100 model are analyzed and the key parameters are extracted. These parameters are used as the input to the validation processes, targeting delay spread, spatial correlation, singular value distribution as well as antenna correlation. The validation results show good agreement for delay spread and channel capacity between the COST 2100 model and the measurements for the outdoor environments.

However, these Doppler-based methods are incapable of detecting blood flow in the direction normal to the ultrasound beam. An algorithm which measures the lateral blood flow velocity using speckle size change with scan velocity was developed in our previous studies. This method uses the apparent speckle size change that occurs when scatterers are moving relative to the spatial rate of A-line acquisition. Our previous {{results showed that the}} estimation error of this algorithm increases with increasing flow gradient and random scatterer movement. In this paper, the relationship between the estimation performance and flow gradient, random scatterer movement and ROI size is investigated and quantitatively assessed. Simulated blood flow data with and without flow gradient and random scatterer movement were generated by the Field II simulation program. The flow gradient is introduced by a parabolic flow profile in the simulated vessel and the random scatterer movement is generated by adding Gaussian noise to the scatterers’ position with a standard deviation as much as one tenth of the speckle cell size in each direction. Our results showed that: 1) in plug flow, estimation error decreases with increasing ROI size, with an average minimum error below 5 %. An optimal ROI size exists in both directions, which is 2. 5 axial speckle cell lengths axially and 30 lateral speckle cell widths laterally; 2) the estimation error increases up to 10 % with flow gradient; 3) an optimal lateral ROI size still exists given the presence of a flow gradient; 4) the estimation error increases with increasing axial ROI size since the correlation length shortens by the introduction of a flow gradient; 5) in addition to the previous results, when random scatterer movement is introduced into the blood flow, the average estimation error is worse by about a factor of three than <b>data</b> without random <b>scatterer</b> movement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{application}} of radar satellite <b>data</b> and Persistent <b>Scatterer</b> Interferometry (PS-InSAR) techniques {{for the detection of}} ground deformation in the semi-arid loess region of Lanzhou, northwestern China. Compared with Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), PS-InSAR overcomes the problems of temporal and geometric de-correlation and atmospheric heterogeneities by identifying persistent radar targets (PS) in a series of interferograms. The SPINUA algorithm was used to process 40 ENVISAT ASAR images for the study period 2003 – 2010. The analysis resulted in the identification of over 140000 PS in the greater Lanzhou area covering some 300 km 2. The spatial distribution of moving radar targets was checked during a field campaign and highlights the range of ground instability problems that the Lanzhou area faces as urban expansion continues to accelerate. The PS-InSAR application detected ground deformations with rates up to 10 mm a− 1; it resulted in the detection of previously unknown unstable slopes and two areas of subsidence. Lanzhou is the capital of Gansu Province {{and is one of the}} most important industrial cities in NW China (Fig. 1). The 12 th Five-Year Plan and the 2011 National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin of Lanzhou City indicate that the gross domestic product (GDP) of Lanzhou more than doubled in the last decade, reaching some 136 billion Yuan (c. £ 13. 6 billion). This is associated with a rapid increase in the urban population and current forecasts suggest that the remaining undeveloped land can sustain further development for only some 10 – 15 years (Yao 2008). Increasingly, people have to encroach on marginal areas having a greater potential for ground instability. Since 1949, a variety of geohazards (mainly comprising landslides, debris flows, soil collapse, subsidence and floods) in Lanzhou have caused some 676 deaths and an estimated cumulative direct economic loss of some 756 million Yuan (Ding & Li 2009; Dijkstra et al. 2014). It is expected that further casualties and economic impacts will result in this unstable landscape unless a better understanding of the spatial distribution and causes of typical geohazards involving ground instability can be implemented in the development of land-use management practices, urban planning and the design of mitigation strategies. Satellite-based radar interferometry provides an opportunity to map ground deformation over large areas of interest.

40|$|Ultrasound {{contrast}} {{agents have}} the ability to provide locally increased echogenicity, improving the sensitivity and specificity of images. Due to the unique interaction of microbubbles with the imaging ultrasound field, contrast ultrasonography offers both improved diagnostic techniques, and the potential therapeutic uses of gene and drug delivery through the use of targeted agents. By enhancing the contrast at the tissue-blood interface, an improved image of the structure of organs can be achieved, which is useful in many areas of medical ultrasound imaging. Monitoring the flow of contrast agent in the blood stream also offers information on the degree of blood perfusion into an organ or microvasculature. Present knowledge of the interaction of microbubbles with ultrasound is far from complete. The full potential of contrast agents in improving diagnostic and therapeutic techniques has therefore not yet been achieved. The nonlinear and dynamic properties of microbubble response offer potentially large improvements in contrast to tissue ratio, through intelligent pulse sequence design and/or improved signal processing. Due to various drawbacks of populations studies, only by studying the response from single microbubbles can the interaction be fully understood. The variations of microbubble size and shell parameters within a typical sample of contrast agent dictate {{that a large number of}} single <b>scatterer</b> <b>data</b> are necessary to obtain information on the variability of microbubble response, which is not possible with current optical systems. This thesis aims to be a contribution to the understanding of contrast behaviour in response to medical imaging ultrasound pulses. A fully characterized microacoustic system, employing a wide-band piezoelectric transducer from a commercial ultrasound imaging system, is introduced, which enables the measurement of single scattering events. Single microbubble signals from two commercially available contrast agents, Definity R and biSphereTM, have been measured experimentally in response to a range of clinically relevant imaging parameters. The data has been analyzed, together with the results from appropriate theoretical models, in order to gain physical insight into the evolution and dynamics of microbubble signals. A theoretical model for the lipid shelled agent Definity has been developed, and the predicted response from a real sample of single microbubbles investigated. Various characteristics of resonant scatter have been identified, and used to distinguish resonant scatter in experimental acoustic single bubble data for the first time. A clear distinction between the populations of resonant and off-resonant scatter has been observed for a range of incident frequencies and acoustic pressures. Results from consecutive imaging pulses have been used to gain understanding of how initial size, shell material and encapsulated gas may effect the lifetime of a microbubble signal. The response to a basic pulse sequence is also investigated, and an alternative processing method which takes advantage of observed behaviour is presented. Improved understanding of the contrast-ultrasound interaction will provide the basis for improved signal processing tools for contrast enhanced imaging, with potential benefits to both diagnostic techniques and microbubble manufacture.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the impact and {{benefits}} of high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) <b>data</b> for persistent <b>scatterer</b> interferometry (PSI) is investigated. The data is obtained by the German remote sensing satellite TerraSAR-X. From the high resolution compared to available SAR satellites so far - like ERS or ENVISAT - a large increase in numbers of persistent scatterers (PS) is expected. Therefore, the influence of different acquisition parameters on the appearance of PS is investigated in order to analyze the opportunistic character of these points. It is shown that the geometrical configuration of the sensor {{with respect to the}} objects on ground has to be considered prior to the ordering of data, as the local PS densities vary between 40, 000 and 100, 000 PS/sqkm in the analyzed areas. The different parameters are discussed in order to help with the choice of assumed best configuration, depending on the goal and demands of deformation monitoring for the area of interest. Several deformation phenomena on single buildings within two test sites of Berlin and Munich, Germany, are presented and discussed. The benefits for single object observation due to the high density of PS is demonstrated and the high precision of linear as well as periodic displacement is revealed. The availability of several stacks of the same area allows for an interpretation of motion directions with respect to horizontal as well as vertical directions. Very interesting seasonal patterns are discovered at Berlin central train station and the origin of the motion is shown to be related to thermal expansion of the steel construction. Ground truth inspections reveal special constructional devices that enable non-destructive motion at the magnitudes of the observed deformation. Furthermore, the localization precision of point scatterers is investigated by a comparison of theoretical accuracies with real data results of PSI. The regular patterns of PS on facades of modern buildings are used to derive the standard deviations of PS positions, which fit the theoretical assumptions of 2 cm in range, 4 cm in azimuth and 60 - 140 cm in elevation. By reason of the limited variation of orbital positions the location in elevation direction is available only at a precision by a factor of 20 - 30 worse than for azimuth or range direction. This is confirmed by the evaluation of PS at several facades of buildings. Based on the precise 3 D localization of PS, a new methodology for a fusion of independently geocoded PS point clouds obtained from stacks of high resolution SAR data is presented. The goal of this approach is a representation of the mapped objects by preferably completed 3 D point clouds. It is suitable for a combination of stacks of arbitrary track directions, i. e., especially the gain in information of fusing ascending and descending stacks is accomplished. The unknown relative height offsets of the reference points are solved without the usage of any reference data within the area. The algorithm is based on a least-squares adjustment of selected pairs of PS assumed (but not necessarily) to be identical. After the fusion the majority of buildings are covered by PS on all sides. Hence, single object observation is feasible. The combination of stacks of opposite viewing directions additionally allows for a calculation of motion components in vertical and horizontal directions. A straightforward algorithm is presented and results are provided for one of the test sites. The findings of the initial interpretation of motion directions by a visual comparison of PSI results of different stacks are confirmed and further examples of seasonal displacement in urban areas are provided...|$|R
