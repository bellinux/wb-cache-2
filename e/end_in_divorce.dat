25|$|The role {{of gender}} in interracial divorce dynamics, found {{in social studies}} by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King, was {{highlighted}} when examining marital instability among Black/White unions. White wife/Black husband marriages show twice the divorce rate of White wife/White husband couples by the 10th year of marriage, whereas Black wife/White husband marriages are 44% less likely to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>divorce</b> than White wife/White husband couples over the same period.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King {{conducted}} {{on behalf of}} the Education Resources Information Center examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s. The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males relative to White/White couples. White wife/Black husband marriages {{are twice as likely to}} divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples, while White wife/Asian husband marriages are 59% more likely to <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>divorce</b> compared to White/White unions. Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates. Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples. In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions. Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>divorce.</b> Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them. Our society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification. According to Daniel Forrester, [...] "e have devalued the time we spend alone just thinking, but it's that time for reflection that leads to the big ideas [...] Multitasking is espoused and almost glorified in the United States, but it is dehumanizing us and making us less creative." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was a 1.7-percent {{increase}} in Xinjiang's Uyghur population, and a 4.4-percent increase from 1940-1982 in the Hui population. Uyghur and Hui Muslims have experienced increased tension due to Hui population growth. Uyghurs in Kashgar {{remember that the}} Hui army massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs in the 1934 Battle of Kashgar, which caused tension as Hui moved into the city {{from other parts of}} China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism. Dru C. Gladney said that the Hui [...] "don't tend to get too involved in international Islamic conflict. They don't want to be branded as radical Muslims." [...] The Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. Han and Hui intermarry more than the Hui intermarry with Uyghurs, despite a common religion; according to the Uyghurs, Hui-Uyghur frequently <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>divorce.</b> The Sibe people tend to affiliate with the Han. [...] "Protect religion, kill the Han and destroy the Hui" [...] (...) was a slogan used by Uyghur separatists during the 1930s rebellions for the First East Turkestan Republic.|$|E
