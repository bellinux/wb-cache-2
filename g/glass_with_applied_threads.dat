40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for measuring radio-frequency (RF) electric field strengths with sub-wavelength resolution. We use Rydberg states of rubidium atoms {{to probe the}} RF field. The RF field causes an energy splitting of the Rydberg states via the Autler-Townes effect, and we detect the splitting via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We use this technique to measure the electric field distribution inside a <b>glass</b> cylinder <b>with</b> <b>applied</b> RF fields at 17. 04 GHz and 104. 77 GHz. We achieve a spatial resolution of ≈ 100 μm, limited by the widths of the laser beams utilized for the EIT spectroscopy. We numerically simulate the fields in the glass cylinder and find good agreement with the measured fields. Our results suggest that this technique {{could be applied to}} image fields on a small spatial scale over a large range of frequencies, up into the sub-THz regime. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{developing}} parameters and relationships for selecting a proper <b>glass</b> window <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> film as building envelopes for buildings located in a hot climate based on its thermal performances. Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the glass window is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a glass window for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 <b>glass</b> windows <b>with</b> film are investigated in this study. It can be shown that the thermal comfort index is dependent on the optical properties (total transmittance and total absorptance) and the overall heat transfer coefficient of <b>glass</b> windows <b>with</b> film. <b>Glass</b> window <b>with</b> film which has high transmittance shall have more discomfort due to solar radiation effect. <b>Glass</b> window <b>with</b> film which has high absorptance shall have more discomfort due to surface temperature effect. The discomfort from the surface temperature effect for double pane <b>glass</b> window <b>with</b> film is also dependent on the glass thickness other than the absorptance and the change in overall heat transfer coefficient. Expressions for predicting the performance of the <b>glass</b> windows <b>with</b> film in terms of thermal comfort are developed...|$|R

Conical lamps with thick wails, sometimes decorated with wheel-cut grooves. They {{are considered to}} be imported from Syro-Palestine area and Northern Italy. In Chersonessns this type of lamps was occurred in the {{deposits of}} the late IV — mid VIth cc. II. Lamp with rounded bottom, slightly flaring walls and reworked rim. They can be subdivided into 2 variants: a) lamps with rounded undecorated bottom that are originated from the deposits of the late V — 3 d quarter VII cc. and 6) lamps with more or less pointed botton <b>glass</b> or <b>with</b> <b>applied</b> blue blob. This variant was revealed in the deposits dated from the mid VI — 3 d quarter VIIth cc. III. Lamps with cylindrical or semi-spherical body, long hollow toe and reworked rim were in use in the late V — 3 d quarter VIIth cc. and were presumably produced at the local glass-making workshop. IV. The 4 th type of lamp-glasses is represented with three-handled lampe of three variants: a) with apherical body; 6) with body in the form of truncated cone and 6) with cylindrical body with narrowing on the mid-height.

40|$|Background and Aim: One of {{the most}} {{important}} structural factors that facilitate patient’s acceptance of full denture, is adequate and appropriate retention. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the retentive ability of four denture adhesives in vitro: Safe Saze-Gum Sealing-Denstet-Corega. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted in vitro on the basis of measurement of adhesion and cohesion forces between acrylic disk and <b>glass,</b> <b>with</b> denture adhesive <b>applied</b> between them. At first the retentive ability of alcohol, water and artificial saliva was measured and recorded as control. Then the retention ability of different adhesives mixed once with water and next with artificial saliva was measured and compared. The procedure was repeated 7 times for each denture adhesive with 7 similar acrylic disks. Data were analyzed using. ANOVA and paired t test with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Result: Comparison of four powder denture adhesives showed that the highest retentive ability was observed in Denstet and the lowest in Safe-Saze. The retentive ability of Gum-Sealing was higher than Corega. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, significant differences exist among the retention ability of different denture adhesives...|$|R

METHODS:This study included 132 cases(264 eyes) from January 2008 to September 2012 who were collected from our clinic. They were divided into 2 groups, full correction and under-correction.

RESULTS:There were no statistically significant differences between two groups after 6 mo(P = 0. 0693); however, there were significant differences after 12 mo(P = 0. 0013).
