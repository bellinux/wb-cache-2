25|$|Soon afterward, Călinescu, {{acting on}} {{indications}} from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defense Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of Miron Cristea, resigned in protest to Codreanu's arrest. He was a celebrity defense witness at the latter's {{first and second}} trials. During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his hand <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chișinău). Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered Antonescu's wife to be tried for bigamy, based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong. Codreanu himself {{was taken into custody}} and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} {{precedent for}} Larsen's depiction of Clare and Jack's relationship was the 1925 legal trial {{known as the}} [...] "Rhinelander Case" [...] (or Rhinelander v. Rhinelander). On the urging of his family, Leonard Kip Rhinelander, a wealthy white man, sued his wife, Alice Beatrice Jones, for annulment and fraud; he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her [...] "colored" [...] blood. The case concerned not only race but also status and class, as he had met {{her when she was}} working as a domestic. Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice (she contended that her mixed race was obvious, and she had never denied it), it came at a devastating social cost for both parties; intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court, and Alice was forced to partially disrobe <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> in the judge's chambers {{in order for them to}} assess the darkness of her skin.|$|E

Two of them testified that they heard someone being beaten, blows, and cries. One testified so quietly the judge ordered him several times to speak louder; he said he heard the victim call out, [...] "Mama, Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy." [...] Judge Curtis Swango allowed Carolyn Bryant to testify, but not <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> after the prosecution objected that her testimony was irrelevant to Till's abduction and murder. It may have been leaked in any case to the jury. Sheriff Strider testified for the defense his theory that Till was alive, and that the body retrieved from the river was white. A doctor from Greenwood stated on the stand that the body was too decomposed to identify, and therefore {{had been in the}} water too long for it to be Till.|$|E
