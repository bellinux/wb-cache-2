40|$|OBJECTIVES: Fertility rates after ectopic {{pregnancy}} (EP) were compared between the Auvergne region (central France) and the Lille region (northern France) {{in order to}} determine whether <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> are similar. We also wanted to determine whether regional differences persist if known <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> are taken into account. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the Auvergne EP register 1992 - 1998 (1. 285 women, among whom 552 tried to become pregnant again) and from Lille register 1994 - 1997 (678 women, among whom 343 tried to become pregnant again) were analyzed. Fertility was characterized by the time to a new pregnancy and its outcome (EP recurrence, intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)). Censored data methodology was used. RESULTS: Despite differences in general fertility characteristics between regions, <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> were the same with similar relative risks for age, history of infertility, previous tubal damage, use of an intrauterine device at the time of EP and EP treatment. When these factors were taken into account, fertility rate after EP remained significantly better in Auvergne than in the Lille region. CONCLUSION: This common analysis of data from two registers confirms, from a quantitative point of view, the role of the main <b>factors</b> associated with <b>fertility</b> after EP. However, other factors such as EP management or the surgical technique may intervene...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and precise in vitro technique for detecting DNA strand discontinuities produced in vivo has been developed. The procedure, {{a form of}} runoff DNA synthesis on molecules released from lysed bacterial cells, mapped precisely the position of cleavage of the plasmid pMV 158 leading strand origin in Streptococcus pneumoniae and the site of strand scission, nic, at the transfer origins of F and the F-like plasmid R 1 in Escherichia coli. When high frequency of recombination strains of E. coli were examined, DNA strand discontinuities at the nic positions of the chromosomally integrated <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> were also observed. Detection of DNA strand scission at the nic position of F DNA in the high frequency of recombination strains, {{as well as in}} the episomal factors, was dependent on sexual expression from the transmissable element, but was independent of mating. These results imply that not only the transfer origins of extrachromosomal F and F-like <b>fertility</b> <b>factors,</b> but also the origins of stably integrated copies of these plasmids, are subject to an equilibrium of cleavage and ligation in vivo in the absence of DNA transfer...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Fertility</b> <b>Factor</b> (also {{known as}} F Factor) is a {{bacterial}} DNA sequence {{that allows a}} bacterium to produce a sex pilus necessary for conjugation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{identity and}} function of the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> have long eluded researchers. Although the D. melanogaster genome sequence was recently completed, the <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> still were not identified, {{in part because of}} low cloning efficiency of heterochromatic Y sequences. Here we report a method for iterative blast searching to assemble heterochromatic genes from shotgun assemblies, and we successfully identify kl- 2 and kl- 3 as 1 β- and γ-dynein heavy chains, respectively. Our conclusions are supported by formal genetics with X-Y translocation lines. Reverse transcription–PCR was successful in linking together unmapped sequence fragments from the whole-genome shotgun assembly, although some sequences were missing altogether from the shotgun effort and had to be generated de novo. We also found a previously undescribed Y gene, polycystine-related (PRY). The closest paralogs of kl- 2, kl- 3, and PRY (and also of kl- 5) are autosomal and not X-linked, suggesting that the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome has been driven by an accumulation of male-related genes arising de novo from the autosomes...|$|R

40|$|The Y {{chromosome}} of Drosophila melanogaster has {{two types}} of loci. The first type of locus consists of single copy genes known as <b>fertility</b> <b>factors.</b> These are required only for sperm development. A P element mutagenesis screen was conducted to locate these factors. TEM reveals that P elements inserted into <b>fertility</b> <b>factors</b> give the same ultra structure phenotypes as deficiencies of the region. In addition, two new Y chromosome lines were isolated that have enhancer trap expression in testes. The second type of locus is repetitive. I conducted a screen of heterochromatic elements on the Y chromosome. This screen revealed repetitive loci that act as developmental modifiers. This was investigated using fusion proteins inserted in P elements. This study revealed that these repetitive loci are not unique to the Y chromosome and act in both the germline and soma as developmental buffers. The repetitive loci act to modulate the expression of genes. Manipulations of the Y chromosome to alter {{the amount of the}} repetitive loci present in a given fly suggest that when the balance of these repetitive loci is disturbed, developmental instability results. Investigations of loci on the Y, X and autosomes in different backgrounds suggests that there is substantially more variation in these elements in the X and autosomes than the Y. This is consistent with the selective sweep hypothesis of Drosophila Y chromosome evolution. ...|$|R
