500|$|The [...] high incline elevators, which move at [...] {{per minute}} (making an entire trip between the {{mezzanine}} levels {{in less than}} two minutes) and are sloped at a 27-degree angle, are the first of their kind in the system. Each elevator can hold up to 15 standing passengers or five wheelchair passengers. The inclined elevators were less expensive than vertically-traveling elevators, and were installed within the large escalator shaft at 34th Street. However, as the incline elevators had originally failed a <b>factory</b> <b>test</b> by its manufacturer Maspero Elevatori, there were multiple delays in opening the station, and the opening date was eventually delayed from December 2013 to late 2014, then to mid-2015.|$|E
500|$|Then, in May 2014, {{the opening}} was delayed again {{to install the}} {{inclined}} elevators, as they had originally failed a <b>factory</b> <b>test</b> in Como Province, Italy. Officials had insisted that the Italian-manufactured elevators had software and parts made {{from a variety of}} different companies in America, rather than from a single foreign company. However, the station was not delayed solely because of the elevators. The station's opening was also pushed to later dates due to [...] "integrated testing for fire protection", which required the completion of all station infrastructure, including escalators, stairs, and elevators. Escalators and tunnel ventilation systems also caused the station to be delayed. At this point, the station was expected to open for service in late 2014, but due to further elevator delays as well as problems with the extension's ventilation systems, it was delayed in October 2014 by a further few months, to February 2015.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to his rival Enzo Ferrari, Ferruccio Lamborghini had decided early on {{that there would be}} no factory-supported racing of Lamborghinis, viewing motorsport as too expensive and too draining on company resources. This was unusual for the time, as many sports car manufacturers sought to demonstrate the speed, reliability, and technical superiority through motorsport participation. Enzo Ferrari in particular was known for considering his road car business mostly a source of funding for his participation in motor racing. Ferruccio's policy led to tensions between him and his engineers, many of whom were racing enthusiasts; some had previously worked at Ferrari. When Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace began dedicating their spare time to the development of the P400 prototype, they designed it to be a road car with racing potential, one that could win on the track and also be driven on the road by enthusiasts. When Ferruccio discovered the project, he allowed them to go ahead, seeing it as a potential marketing device for the company, while insisting that it would not be raced. The P400 went on to become the Miura. The closest the company came to building a true race car under Lamborghini's supervision were a few highly modified prototypes, including those built by <b>factory</b> <b>test</b> driver Bob Wallace, such as the Miura SV-based [...] "Jota" [...] and the Jarama S-based [...] "Bob Wallace Special".|$|E
