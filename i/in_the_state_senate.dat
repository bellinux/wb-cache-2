The pro-Relief majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Senate</b> subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's {{defiance}} of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City. Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Senate,</b> Thomas F. Grady. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, {{as well as}} bills passed {{as a result of}} their deal making. The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.|$|E

No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E
