500|$|Entertainment Weekly Abby West {{wrote that}} [...] "Rory's crooning take" [...] of [...] "Blue Christmas" [...] was [...] "smooth and lovely", {{and gave it}} a [...] "B+", and Flandez agreed with the in-show {{assessment}} that it was [...] "mournfully beautiful". Futterman said that the song [...] "perfectly suits his vocals", but was unimpressed with Rory [...] "standing awkwardly" [...] through the song; Michael Slezak of TVLine noted the static staging and filming of the number {{and gave it a}} [...] "C", and while Chaney said he sang it [...] "just fine", she said he [...] "didn't sell it", and gave it a [...] "C+". Rachel's rendition of [...] "River" [...] also received divergent assessments. Chaney and Slezak both gave it an [...] "A−": the former remarked that she [...] "knows how to make the emotion in a song soar", and the latter said [...] "damn if she didn't sound amazing", though he pointed out the incongruity of Rachel having just stated after Rory's song that uptempo and jolly <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> only to sing this song, which is anything but. VanDerWerff agreed that there was [...] "no good reason for Rachel to sing it", and Flandez called it a [...] "forgettable version". Futterman's conclusion was that [...] "it feels a little phoned in and doesn't emotionally connect".|$|E

Then, in course, there is {{the general direction of the}} valleys, and of any little streams. All of these are things one goes by at first, but it gets to come natural, what they call by instinct; one knows, somehow, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> without looking for signs. You will get to it in time, if you are long enough on the plains; but at present you watch the forms of all the bushes and the lay of the grass, 'cause you see in hunting we might get separated, and you might miss your way. If you should do so, and ain't sure of your direction, fire your gun three times, as quick as you can load it, and if we are in hearing we will fire a gun in reply and come to you; but you will soon get to know the signs of the country if you will pay attention and keep your eyes skinned." ...|$|E
