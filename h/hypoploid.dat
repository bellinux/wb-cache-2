40|$|Plants <b>hypoploid</b> for {{specific}} segments {{of each of}} the maize (Zea mays L.) chromosomes were generated using 24 different B-A translocations. Plants carrying each of the B-A translocations were crossed as male parents to inbreds, and sibling progeny <b>hypoploid</b> or not <b>hypoploid</b> {{for specific}} chromosomal segments were recovered. Genomic DNAs from the parents, <b>hypoploid</b> progeny, and nonhypoploid (euploid or hyperploid) progeny for each of these B-A translocations were digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed in agarose gels, blotted onto reusable nylon membranes, and probed with nick-translated, cloned DNA fragments which had been mapped previously by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to the chromosome involved in the B-A translocation. The chromosomal segment on our RFLP map which was uncovered by each of the - B-A translocations was determined. This work unequivocally identified the short and long arms of each chromosome on this map, and it also identified the region on each chromosome which contains the centromere. Because the breakpoints of the B-A translocations were previously known on the cytological and the conventional genetic maps, this study also allowed this RFLP map to be more highly correlated with these maps...|$|E

40|$|The {{centromere}} of chromosomes 1, 6 and 9 {{are physically}} mapped by the <b>hypoploids</b> {{of the six}} most proximal B-A translocations. The <b>hypoploids</b> are deficient for a paternal chromosome arm and, as a result, lose the paternal signal of those RFLP markers located on the missing chromosome arm. Of those markers missing from the <b>hypoploids,</b> the two most proximal ones on each arm of a chromosome define the physical location of the centromere. Analysis of 10 RFLP markers on chromosome 1, 8 on chromosome 6 and 12 on chromosome 9, maps the first centromere to the umc 67 -umc 177 a region, the sixth centromere to the bnl 6. 29 -bnl 7. 28 region, and the ninth centromere to the bnl 5. 10 -umc 20 region, an interval of about 3. 3, 3 and 0. 5 map units, respectively.

40|$|Evolution of {{heterochromatic}} {{regions in}} the B long arm was studied in two directions: construction of a phylogenetic tree from mutational variants of CL-repeat {{and analysis of the}} XbaI fragments carrying CL-repeat and the repeat structural variants. Using tertiary trisomes and <b>hypoploids</b> of a set of B- 10 L translocations, the fragments associated with CL-repeat and the variants {{in each of the three}} distal heterochromatic (DH) regions were identified. Twenty fragments comprising the CL-repeat were observed in the B-chromosome, and each was assigned to an individual DH region. Four deletions, one insertion, and a large number of mutational variants from each of the three DH regions were isolated and sequenced. The sequences of 27 mutational variants were used to establish a phylogenetic tree which divided the 27 variants into three groups, each of which was associated with a distinct DH region and elucidated an evolution order of the three DH regions. According to the tree, the DH 2 was the earliest DH region, which gave rise to the DH 3 to be followed by the DH 1. The distributions of the fragments including CL-repeat and structural variants in the three DH regions were consistent with such evolution order...|$|R
40|$|The B-chromosome {{of maize}} {{contains}} an A-chromosome centromere-specific satellite CentC repeat in its centromere region (CENB) and at multiple locations in its distal heterochromatic regions (BDHs). Because CentC is highly repetitive, it {{is a challenge}} to study CentC sequences within individual centromeres or chromosome regions. The combined structure of CentC and a BDH-specific CL-repeat has allowed us to isolate CentC sequences from BDHs. In the study described herein, we have used a PCR method to amplify 13 CL-CentC variant products that were specifically mapped to A-centromeres (CENAs), the CENB, and BDHs via the tertiary trisomes and <b>hypoploids</b> of five B- 10 L translocations. Cloning and sequence analyses of these CL-CentC products have revealed a local CentC homogenization within the three CentC-containing regions. Phylogenetic analysis has indicated that the CentC sequences of BDHs are more closely related to those of CENAs in comparison to that of the CENB. Furthermore, the CentC monomers that are within the CENB are more diverse than those within BDHs and CENAs. These results shed light on the evolution of CentC repeats on the B-chromosome and provide a better understanding of B-chromosome evolution...|$|R
40|$|Four DNA {{fragments}} were amplified specifically {{from the}} B chromosome by PCR using random 10 -base oligonucleotides as primers. The {{location of the}} fragments in the B chromosome was determined based {{on whether or not}} they were amplified from the <b>hypoploid</b> DNA generated by four B-A translocations, three of which break in the proximal euchromatic region and the fourth in the distal one-third of the heterochromatic region on the B long arm. Since the <b>hypoploid</b> DNA carries the portion of the B chromosome distal to the breakpoint of a translocation, the presence of a fragment in the <b>hypoploid</b> DNA, but not in the control (which is devoid of any B chromatin), indicates that the fragments is located in the B region distal to the breakpoint in the B long arm. Two fragments were mapped to the euchromatic region and two others to either the distal portion of the euchromatic region or the proximal two-thirds of the heterochromatic region. These fragments in turn mapped three B-A translocations whose breakpoints were located in the euchromatic region. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{centromere}} of chromosome 6 {{was physically}} mapped by hypoploids of TB- 6 Lc and TB- 6 Sa generated by maize B-A translocations. The <b>hypoploid</b> from TB- 6 Lc is deficient for {{almost the entire}} length of the paternal long arm, while the <b>hypoploid</b> TB- 6 Sa is deficient for the paternal short arm. RFLP markers located on the long arm will lose the paternal signal on <b>hypoploid</b> from TB- 6 Lc, and those RFLP markers located on short arm will not possess the paternal signal on <b>hypoploid</b> from TB- 6 Sa. Then the map position of the centromere is located between two RFLP markers close to the translocation breakpoints on both arms. The result of this study maps the centromere of chromosome 6 in the bnl 6. 29 -bnl 7. 28 region, an interval of about 2 to 3 cM. The position of traslocation breakpoint was also defined, TB- 6 Lc in the csu 71 -bnl 7. 28 region, TB- 6 Sa in the uaz 102 -bnl 6. 29 region. In addition to centromeric location other interesting observations were found in this study. The hypoploids of TB- 6 Lc and TB- 6 Sa werefound to be associated with the chromosome rearrangement near or at the translocation breakpoint. The other observation is that the RFLP marker bnl 7. 28 shows homology with the B chromosome. 摘要 本論文利用玉米 B-A 易位染色體 TB- 6 Lc 和 TB- 6 Sa 所產生的亞倍體，標定第六對染色體中節位置。TB- 6 Lc 亞倍體 幾乎缺失父本染色體整個長臂，而 TB- 6 Sa 缺失同一染色體的短臂。一個 RFLP 標誌的父本訊號如果不出現在 TB- 6 Lc 亞倍體 DNA 上，表示它位於長臂上。同理，標誌的父本訊號如果不顯現在 TB- 6 Sa 亞倍體 DNA 上，它就 應位於短臂上。中節的位置座落在最靠近這兩個易位染色體斷裂點的外側標誌間。本論文結果確定第六對染色體 中節位於 RFLP 標誌 bnl 6. 29 和 bnl 7. 28 之間，區域大小約為 2 至 3 cM。本結果也顯示 TB- 6 Lc 亞倍體的斷裂點位於 csu 71 和 bnl 7. 28 之間，TB- 6 Sa 的的斷裂點在 uaz 102 和 bnl 6. 29 之間。 除了中節的標定外，本研究發現了兩個有趣的現象；其一就是亞倍體在長臂和短臂斷裂點附近有染色體重排的 情形。另一是 RFLP 標誌 bnl 7. 28 與 B 染色體具同源性。目錄 中文摘要 [...] 1 英文摘要 [...] 2 壹、引言 [...] 3 貳、前人研究 [...] . 5 一、染色體中節 [...] . 5 二、玉米的 B 染色體與 B-A 易位染色體 [...] 12 三、RFLP 標誌、圖譜及應用 [...] . 16 參、材料與方法 [...] . 20 一、遺傳材料 [...] . 20 二、 RFLP 標誌 [...] 23 三、 南方雜合分析 [...] . 26 肆、結果 [...] . 29 一、親本間多形性限制酵素的分析 [...] 29 二、第六對染色體中節之分析 [...] . 29 伍、討掄 [...] 35 參考文獻 [...] 42 圖表 [...] . 61 附錄 [...] . 7...|$|E
40|$|An {{excess of}} <b>hypoploid</b> cells has {{repeatedly}} {{been reported in}} studies of aneuploidy and has often been attributed to technical artifact. We have examined at least 200 anaphase or early-telophase cells from each of 28 normal women and found that chromosome or chromatid lagging occurs in an average of 2. 43 % of cells. In a separate study, we have examined the frequency of micronuclei in cytochalasin B-arrested, binucleate cells and shown that a similar frequency of cells (1. 6 %) contain one or more micronuclei. Using in situ hybridization of an alpha centromeric probe (alpha R 1), which hybridizes to 9 of the 22 human autosomes, {{we were able to}} infer that most, if not all, of the micronuclei contain whole chromosomes or chromatids. Since the loss of a chromosome by lagging will induce <b>hypoploid</b> daughter nuclei (two where a chromosome is lost and one where a chromatid is lost), we conclude that lagging is a major mechanism for chromosome loss in human lymphocyte cultures.

40|$|The maize B {{chromosome}} {{has been}} identified for nearly a century, but its evolutionis still elusive. The B chromosome arises not {{as a product of}} natural selection; therefore itis an ideal material for studying chromosome evolution. The objective of this proposal isto {{gain a better understanding of}} the B evolution. This goal will be achieved in twodirections: heterochromatic and euchromatic approaches. A previously identifiedCL-repeat will be used to study the evolution of heterochromatin on the B long arm. TheCL-repeat is repetitive and specific to three distal heterochromatic (DH) regions locatedin the B long arm. Thus, its mutational variants uncovered from each DH region—usingtertiary trisomes and <b>hypoploids</b> of five B- 10 L translocations—would provide salientinformation for conducting a phylogenetic analysis to elucidate the evolution path of thethree DH regions, which will be substantiated by results of the structure variant andSouthern fragment analysis. On the other hand, we will use the cDNA-amplifiedfragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique to isolate cDNA from theeuchromatic regions of the B chromosome. Characterization of these B-cDNAs will beexploited for the possible implication on its evolution. The information garnered from thetwo regions will eventually shed light on the origin of the B chromosome which, in turn,may be conducive to understanding of chromosome evolution in general. 玉米B 染色體被發現已經將近一世紀，但是對其演化過程依然了解有限。B 染色體的產生沒有經過自然的篩選，因此是一個研究染色體演化的理想材料。本計畫之目的為，對B 染色體之演化有更多的了解。為了達成此目的，分別從異染色質區與常染色質區兩個方向來進行。首先，將利用先前發現的CL-repeat 研究異染色質區的演化。CL-repeat 是重複性序列且專一存在於B 染色體長臂的三個異染色質區上，因此利用五個B- 10 L 易位染色體所產生的三級三染體及亞倍體，可以從個別的異染色質區分離出CL-repeat 的突變序列，將這些序列進行同源演化分析，可以藉此推論出三個異染色質區的演化過程；此演化過程也預期能由CL-repeat 的構造變異及Southern 片段獲得驗證。另一方面，本計劃將利用cDNA-AFLP 技術分離玉米B 染色體常染色質區上的cDNA 序列，藉由分析這些B 染色體的cDNA，可以了解B 染色體常染色質區的可能演化。本研究計劃的結果最終可以解釋玉米B 染色體的來源，也可以幫助我們了解一般染色體的演化...|$|R

These processes are preceded by rapid Bcl- 2 -independent mitochondrial transmembrane depolarization and a drop in cytoplasmic pH. Pre-incubation of cells with inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, such as cyclosporin A or bongkrekic acid, does not protect cells from mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) decrease. However, monitoring of mitochondrial entrapped calcein by confocal fluorescence imaging gives clear evidence of HY photo-induced mitochondrial permeability. This should be considered {{as the result of a}} non-specific alteration of mitochondrial membrane integrity brought about by lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, synthesis of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 appears to delay the subsequent time course of PS exposure and to reduce caspase- 3 activation and the fraction of cells which become <b>hypoploid.</b> We interpret this partially protective effect as the consequence of a direct interaction of Bcl- 2 with cytosolic cytochrome c previously released from mitochondria upon Δψm decrease and/or of Bcl- 2 inhibition of the deleterious retro-effect of caspase- 3 on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and/or the mitochondrial membrane components...|$|E

40|$|Of seven {{dominant}} knotted-leaf mutants tested, six mapped {{at or near}} Kn 1 on {{the long}} arm of chromosome 1, and one was not linked to Kn 1. Comparisons of phenotypes among these mutants allowed us {{to focus on a}} systematic abnormality: the parenchyma cells associated with lateral veins do not fully differentiate into bundle sheath, mesophyll or upper sclerenchyma. The more dramatic expression of Kn 1 mutants—knots, ligule alterations and twisting—is sporadic and dependent on the time when the mutant acts in leaf primordium development. Using lw to mark leaf sectors that lose Kn 1 following X-irradiation, we show that the knotted-leaf phenotype encoded by chromosome 1 L is autonomous. Analysis of sectors lacking a particular Kn 1 gene (Kn 1 -N 2) suggests that Kn 1 itself, rather than a linked modifier gene, is autonomous in the leaf primordium. Aneuploid studies using various translocations involving 1 L and marked by Adh 1 allozymes are compared. The Kn 1 mutant appears to encode a "new" function or a considerable overproduction of an extant product in the leaf. Kn 1 /- 1 L <b>hypoploids</b> either express knotted poorly or not at all; transvection is ruled out, but the cause for this modification of Kn 1 expression is not yet known. —Our working hypothesis is that Kn 1 mutants permit the expression of a product that is usually not produced in leaf primordial cells.

40|$|Three {{dominant}} mutant alleles of the Polycomb {{locus of}} Drosophila melanogaster {{are associated with}} homoeotic transformations of meso- and metathoracic to prothoracic legs, a homoeotic transformation of antennae to legs, and abnormalities of wings and some thoracic bristles. Puro and Nygrén (1975) localized Polycomb in the proximal left arm of chromosome 3 within salivary gland chromosome interval 77 E,F- 80. In the present study, the location and dosage relationships of this locus were examined, using translocation-generated segmental aneuploidy. The results indicate that Polycomb lies within interval 78 C,D- 79 D, and that the locus is haplo-insufficient. Males <b>hypoploid</b> for this interval show meso- and metathoracic leg transformations, and {{both males and females}} show wing abnormalities.

It is suggested that the expression of non-homoeotic pleiotropic effects provides a criterion for identifying homoeotic mutations that do not function directly in the establishment of determined states, but rather cause homoeosis indirectly.

In the present investigation, this genetic behavior is shown to be a concomitant of region 83 D-E itself, and independent of the particular Y-autosome translocations utilized to generate aneuploid classes. Newly induced chromosomal duplications including 83 D-E are recovered by their ability to complement the corresponding deficiency; these aberrations indicate that the phenomenon depends on genetic dosage per se and is independent of linkage relationships. Further tests involving the generation of large numbers of aneuploid zygotes support the conclusion that these individuals very rarely and possibly never survive to the adult stage.

This phenomenon was significantly more frequent in SS (P < 0. 04) than in control diseases. The redistribution of plasma membrane PS preceded other events associated with apoptosis: hypoploidy, DNA fragmentation, and morphology characteristic for apoptosis. Apoptosis-inducing AECA did not recognize the Fas receptor. We conclude that AECA may be pathogenic by inducing apoptosis...|$|E

To address the issue of whether activation is a prerequisite for AECA-mediated apoptosis of EC, 23 AECA-positive sera were evaluated for their ability to induce activation and/or apoptosis. Activation was defined as an over-expression of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Optical microscopy, annexin V binding, <b>hypoploid</b> cell enumeration, and determination of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage-related products were used to assess apoptosis. Four functional profiles were defined: 10 sera promoted activation and apoptosis (act+/apo+), one was act+/apo-, six act-/apo+, and the remaining six act-/apo-. The reduced membrane expression of thrombomodulin was associated with apoptosis, rather than activation. Caspase- 3 was implicated in the two models of apoptosis, the ratios of several survival proteins to Bax decreased, regardless of the ability of apo+ AECA to activate the cells, while radical oxygen species {{did not appear to be}} involved. Furthermore, it occurred that macrophages engulfed EC treated with apoptosis-promoting AECA, but not those incubated with AECA that did not induce apoptosis. Hence, AECA represent an extremely heterogeneous family of autoantibodies, not only because of the variety of their target antigens, but also the subsequent diversity of their effects...|$|E
40|$|Background. Armillaridin (AM) is {{isolated}} from Armillaria mellea. We examined the anticancer activity and radiosensitizing effect on human esophageal cancer cells. Methods. Human {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (CE 81 T/VGH and TE- 2) and adenocarcinoma (BE- 3 and SKGT- 4) cell lines were cultured. The MTT assay was used for cell viability. The cell cycle was analyzed using propidium iodide staining. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by DiOC 6 (3) staining. The colony formation assay was performed for estimation of the radiation surviving fraction. Human CE 81 T/VGH xenografts were established for evaluation of therapeutic activity in vivo. Results. AM inhibited the viability of four human esophageal cancer cell lines with an estimated concentration of 50 % inhibition (IC 50) which was 3. 4 – 6. 9 [*]μM. AM induced a <b>hypoploid</b> cell population and morphological alterations typical of apoptosis in cells.

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of these compounds on human pancreatic cancer cells. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC- 1 and BxPC- 3 were used to perform an MTT assay for cell viability and Liu’s stain for morphological observation. The cell cycle was analyzed by DNA histogram. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was used as a marker for cancer stem cells (CSC). Western blotting was performed for the expression of proteins related to CSC signaling. The results showed that compounds 6 -MITC and I 7557, but not I 7447, inhibited viability of both PANC- 1 and BxPC- 3 cells. Morphological observation showed mitotic arrest and apoptosis in 6 -MITC- and I 7557 -treated cells. These two compounds induced G 2 /M phase arrest and <b>hypoploid</b> population.

MKs were subsequently identified by immunofluorescent techniques using two monoclonal antiplatelet antibodies (AN 51 and J 15). The maturation process was studied by ultrastructural methods. A marked {{increase in the number}} of circulating CFU-MK was observed in all the 10 cases studied prior to chemotherapy (70 -fold increase per ml of blood). No significant modification in the regulation of MK colony formation as compared to that of normal subjects was observed. The predominant abnormality in maturation in culture was the occurrence of many <b>hypoploid</b> MKs (microMKs). However, the cytoplasmic maturation of the MKs was identical to that of normal subjects with occasional platelet shedding. Since microMKs predominated in some patients, scoring of MK colonies in CML necessitated immunofluorescent labelling to permit identification of MKs. During the blast crisis, MK colony formation occurred in four out of five patients with an extremely high plating efficiency in the case of promegakaryoblastic transformation. In contrast, MK colonies could not be grown from blood samples of patients with acute leukaemia, including two cases of promegakaryoblastic leukaemia. Maturation of MKs in blast crisis was identical to that of the chronic phase. Furthermore, after short periods of culture in liquid medium, circulating promegakaryoblasts from patients in blast crisis matured with the consequent production of alpha-granules and demarcation membranes. These results confirm the contention that CML represents a pluripotent stem-cell disease, involving the MK lineage, and suggest that the block in maturation during the acute phase can be overcome in vitro...|$|E

The proliferative activity in parathyroid tumours as detected by DI and AgNOR counts was evaluated in all specimens. Both DI (1. 37 +/- 0. 33 vs 1. 0 +/- 0. 1) and AgNOR (3. 01 +/- 0. 31 vs 1. 54 +/- 0. 35) counts were higher (P 1) and <b>hypoploid</b> (DI < 1) neoplasms were found in 11 (PC = 4, PA = 7), 14 (PC = 11, PA = 3) and five (PC = 0, PA = 5) patients respectively. The average postoperative survival in patients with PC was 46. 9 +/- 37. 4 months (range 21 - 146 months). The survivals of patients with aneuploid (n = 11) and diploid (n = 4) PC were 74. 0 +/- 58. 1 and 34. 1 +/- 18. 4 months (P= 0. 21) respectively.

Our data confirmed previous reports indicating that in myeloma nearly all marrow plasma cells are abnormal (98. 7 +/- 8. 1 %). In monoclonal gammopathy the fraction of abnormal plasma cells was 35. 0 +/- 32. 8 %. In both myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy, the most frequent aberrant phenotypic features consisted of absence of expression of CD 19, strong expression of CD 56, and decreased intensity of expression of CD 38; aberrant expression of CD 10, CD 20, CD 22, or CD 28 was observed in less than one-third of myeloma cases. The vast majority of cases had two or more phenotypic aberrations. In the DNA studies, 7 % of myeloma cases were biclonal and 93 % of cases were monoclonal.

40|$|Abstract: South Africa {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{incidence}} rates of melanoma in the world. The lifetime risk of developing melanoma in South Africa is 1 in 314 men and 1 in 391 women. Patients with advanced melanoma have a very poor prognosis and many of the chemotherapies used to treat melanoma have undesirable side effects. Therefore, there is the need to identify a melanoma treatment that has minimal side effects. Medicinal plants are a valuable source of new drugs, drug leads and chemical entities and many of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs currently in clinical use have been derived from plants. Sutherlandia frutescens is a medicinal plant indigenous to South Africa which has reported anti-cancer activities. Extracts of S. frutescens have been shown to have anti-proliferative apoptosis-inducing effects in a variety of cell lines. However, its effect on melanoma cells has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an extract of S. frutescens could induce apoptosis in the A 375 melanoma cell line and to outline the basic mechanism of action. The techniques used to evaluate this aim included the alamarBlue® assay, light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, western blot analyses and real-time PCR arrays. S. frutescens extract was found to induce apoptosis in the A 375 cells as evidenced by an accumulation of <b>hypoploid</b> cells, apoptotic morphological features, phosphatidylserine translocation, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, caspase activation and the release of cytochrome c. The extract was also able to induce cell death in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, which may be mediated by the apoptosis inducing factor. Additionally, S. frutescens extract altered the expression of a number of cancer-related genes. The data presented in this study largely support the hypothesis that S. frutescens extract exerts a cytotoxic effect on melanoma cells that involves the induction of apoptosis. The extract was able to induce extrinsic and intrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis as well as caspase-independent cell death. Furthermore, gene analysis revealed several new molecular targets of S. frutescens extract. These include angiogenesis, metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transformation, hypoxia, cell cycle regulation and cell senescence. Taken together, the results of this study show that S. frutescens extract is effective in inducing apoptosis in malignant melanoma cells and indicates that further investigation into the clinical potential of the extract is warranted.

40|$|Crosses between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bulbous barleygrass (H. bulbosum) {{could be}} {{valuable}} {{for the transfer}} of such properties as resistance to cold or diseases from H. bulbosum to H. vulgare. From the literature it was known that difficulties arose in the cross: seed abortion necessitating culture of the hybrid embryo, sterility of the hybrids, and all the viable hybrids mentioned in the literature were triploid. The purpose of my study was to enlarge knowledge of these interspecific crosses, and to try and solve the difficulties. For convenience parents and hybrids were denoted by genome symbols, e. g. VV = H. vulgare (2 x), BB = H. bulbosum (2 x). The results below are arranged as in the chapters. Crossing and the hybrids All eight possible crosses between diploid and autotetraploid cytotypes of the two species were tried. The direction of the cross, the parents and environmental conditions seemed to influence its success. Both crosses between VV and BB yielded three haploid plants with the genome V and six diploid hybrids. The haploids {{and two of the}} hybrids died before flowering. The cross VV x BBBB was most successful: one haploid plant with the genome V and 145 triploid hybrids, of which 13 died before flowering. The reciprocal cross yielded 12 triploid hybrids. Both crosses between VVVV and BB were unsuccessful, whereas the two crosses between VVVV and BBBB produced 18 dihaploids with the genome VV and 16 plants with more than 14 chromosomes and hybrid characteristics. Of the dihaploids nine died before flowering and of the hybrids six (tables 2 to 6). All the hybrids resembled one another and were almost sterile (tables 7 and 8). Their general form was that of H. bulbosum, although they were not so large and vigorous. Chromosome number was usually unstable in the tetraploid hybrids; from one of them a diploid hybrid arose, presumably by gradual elimination of chromosomes, while six of the plants formed tillers, usually fertile, resembling H. vulgare. The progeny of these tillers were diploid {{with the exception of one}} which yielded diploid and tetraploid plants, presumably by spontaneous doubling up of the chromosomes. The dihaploid plants closely resembled diploid H. vulgare and were fertile. They and the haploid must have arisen by elimination of chromosomes. Later generations from dihaploids and from fertile tillers of tetraploid hybrids were compared with H. vulgare. Progeny with cytoplasm of H. vulgare (from the cross VVVV x BBBB) differed slightly from diploid H. vulgare, probably because the genetic constitution of the two sets of chromosomes derived from the tetraploid is no longer identical with that of the diploid variety of barley. Offspring of dihaploids with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum (from the cross BBBB x VVVV differed more because there would be a cytoplasmic effect as well as the genetic effect (table 9). Embryology Development of the caryopsis from the crosses VV x BB, VV x BB 13 B and VVVV x BBBB was compared with intravarietal fertilization VV x VV. All parts of the caryopsis developed slower in interspecific crosses. Seed of the crosses VV x BB and VVVV x BBBB usually aborted within two weeks of pollination before any organs of the embryo had differentiated. Seed of VV x BBBB aborted within three or four weeks after organs of the embryo had started differentiating abnormally. From early in development all interspecific crosses showed abnormalities in division of cells and nuclei in the endosperm. Besides many micronuclei, there were multinuclear cells and giant nuclei which arose by endomitosis or by nuclear fusion in the multinuclear cells followed by endomitosis. The abnormal endosperm degenerated, thus appearing to be the primary cause of seed abortion. In the hybrid embryo abnormalities were detected, from which micronuclei arose. They appeared later than in the endosperm and seemed not to be the direct cause of abortion of the embryo, even though they affect its vitality. In the hybrid crosses the antipodal cells remained intact slightly longer than in the intravarietal cross and occasionally some cells remained intact much longer, giving rise to enormous giant nuclei, perhaps by endomitosis. The maternal tissue in the hybrid crosses developed initially as in the intravarietal cross but more slowly. Seed abortion certainly curtailed this early. Cytogenetics The karyotypes of parental species, hybrids and various other progeny were described and compared, to see whether there was any change in chromosomal morphology and to find the chromosomal composition of plants after vegetative elimination of chromosomes. Amphiplasty occurred in the hybrid so that satellites of the H. bulbosum genome were not visible as such. The relative lengths of the chromosomes within a genome were not affected by hybridization and the ratio of lengths between the genomes of H. vulgare and H. bulbosum were about the same in all hybrids. The karyotypes obtained by vegetative elimination of chromosomes were entirely as expected (tables 12 to 22). The maximum number of nucleoli per cell of vegetative tissue corresponded with the number of satellite chromosomes except in some cells of triploid hybrids. The average number of nucleoli per cell was in diploids and triploids much larger and in tetraploids slightly larger than expected from the number in H. vulgare. Thus the presence of chromosomes of H. bulbosum increased the number of nucleoli per cel (table 23 and figure 26). In all types of hybrid, chromosomes paired completely or almost completely during the pachytene stage of meiosis, by which allosyndetic, non-homologous autosyndetic and homologous autosyndetic pairing occurred simultaneously. Then some associations of chromosomes fell apart by desynapsis which was a result of low chiasma frequency. The other chromosomes remained joined by chiasmata or pseudochiasmata, which could hardly be distinguished from each other. In diploid hybrids most seemed to be pseudochiasmata and they sometimes lasted until the first anaphase. In the triploids most normal chiasmata gave rise to association of chromosomes in the first metaphase, while in tetraploids both types occurred together but with fewer pseudochiasmata than normal chiasmata (tables 24, 25, 28, 29, and 31). In all types of hybrid there were one or rarely two nucleoli per cell during prophase and diakinesis of meiosis. The nucleolus was associated with two chromosomes or chromosomal configurations at most. In diploids and tetraploids and to a lesser extent in triploids there were aneuploid cells, chiefly <b>hypoploid.</b> Many cells contained various inclusions; <b>hypoploid</b> cells contained the most. The inclusions and the aneuploidy could be ascribed to abnormal premeiotic division in which not all the chromosomes were distributed between the daughter cells (tables 26 and 32). Association of chromosomes was studied in the first metaphase of aneuploid cells. In diploid hybrids, association decreased rapidly in <b>hypoploid</b> cells with declining chromosome number. In triploid hybrids this decrease was less marked and in cells with about 14 chromosomes association reached the rate found in the diploid hybrids, suggesting that it was chiefly the chromosomes of H. bulbosum which had been eliminated. In tetraploid hybrids association decreased rapidly until chromosome number reached 24 and then decreased slower slightly above the rate of association found in aneuploid cells of triploids. This indicates that there is some selectivity in the elimination of chromosomes, whereby the chromosomes of H. bulbosum stand more chance of being eliminated (figure 33). Because of univalents, pseudochiasmata and aneuploidy, meiosis was very irregular from the first metaphase. The tetrads contained micronuclei and pollen micrograins. Ripe anthers of diploid hybrids contained no stainable grains; triploids contained little stainable grains and they were of variable diameter; in tetraploids there was a proportion of stainable grains which varied between plants and grain diameter was very variable (tables 27, 30 and 34). In the haploid plant with the genome V there was a slight tendency to form bivalents in meiosis, but they mostly proved to be pseudobivalents. Dihaploids with the genome VV all had very regular meiosis similar to that of diploid H. vulgare. The pollen of these plants was identical with that of diploid H. vul gare (tables 33 and 34). Discussion Many of the abnormalities seem to be caused by faulty division of nuclei containing chromosomes from both H. vulgare and H. bulbosum. They included the abnormal development of endosperm, lack of vigour in the hybrid embryo and plant, vegetative elimination of chromosomes, and- the occurrence of aneuploid pollen mother cells. The abnormalities could be the result of incompatibility between chromosomes or genes of the parental species. The observed differences in the amount and nature of abnormalities in several tissues probably ensue from existing differences between the tissues, e. g. in speed of mitoses, and by differences in gene dosage. Another abnormality in the hybrid nucleus is amphiplasty, which was expressed as the suppression of the secondary constriction in the satellite chromosome of H. bulbosum and probably caused the suppression of nucleolus activity in the same chromosome. This abnormality is perhaps associated with the preferential elimination of the chromosomes of H. bulbosum. Finally there are abnormalities in meiosis: besides aneuploidy, there are desynapsis as a result of low chiasma frequency and formation of pseudochiasmata. The low chiasma frequency probably is genetically determined, while the pseudochiasmata might be the result of matrix connections or fusion of heterochromatin. The significance of the hybrids for barley breeding is briefly considered. As it is likely that in meiosis material is exchanged between chromosomes of the two parents and as the hybrids are not completely sterile, it may be possible to introduce characteristics of H. bulbosum into H. vulgare. In somatic tissue characteristics could be transferred by induction of interspecific translocations, for example in tetraploid hybrids, after which the preferential elimination of chromosomes could be used to recover changed genomes of H. vulgare. Perhaps hexaploid hybrids VVBBBB could be used. Plants with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum and the chromosomes of H. vulgare could be of interest for breeding frost-resistant barley and in the study of male-sterile barley. The possibilities deserve further research...|$|E
