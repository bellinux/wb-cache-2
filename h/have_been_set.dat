5|$|A box set {{entitled}} The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series {{was released}} on 3 October 2005. It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the Tertiary Phase, featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006.

5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Child labour is {{a complex}} problem that is {{basically}} rooted in poverty. The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child labour elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organisations are also involved. Special investigation cells <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the eradication of child labour was 10million in 1995–96 and 16million in 1996–97. The allocation for 2007 is 21million.|$|E
5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E

5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|The College of Design (formerly College of Architecture) {{maintains}} a small permanent presence in Paris in {{affiliation with the}} École d'architecture de Paris-La Villette and the College of Computing has a similar program with the Barcelona School of Informatics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. There are additional programs in Athlone, Ireland, Shanghai, China, and Singapore. Georgia Tech was supposed set up two campuses for research and graduate education in the cities of Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, Telangana, India by the year 2010, but it appears the plans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> on hold as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E

5|$|The last of {{the early}} operas, Vakula the Smith (Op.14), was {{composed}} {{in the second half}} of 1874. The libretto, based on Gogol's Christmas Eve, was to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> to music by Alexander Serov. With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote an opera based on the same story, Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} {{documented}} by droppings and tracks, {{pictures of the}} Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. On 24 April 2007, {{it was announced that}} cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino. The night-time footage showed the rhino eating, peering through jungle foliage, and sniffing the film equipment. The World Wildlife Fund, which took the video, has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone. Monitoring has continued; 50 new cameras <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up, and in February 2010, {{what appeared to be a}} pregnant rhino was filmed.|$|E
