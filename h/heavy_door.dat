25|$|Since its closure, {{reports of}} unexplained clanging sounds, screams, and crying {{have often been}} {{reported}} in the prison blocks. Unexplained footsteps and moaning have been reported in both A and B blocks. C-Block is reputedly haunted by the spirit of former inmate Abie Maldowitz (nicknamed Butcher) who was murdered in the laundry room. On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a <b>heavy</b> <b>door</b> swinging in C-Block, but found no cause for it; the door swinging continued on other nights.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{drawbridge}} {{was intended}} for the door, but has decayed since {{and was replaced by}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>door.</b> On the Southern side of the castle, there exists a gun stone with the coat of Avis house. The top is crowned by battlements with cruzetadas battlements, balconies with boulders, with four cylindrical watchtowers at the corners, dominating the eastern side and the south side, two maineladas Gothic windows. A fence, reinforced by seven turrets (three east, three to the west and south) of circular plan, top the exterior of the tower.|$|E
25|$|Although many real dungeons {{are simply}} a single plain {{room with a}} <b>heavy</b> <b>door</b> or with access only from a {{hatchway}} or trapdoor in {{the floor of the}} room above, the use of dungeons for torture, along with their association to common human fears of being trapped underground, have made dungeons a powerful metaphor in a variety of contexts. Dungeons, in the plural, have come to be associated with underground complexes of cells and torture chambers. As a result, the number of true dungeons in castles is often exaggerated to interest tourists. Many chambers described as dungeons or oubliettes were in fact storerooms, water-cisterns or even latrines.|$|E
