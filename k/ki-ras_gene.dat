40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM—The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine if detection of <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> point mutations in bile specimens could differentiate between benign and malignant biliary strictures.  PATIENTS—Bile specimens were obtained from 117  patients exhibiting a stricture of the main bile duct, the nature of which was assessed by cholangiography, histology, and follow up.  METHODS—DNA from frozen bile specimens was extracted, amplified, and tested for codon 12  point mutations of <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> using sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridisation and mutant allele specific amplification.  RESULTS—DNA amplification was successful in 110 / 117 bile specimens (94 %). Detection of <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in bile specimens was positive in 24. 4 % (22 / 90) of patients with malignant strictures, in 31. 4 % (22 / 70) when only primary malignant tumours were considered, and in 4 % (1 / 25) of patients with benign strictures. Of the 49  patients with histological specimens obtained before surgery, the sensitivity of histology, Ki-ras mutation analysis, and combined methods was 59. 2 %, 28. 6 %, and 73. 5 % respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—Our study showed that Ki-ras mutations may be detected in about one third of bile specimens from patients with primary tumours invading the main bile duct. Detection of such mutations appears to be specific and may help to differentiate between benign and malignant biliary strictures.    Keywords: biliary strictures; bile specimens; <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—In {{patients}} with long standing ulcerative colitis {{at risk of}} developing malignancy, mutations of the p 53 and <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> were investigated in lavage solution obtained at surveillance colonoscopy.  METHODS—DNA was isolated from 31  consecutive {{patients with}} total or subtotal ulcerative colitis and a disease duration of between seven and 26  years. Twenty seven control patients showed no macroscopic or microscopic inflammation on colonoscopy. Exons 5 - 8 of the p 53 gene and exon 1  of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Mutations of the p 53 gene were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Point mutations of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> were hybridised on dot blots with oligonucleotides marked with digoxigenin.  RESULTS—In all cases of ulcerative colitis and {{in all of the}} 27  control patients, wild type p 53 and wild type Ki-ras could be detected. In four patients with ulcerative colitis, a mutation in exon 5  to 7  of the p 53 gene was found, and two patients had a mutation of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> (Gly to Asp- 12, Gly to Val- 12). None of these patients had dysplasia in serial biopsy specimens, and all but one had had the disease for more than 10  years. One control patient had a mutation.  CONCLUSIONS—Mutations were more frequent in patients with long standing ulcerative colitis (19 %) than in control patients (3 %, p =  0. 07). The technique may be useful for screening for early malignancy in ulcerative colitis.    Keywords: p 53; K-ras; colonic lavage; ulcerative colitis; molecular screenin...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} whether genomic amplification of HER- 2 /neu or mutations of the p 53 and ras genes {{were present}} in gastrinomas. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Amplification of HER- 2 /neu, a proto-oncogene related to the epidermal growth factor receptor, and mutation of the ras proto-oncogene and p 53 tumor suppressor gene appear {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of some human cancers. Little is known about possible molecular alterations in gastrinomas, tumors that may be particularly virulent because of gastrin overproduction, resulting in the severe ulcer diathesis, the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. METHODS: The differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was used to detect amplification of the HER- 2 /neu gene in DNA samples from the novel human gastrinoma cell line (PT) and from paraffin-embedded samples of gastrinomas. Sequencing techniques were used to determine whether mutations of the p 53 or ras (Ha-ras, N-ras, <b>Ki-ras)</b> <b>genes</b> were present. RESULTS: Amplification (> twofold) occurred in all gastrinoma tumor samples. Compared with normal pancreas or ileum, a 4 - to 12 -fold amplification of HER- 2 /neu was found in 3 gastrinomas, 3 to 3. 3 -fold in four samples and 2. 1 - to 2. 4 -fold in the remaining five tumors. A heterozygous point mutation in the p 53 gene (codon 273) was found in a single sample; none of the gastrinomas contained a mutation of the ras genes. CONCLUSIONS: Amplification of the HER- 2 /neu gene, but not alterations of either p 53 or ras, may be involved in the pathogenesis of gastrinomas. The unique PT cell line will be a useful model to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to gastrinoma formation and growth...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reactive {{oxygen species}} play a {{critical}} role in inducing apoptosis. The small GTPase p 21 Ras and the ERK 1 / 2 MAPK have been proposed as key regulators of the signaling cascade triggered by oxidative stress (H 2 O 2). Harvey-Ras (Ha-Ras) and Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) isoforms are so far functionally indistinguishable, because they activate the same downstream effectors, including ERK 1 / 2. Moreover, ERK 1 / 2 signaling has been involved in both protection and induction of apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to H 2 O 2, and apoptosis was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and caspase- 3 activation. Transfection of Ha-Ras and <b>Ki-Ras</b> <b>genes</b> in HUVECs was performed to evaluate the response to H 2 O 2. We have found that, whereas Ha-Ras decreases tolerance to oxidative stress, Ki-Ras has a potent antiapoptotic activity. Both effects are mediated by ERK 1 / 2. Tolerance to H 2 O 2 is encoded by a unique stretch of lysines at the COOH terminus of the Ki-Ras, lacking in Ha-Ras, and it is relatively independent of the farnesylated anchor. Inhibition of p 21 Ras signaling by farnesylation inhibitors increased the resistance to apoptosis in Ha-Ras-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings explain the opposite effects of ERK 1 / 2 stimulation on apoptosis found in different cell types and suggest that local activation of ERK 1 / 2 signaling may account for the opposing response to oxidative stress by Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras-expressing cells. Modulation of cell reactivity to oxidative stress by p 21 Ras points to the specific and predictive effects of Ras inhibitors in vivo as potential therapeutic drugs in disorders produced by increase of reactive oxygen species inside the cell...|$|R

Statuses of LOH (at 5 q, 8 p, 17 p, 18 q, and 22 q), MSI, and CIMP (MINT 1, MINT 2, MINT 31, MLH- 1, MGMT, p 14, p 16, and RASSF 1 A) were determined using microsatellite polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction coupled with a crypt isolation method, respectively. In addition, mutations of p 53, <b>Ki-ras,</b> and APC <b>genes</b> were also examined. LOH, MSI, and CIMP status allowed us to classify samples into two groups: low or negative and high or positive. Whereas the frequency of p 53 mutations in the LOH-high status was significantly higher in left-sided cancers than in right-sided cancers, CIMP-high in the LOH-high status and MSI-positive status were more frequently found in right-sided cancers compared with left-sided cancers.

40|$|Ki-ras and p 53 {{genes are}} {{involved}} in human lung carcinogenesis; however, the role of these genes in experimental lung tumors is not well known. In our study, the CBA/J mouse strain was used to investigate the presence of Ki-ras and p 53 alterations in lung carcinogenesis of spontaneous tumors and tumors induced with high and low doses of urethane (ethyl carbamate). To study {{the presence of these}} alterations {{in the early stages of}} lung carcinogenesis and in very small lung tumors, restriction fragment length polymorphism and single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses were performed on polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from microdissected tumoral and normal lung samples. <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in codons 12 and 61 were detected in all types of lung lesions, even in small and preneoplastic lesions, and their incidence increased with progression from lung hyperplasias (18 %) to adenomas (75 %) and to carcinomas (80 %). Urethane exposure, in both high and low doses, increased the incidence of Ki-ras mutations in lung tumors, especially in adenomas. The presence of <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in very small urethane-induced lung tumors and the absence of hyperplasias among the treated-group lesions may indicate that urethane accelerates tumoral progression. No p 53 mutations were detected in exons 5 - 8 in any of the epithelium-derived lung tumors. Only one p 53 mutation in exon 5 was found in a spontaneous lymphoma.

Members of the ras <b>gene</b> family (<b>Ki-ras,</b> Ha-ras and N-ras) are structurally related and code for a protein (p 21) known to play an important role in the regulation of normal signal transduction and cell growth. The frequency of ras mutations is different from one type of tumor to another, suggesting that point mutations might be carcinogen-specific. OBJECTIVES: To study the occurrence of Ki-ras and Ha-ras mutations. We also studied the relative level of Ha-ras mRNA in 32 of the head and neck tumors. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University referral unit. PARTICIPANTS: 60 head and neck tumors and in 28 Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibromas (JNA). DIAGNOSTIC TEST: Using PCR-SSCP we examined the occurrence of Ki-ras and Ha-ras mutations. The relative level of Ha-ras mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: None of the head and neck tumors or JNA samples showed evidence of mutations within codons 12, 13, 59 and 61 of <b>Ki-ras</b> or Ha-ras <b>genes.</b> However, 17 (53 %) of the tumors where gene expression could be examined exhibited increased levels of Ha-ras mRNA compared with the normal tissue derived from the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that mutations of <b>Ki-ras</b> and Ha-ras <b>genes</b> are not associated with the development of JNA and confirm previous reports indicating that activating ras mutations are absent or rarely involved in head and neck tumors from western world patients. Furthermore, our findings suggest that overexpression of Ha-ras, rather than mutations, might be an important factor in the development and progression of head and neck tumors...|$|R
40|$|The KRAS <b>gene</b> (<b>Ki-ras</b> 2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral {{oncogene}} homolog) is an oncogene that encodes a small GTPase transductor protein called KRAS.

To further explore the genetics of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> in mouse lung tumor susceptibility, the parental origin of Ki-ras oncogenes detected in lung tumors from the F 1 hybrids was determined by a strategy based on a 37 -base-pair deletion in the second intron of the A/J Ki-ras allele. Ki-ras oncogenes were derived from the A/J parent in 38 of 40 tumors obtained from C 3 A mice and 30 of 30 tumors from AC 3 mice.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Characterization of the 5 ' {{flanking}} region of rainbow trout <b>ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> was begun with the cloning and sequencing {{of this region}} by the inverse PCR technique and dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. In total, a nucleotide sequence of 1080 bp upstream from the first coding ATG was sequenced. Although this region showed certain promoter elements, it does not share common features with other mammalian ras promoters, which lack the TATA and contain multiple GC boxes with Spl binding activities. In contrast, this region in trout ras contains typical TATA and CCAAT boxes. This structural difference of the trout ki-ras promoter from that of other mammalian ras genes may suggest that different transcriptional regulation mechanisms of the ras ger. e are used at various levels in evolution. The chromatin structure of the trout <b>ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> was studied by probing invivo for DNase I hypersensitive sites. To overcome the difficulties of using the traditional indirect end labeling method for a single-copy gene, the technique of ligation-mediated PCR was applied. No hypersensitive sites were observed {{at or near the}} codon 12 region of the gene, either in normal (protooncogene) or tumor (oncogene) tissue from the liver. This result suggests that the local chromatin structure of trout <b>ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> may not be an important factor for codon 12 mutations induced by genotoxins, and that changes of chromatin structure are unlikely to be promoted after tumor formation. Studies by micrococcal nuclease demonstrate that this ras gene, in the region around 12, lacks ordered nucleosome positioning or may be even free of nucleosomes. Such an irregular organization of ras oncogenic chromatin would resemble that of many other "normal", highly active eukaryotic genes. The intrinsic affinity of trout <b>ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> for aflatoxin B₁ was determined by in vitro alkylation experiments. Exon 1 of the gene was synthesized and labeled at the 5 'end of the coding strand by the PCR technique. Taking advantage of the selective cleavage of AFB 1 -DNA adducts by piperidine under alkali conditions, the frequency of AFB 1 attack to each guanyl site was determined by densitometric scans after the cleaved fragments were electrophoresed on sequencing gels. The results demonstrated that two guanyl sites of codon 12 had differential affinity to AFBl, the more 5 ' G was relatively inaccessible but the more 3 ' G was accessible, indicating that the sequence selectivity of AFB I may contribute to the preference of the initial adduction in vivo...|$|E

By utilizing transfection assay, Southern blot analysis, and DNA amplification techniques, we have detected an activated <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> in the DNAs of both spontaneously occurring and chemically induced lung tumors of strain A mice. The point mutations in the spontaneous lung tumors were in both codon 12 (60 %) and codon 61 (30 %).

The selectivity of mutations in the Ki-ras oncogene observed in chemically induced tumors, as compared to spontaneous tumors, suggests that these chemicals directly induce point mutations in the Ki-ras protooncogene.

Normal cells express low levels of p 21 ras encoded by cellular <b>genes</b> (<b>Ki-ras</b> and Ha-ras) homologous to the Ki and Ha murine sarcoma virus transformation genes. A bone marrow-derived mouse cell line, 416 B, has been shown to express unusually high levels of p 21 ras.

The levels in 416 B cells of the two Ki-ras RNAs, sized 5. 2 and 2. 0 kilobases, were both elevated approximately 25 -fold over levels found in normal mouse cells; there was no corresponding change in 416 B cells in the levels of the two Ha-ras RNAs. We partially purified the two Ki-ras mRNAs and separated them by velocity sedimentation in sucrose density gradients.

40|$|The <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> is {{frequently}} mutated and/or overexpressed in human cancer. Since it is suspected {{to play a}} key role in the pathogenesis of many tumors, there is interest to search for strategies aiming at the specific inhibition of this oncogene. In this paper, we investigated the capacity of a 20 mer G-rich oligonucleotide (ODN 20) conjugated to high molecular weight monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG) to inhibit the expression of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> and the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. The conjugate, MPEG ODN 20, was designed to form a triplex with a critical pur/pyr sequence located in the promoter of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene.</b> To make the conjugate resistant to endogenous and exogenous nucleases, five phosphorothioate linkages were introduced in its backbone. Confocal microscopy and FACS experiments showed that MPEG ODN 20 had a higher capacity to penetrate the cell membranes and accumulate in the nucleus of Panc- 1 cells than ODN 20. Incubation of Panc- 1 cells with MPEG ODN 20 reduced specifically the levels of Ki-ras mRNA and RAS protein p 21 RAS. A single-dose administration of MPEG ODN 20 was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation by about 50 % compared with control. By contrast, the antiproliferative activity of the unconjugated ODN 20 analog was found to be not significant. Band-shift and footprinting experiments showed that MPEG ODN 20 formed a weak triplex (Kd ∼ 1. 5 μM at 37 °C, 50 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7. 4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM spermidine) with the Ki-ras pyr/pur motif, suggesting that its bioactivity can hardly be mediated by a triplex-based mechanism. Here, we provide evidence that, in vitro, ODN 20 and MPEG ODN 20 competitively inhibit the binding to the Ki-ras pur/pyr motif of a nuclear protein, suggesting that the activity of MPEG ODN 20 occurs with an aptameric mechanism.

The frequency of these mutations was investigated in a panel of 52 colorectal cancer patients {{using a combination of}} immunocytochemistry and non-radioactive, digoxigenin-labelled in situ hybridisation. Sixty two per cent (32 of 52) of the study population were positive for p 53 overexpression and 36 % (19 of 52) positive for Ki-ras mutation. Twenty seven per cent (14 of 52) of the patients expressed both mutations. Mutation of either the p 53 or the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> did not correlate with Dukes's stage, tumour differentiation or 5 year survival rate of the patients. Most of the rectal carcinoma specimens (11 of 15) showed p 53 over-expression but the significance of this was not supported statistically. Thus detection of molecular changes is becoming more amenable to incorporation into routine histological carcinoma assessment because of the advent of non-radioactive labelling in in situ hybridisation and antibodies suitable for paraffin wax embedded specimens. The significance of these mutations in disease prognosis, however, remains questionable...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinomas {{were studied}} {{for the presence}} of p 53 gene mutations by the single-strand conformation polymorphism method and by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. p 53 protein expression was immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal PAb 1801 and polyclonal CM 1 antibodies. Mutations were detected in 14 cases. The transitions were six G to A and two A to G; the transversions were one C to G and two A to C; the remaining three were frameshift mutations. Immunostaining results were identical with both antibodies. Nuclear immunohistochemical p 53 -positive cells were found in nine p 53 mutated cases and in 12 cases in which no mutation was detected. In most of these latter cases only a minority of cancer cells showed immunohistochemical positivity. Twenty-nine cases, including all p 53 mutated cancers, were known to contain codon 12 <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations. Also {{in the light of the}} demonstrated cooperation of ras and p 53 gene alterations in the transformation of cultured cells, our data suggest that p 53 mutation is one of the genetic defects that may have a role in the pathogenesis of a proportion of pancreatic cancers...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Kirsten (Ki) -ras gene mutations was studied in 105 paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from 40 patients with pancreatic cancer, 48 with bile duct carcinoma (19 distal, 6 middle, and 23 proximal), 16 with ampullary carcinoma and 1 with duodenal cancer, by in vitro amplification of target sequences by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). With regard to pancreatic cancers, the authors' data confirm the very high frequency (88. 6 %) of <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations occurring at codon 12. Five pancreatic carcinomas did not contain the Ki-ras mutation and included rare types of histopathology. By histologic review after the examination of Ki-ras mutations through PCR, the diagnosis of four patients could be legitimately revised from other periampullary carcinoma to pancreatic carcinoma. In the ampullary carcinoma, the {{prevalence of}} mutations in Ki-ras codon 12 was 13. 3 %. Although {{there was a large}} difference in incidence of mutations between distal and middle or proximal bile duct carcinoma, the prevalence of mutations in bile duct carcinoma was limited to 19. 6 %. Unlike other approaches to diagnose periampullary carcinoma, detection of a mutation in Ki-ras codon 12 by PCR may distinguish pancreatic carcinoma from other periampullary carcinomas that have better prognoses...|$|E
40|$|Distinct genetic {{abnormalities}} (loss-of-function mutations of APC and p 53 and oncogenic {{activation of}} Ki-ras) are as-sociated with specific {{stages of the}} sporadic, most common types of colorectal tumors. However, the inability to main-tain primary colon epithelial cells in culture has hindered {{the analysis of the}} pathogenetic role of these abnormalities in colorectal tumorigenesis. We have now established pri-mary cultures of epithelial cells from the colon crypts of p 53 -deficient mice; these cells are nontumorigenic as indi-cated by their failure to form colonies in soft agar and to grow as tumors in immunodeficient SCID mice and in im-munocompetent syngeneic hosts. Upon ectopic expression of an activated <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene,</b> p 53 -deficient colon epithelial cells form colonies in soft agar and highly invasive subcuta-neous tumors in both immunodeficient and immunocompe-tent mice. Ectopic expression of wild-type p 53, but not of a DNA-binding–deficient mutant, markedly suppressed the colony-forming ability of the Ki-ras–transformed p 53 -defi-cient epithelial cells. Together, these findings establish a functional synergism in colorectal tumorigenesis dependent on the effects of an oncogenic Ki-ras in a p 53 -deficient background. This model of tumorigenic conversion of colon epithelial cells might be useful to identify genetic changes associated with disease progression and to evaluate the therapeutic response to conventional and novel anticancer drugs. ...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{alterations}} in the exon 1 {{region of the}} rat c-Ki-ras gene were studied in DNA isolated from aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) -induced rat liver carcinomas and precursor lesions appearing 56 weeks after administration of the carcinogen. To detect the mutations with high sensitivity, DNA samples were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in conjunction with allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization together with a modified PCR-G+C clamp-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method. Mutations in the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> were present in all adenomas and carcinomas examined. The predominant mutation observed was a G. C-to-A. T base transition in codon 12 (GGT to GAT). Also present, but at low frequency, was a G. C-to-T. A base transversion in the same codon (GGT to TGT). In addition, 20 % of the samples contained a G. C-to-T. A transversion in the second base position of codon 12 (GGT to GTT), a mutation not previously observed in AFB 1 -induced rat liver tumors. These results confirm and extend our previous findings that Ki-ras mutation is a prevalent event in hepato-cellular carcinogenesis induced in Fischer 344 rats by AFB 1. The modified DGGE method described is applicable to the screening of multiple mutations in neoplastic lesions with high fidelity and sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether tumor location proximal or distal to the splenic flexure is associated with distinct molecular patterns and can predict clinical outcome in a homogeneous group of patients with Dukes B (T 3 -T 4, N 0, M 0) colorectal cancer. It has been hypothesized that proximal and distal colorectal cancer may arise through different pathogenetic mechanisms. Although p 53 and <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations occur frequently in distal tumors, another form of genomic instability associated with defective DNA mismatch repair has been predominantly identified in the proximal colon. To date, however, the clinical usefulness of these molecular characteristics remains unproven. METHODS: A total of 126 patients with a lymph node-negative sporadic colon or rectum adenocarcinoma were prospectively assessed with the endpoint of death by cancer. No patient received either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. p 53 protein was studied by immunohistochemistry using DO- 7 monoclonal antibody, and p 53 and <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutations were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 67 months, the overall five-year survival was 70 percent. Nuclear p 53 staining was found in 57 tumors (47 percent), and was more frequent in distal than in proximal tumors (55 vs. 21 percent; chi-squared test, P < 0. 001). For the whole group, p 53 protein expression correlated with poor survival in univariate and multivariate analysis (log-rank test, P = 0. 01; hazard ratio = 2. 16; 95 percent confidence interval = 1. 12 - 4. 11, P = 0. 02). Distal colon tumors and rectal tumors exhibited similar molecular patterns and showed no difference in clinical outcome. In comparison with distal colorectal cancer, proximal tumors were found to be statistically significantly different on the following factors: mucinous content (P = 0. 008), degree of histologic differentiation (P = 0. 012), p 53 protein expression, and gene mutation (P = 0. 001 and 0. 01 respectively). Finally, patients with proximal tumors had a marginally better survival than those with distal colon or rectal cancers (log-rank test, P = 0. 045). CONCLUSION: In this series of Dukes B colorectal cancers, p 53 protein expression was an independent factor for survival, which also correlated with tumor location. Eighty-six percent of p 53 -positive tumors were located in the distal colon and rectum. Distal colon and rectum tumors had similar molecular and clinical characteristics. In contrast, proximal neoplasms seem to represent a distinct entity, with specific histopathologic characteristics, molecular patterns, and clinical outcome. Location of the neoplasm in reference to the splenic flexure should be considered before group stratification in future trials of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Dukes B tumors...|$|E
40|$|NRK cells {{infected}} with a temperature-sensitive Kirsten sarcoma virus (ts 371 KSV) are transformed at 36 degrees C, but are untransformed at 41 degrees C which inactivates the abnormally thermolabile oncogenic p 21 Ki {{product of the}} viral <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene.</b> At 41 degrees C, tsKSV-infected NRK cells were arrested in G 0 /G 1 when incubated in serum-free medium, but could then be stimulated to transit G 1, replicate DNA, and divide by adding serum at 41 degrees C or dropping the temperature to a p 21 -activating 36 degrees C without adding serum. When quiescent cells at 41 degrees C were stimulated to transit G 1 in serum-free medium by activating p 21 at 36 degrees C and then shifted back to the p 21 -inactivating 41 degrees C in the mid-S phase, they continued replicating DNA but could not transit G 2. Reactivating p 21 in the G 2 -arrested cells by once again lowering the temperature to 36 degrees C stimulated a rapid entry into mitosis. By contrast, while serum-stimulated quiescent G 0 cells at 41 degrees C replicate DNA and divide, serum did not induce G 2 -arrested cells to enter mitosis, indicating that serum growth factors may trigger events in the G 1 phase that ultimately determine G 2 transit. These observations made with the viral ras product suggest that cellular ras proto-oncogene products {{have a role in}} G 2 transit of normal cells...|$|E
40|$|Lung tumors were induced in Syrian golden hamsters by s. c. {{injection}} of 4 -(methylnitrosamino) -l-(3 -pyridyl) -l-butanone (NNK). After 40 weeks lung tumor tissue was isolated. Administration of the NNK and {{exposure of the}} animals to an atmosphere of 65 % oxygen resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor size but did not alter the histological tumor type or tumor incidence when compared with carcinogen treated animals maintained under ambient air. Histologically, lung tumors had the morphologic features of adenomas and adenocarcinomas with- 15 % being squamous cell carcinomas. Lung tumors were examined for mutations in the Ki-ras oncogene and the p 53 tumor suppressor gene by direct sequencing. The Ki-ras mutation frequency in RNA isolated from pooled tumors and hi DNA isolated from individual tumors {{were found to be}} identical. Activated Ki-ras alleles were detected in 77 - 94 % of tumors. All mutations observed (from a total of 65) except one were GC-AT. The Ki-ras mutations resulted hi ammo acid substitutions at either codons 12 or 13. No mutations were detected at the 61 st codon. Examination of the same tumors for p 53 mutations showed only one point mutation. We conclude that the NNK treatment hi Syrian golden hamsters results in a distinctive mutation pattern in the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene</b> whereas p 53 gene mutations may not play a major role at this stage in hamster lung tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|NRK rat kidney cells {{infected}} with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Kirsten sarcoma virus (ts 371) were transformed at 36 degrees C but were phenotypically nontransformed at 41 degrees C {{because of the}} abnormal thermolability of the oncogenic 21 -kilodalton product of the viral <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene.</b> Thus tsK-NRK cells were rendered quiescent in a G 0 -G 1 state by a 48 -h incubation in serum-free medium at the nonpermissive, p 21 -inactivating temperature of 41 degrees C. The serum-starved cells could then be stimulated to transit G 1 either as nontransformed cells by adding serum at 41 degrees C or as transformed cells by lowering the temperature to a p 21 -activating 36 degrees C. The viral p 21 protein was as effective as serum in stimulating tsK-NRK cells to transit G 1 and to start replicating DNA. While p 21 effectively stimulated cells to transit G 1 even in unconditioned, serum-free medium, they still needed cell-derived conditioning factors to subsequently divide. The p 21 protein also enabled the cells to transit G 1 in spite of an extracellular Ca 2 + deficiency that inhibited the G 1 transit of serum-stimulated cells. p 21 activity was needed to stimulate both early and late G 1 events. In contrast to serum, p 21 did not stimulate total RNA or protein synthesis, but some RNA and protein synthesis must have been needed for the p 21 -driven G 1 transit because it could be stopped by actinomycin D or cycloheximide...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} mode of action, ribozymes show {{antisense}} effects {{in addition to}} their specific cleavage activity. In the present study we investigated whether a hammerhead ribozyme is capable of cleaving mutated Ki-ras mRNA in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line and whether antisense effects contribute to the activity of the ribozyme. A 2 [prime]-O-allyl modified hammerhead ribozyme was designed to cleave specifically the mutated form of the Ki- ras mRNA (GUU motif in codon 12). The activity was monitored by RT-PCR on Ki- ras RNA expression by determination of the relative amount of wild type to mutant Ki-ras mRNA, by 5 -bromo- 2 [prime]-deoxy-uridine incorporation on cell proliferation and by colony formation in soft agar on malignancy in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line CFPAC- 1, which is heterozygous for the Ki-ras mutation. A catalytically inactive ribozyme was used as control to differentiate between antisense and cleavage activity and a ribozyme with random guide sequences as negative control. The catalytically active anti-Ki-ras ribozyme was at least 2 -fold more potent in decreasing cellular Ki-ras mRNA levels, inhibiting cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar than the catalytically inactive ribozyme. The catalytically active anti-Ki-ras ribozyme, but not the catalytically inactive or random ribozyme, increased the ratio of wild type to mutated Ki-ras mRNA in CFPAC- 1 cells. In conclusion, both cleavage activity and antisense effects contribute to the activity of the catalytically active anti-Ki-ras hammerhead ribozyme. Specific ribozymes might be useful in the treatment of pancreatic carcinomas containing an oncogenic GTT mutation in codon 12 of the <b>Ki-ras</b> <b>gene...</b>|$|E
