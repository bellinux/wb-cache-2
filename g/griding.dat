I actually saw myself a little bent-up, old, midget woman creeping down some stone steps out of a porch, with a fanlight, under a street lamp. It curdled my blood, that picture. And yet, I thought, what must be, must be. I will endure to be a little, bent-up, old, midget woman, creeping down stone steps out of a porch with a fanlight. And I even nodded up at the street lamp.|$|E

60|$|The {{river was}} swollen {{with the long}} rains. From Vadencourt {{all the way to}} Origny, it ran with ever-quickening speed, taking fresh heart at each mile, and racing as though it already smelt the sea. The water was yellow and turbulent, swung with an angry eddy among half-submerged willows, and made an angry clatter along stony shores. The course kept turning and turning in a narrow and well- timbered valley. Now the river would {{approach}} the side, and run <b>griding</b> along the chalky base of the hill, and show us a few open colza-fields among the trees. Now it would skirt the garden-walls of houses, where we might catch a glimpse through a doorway, and see a priest pacing in the chequered sunlight. Again, the foliage closed so thickly in front, that {{there seemed to be no}} issue; only a thicket of willows, overtopped by elms and poplars, under which the river ran flush and fleet, and where a kingfisher flew past like a piece of the blue sky. On these different manifestations the sun poured its clear and catholic looks. The shadows lay as solid on the swift surface of the stream as on the stable meadows. The light sparkled golden in the dancing poplar leaves, and brought the hills into communion with our eyes. And all the while the river never stopped running or took breath; and the reeds along the whole valley stood shivering from top to toe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that the filter-design problem with mask {{constraints}} can be formulated as a semi-infinite program. There are two approaches toward the solution of this semi-infinite program. The first <b>griding</b> approach relaxes the semi-infinite con-straint by refining it in the finite <b>griding</b> domain so it does not al-ways guarantee global optimal and feasible solution. The second semi-definite programming (SDP) -based approach does guarantee the global optimal solution and excellently handles positive real constraints. However, the magnitude constraints are still persis-tent and not yet handled by SDP tool in an efficient manner. In this brief, a new tight polyhedral approximation for semi-infinite constrained domain is proposed. Based on it, we present a new linear-programming-based solution method for filter design, which unlike the <b>griding</b> approach yields global solution and unlike SDP based approach is practical for even long-tap filters. Simulation re-sults confirm the viability of the proposed method. Index Terms—Finite-impulse response (FIR) filter, linear pro-gramming, semi-definite programming. I...|$|E

On {{example is the}} logging while drilling configuration where small features such as the annulus between the drill pipe and the formation, only about 1 / 10 or even smaller than the wavelength in the steel pipe, affect the wave field significantly. The FDTD scheme proposed in this paper improves computational efficiency and accuracy from three aspects: <b>griding,</b> differencing, and numerical truncation. Coordinate stretching, proving to be more accurate, stable, and easy to implement, is employed to achieve variable <b>griding.</b> A wavelet-based differencing scheme is derived and compared with conventional FDTD schemes with spatial truncation accuracy being 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th order. Because the wavelet-based and higher order FDTD scheme exhibits higher linear dispersion properties, it allows courser <b>griding</b> and is therefore more efficient. Reflections and transmission coefficients estimated from all FDTD schemes at a sharp boundary show that the wavelet-based FDTD solution outperforms the others.

Grids close to the sink, which have heavier traffic load, will have a smaller size compared with those are farther away, such that a shorter transmission range is used. Sensors that are far away have less traffic, but have to transmit over longer distance. This method will intuitively balance out the uneven traffic distribution due to geometric location, and thus make network lifetime much longer. i= 1 i= 2 q 1 −q i= 3 sink 0...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a neural-network-based recursive modeling scheme that constructs a nonlinear dynamical {{model for a}} discrete-time multichannel signal. Using the socalled radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network as a generic nonlinear model structure and the ideas developed in the classical adaptive control theory, {{we have been able}} to derive a stable and efficient weight updating algorithm that guarantees the convergence for both the prediction error and the weight error. A <b>griding</b> method developed in [11] based on the spatial Fourier analysis has been modified and applied for setting up the RBF neural net structure. Simulation analysis is also carried out to highlight the practical considerations in using the scheme. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and an Adjoint-Gradient (AG) Method {{applied to a}} two-dimensional Navier-Stokes code for airfoil design is presented. Both approaches use a common function evaluation code, the steady-state explicit part of the code,ARC 2 D. The parameterization of the design space is a common B-spline approach for an airfoil surface, which together with a common <b>griding</b> approach, restricts the AG and EA to the same design space. Results are presented for a class of viscous transonic airfoils in which the optimization tradeoff between drag minimization as one objective and lift maximization as another, produces the multi-objective design space. Comparisons are made for efficiency, accuracy and design consistency...|$|E

All he seemed to know, for certain, was, that he, <b>Gride,</b> paid Ralph's debt; but that, to anybody who knew the circumstances of Bray's detention--even to Bray himself, on Ralph's own statement--must be perfectly notorious. As to the fraud on Madeline herself, his visitor knew so little about its nature or extent, {{that it might be}} a lucky guess, or a hap-hazard accusation. Whether or no, he had clearly no key to the mystery, and could not hurt him who kept it close within his own breast. The allusion to friends, and the offer of money, <b>Gride</b> held to be mere empty vapouring, for purposes of delay. 'And even if money were to be had,' thought Arthur <b>Gride,</b> as he glanced at Nicholas, and trembled with passion at his boldness and audacity, 'I'd have that dainty chick for my wife, and cheat YOU of her, young smooth-face!' ...|$|R
