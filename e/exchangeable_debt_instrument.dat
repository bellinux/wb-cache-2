Comparisons between issuers' holdings in different firms shed light on issuers' performance as monitors as well as their ability to engage in market timing. Holdings attached to these issues display superior past operating performance, but after the offer, both operating performance and stock returns decline. In contrast, we do not find similar systematic performance patters for the "other holdings" of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>debt</b> issuers. <b>Exchangeable</b> <b>debt</b> Market timing Operating performance Convertible debt...|$|R

40|$|The bill of exchange, the {{promissory}} note and the cheque are <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> {{regulated by the}} bill of exchange law. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are differentiated from other instruments used in civil and commercial relations by {{the inclusion of the}} <b>debt</b> in the <b>instrument,</b> hence the name of <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> The main features of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are: formal, literal and autonomous nature. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are formal {{in the sense that the}} creation, the existence, the circulation and the exercise and the use of the patrimonial rights included depend on the existence of the elements included in the instrument. Moreover, the high rigorous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> is reflected by the obligation to meet some requirements regarding the form (the bill of exchange, the {{promissory note}} and the cheque imply some compulsory requirements in order to be valid). The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are literal, in the sense that the existence and the coverage of the patrimonial rights are established through the wording included in the instrument; thus, the juridical relation that caused the issuing of the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> no longer influences the right deriving from the instrument (whether a sales-purchase agreement, or a loan or a debt opening); no possibility for the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> to be interpreted or completed with other documents. The autonomous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> can be seen, on the one hand, in relation to the fundamental juridical relation that caused it, and in this case, we shall consider that the individual who issued the instrument has an obligation which is not under the existing fundamental relation but exclusively under the instrument which the individual signed; on the other hand, each new signatory has an autonomous juridical position and acquires a new, original right, not a transferred right. The autonomy of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> explains the principle according to which the holder of the instrument exercises one’s own right and exceptions cannot be opposed to him, namely the protection measures that could be opposed to the previous holders (principle of non-opposability of exceptions) ...|$|R

40|$|As U. S. Treasury {{securities}} {{carry the}} full faith and credit of the U. S. government, {{they are free}} of default risk. Thus, their yields are risk-free rates of return, which allows the most recently issued U. S. Treasury securities {{to be used as}} a benchmark to price other fixed-income instruments. This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U. S. Treasury benchmarks and related <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> with implications for portfolio composition. Thirty year treasuries, Aaa bonds, and mortgages tend to dominate the other instruments, at least to the second order.

One of {{its major}} {{elements}} are <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> including the treasury <b>debt</b> <b>instruments.</b> They {{are important for}} the economy and its various participants, including the banking sector, because they attend primary and secondary markets. The presentation focuses on areas of bank’s activity in the treasury <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> (bills) and T-bonds market. First, the significance of above issues is connected {{with the role of}} Treasury <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> (financing the needs of the state budget and enabling the surplus funds transfer between sectors).

While dealing with <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> it is necessary to concentrate on their essence, diversity, emission targets and potential investors.

40|$|The {{definition}} of deposit substitutes in Philippine tax law fails {{to consider the}} maturity of a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> This {{makes it possible for}} long-term bonds to be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20 -lender rule, taxable at 20 % final tax. However, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot realistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of 20 or more lenders. First, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot simultaneously replicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are integral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes {{are an integral part of}} the maturity transformation process (i. e. short-term borrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries, which means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by having short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates the function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where said instruments originated and are generally used. To show the incompatibility between a deposit substitute and a long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> the paper applies the fundamental theory of bond values to 10 -year zero-coupon treasury notes called 'PEACe Bonds' in Banco De Oro, et al. vs. Republic (2015 and 2016).
