25|$|My own “felicitous fall” {{took place}} when I {{was working on}} a new gym for Portland State College (now University). I was three stories up, walking along {{scaffolding}} with a bucket of clip-ties in my arms when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> saved my life.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her and bent over, forgetting that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' Oh, my goodness! I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; I was sick of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like my wardrobe. I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs {{recorded}} for the album, and marked the beginning of the Gambino aliases used for the members who appeared on the album, and would eventually become highly influential on hip hop. Raekwon later explained [...] "The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I used to like that movie Once Upon a Time in America, with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, [...] "Tony Starks" [...] came from Iron Man. [...] "Lou Diamond" [...] came from Louis Roederer who made Cristal, and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a lot of ice, was calling shit ice. But then I started giving some of my niggas in the crew names. Being that it's my album, I wanted niggas to know, you gotta have a certain a.k.a. when you're on this track. This is a Gambino track. Wu-Gambinos. I would call Masta Killa [...] "Noodles," [...] call GZA [...] "Maximillian." [...] Inside the movie (Once Upon a Time in America), Noodles and Max was partners. I felt like GZA was like Maximillian because he was like the brains of the crew. He would say something real intellectual and smart. I called Deck [...] "Rollie Fingers" [...] cause of the way he roll blunts. So names just started fitting niggas." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E

60|$|After that, I {{took the}} tin off myself, and {{hammered}} {{at it with}} the mast till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> out and sick at heart, whereupon Harris took it in hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is thy turn to watch, Priest," [...] said Gwenoch to Ailward. [...] "So {{keep the}} door well, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out with hunting," [...] and so fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|My costume, {{or rather}} my disguise, for, as I have said, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a poke bonnet with a plain black dress, seemed to puzzle him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{glanced down}} at the new patent leathers which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing.</b> [...] "How on earth--" [...] I began, but Holmes {{answered}} my question before it was asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not attired for the proceeding," [...] Crawshay admitted. [...] "I was, in fact, very inappropriately dressed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a thin flannel suit, {{which was}} {{completely}} ruined, and I {{do not think}} that I shall ever be warm again." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wearing</b> {{the last}} white shirt that will embellish my person for many a day--for I do hope that <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> out of Carson long before this reaches you.|$|R
60|$|None of them {{interested}} me very greatly. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> {{out with the}} filth and greed and foolishness {{of many of these}} men. They were commonplace citizens, turned into stampeders without experience or skill.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a long ride," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out. <b>I</b> {{hope you will}} not mind, but for myself I cannot talk when motoring. Smoke, if it pleases you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In no way, Ralph, {{thanks to}} my shirt of mail. Well, indeed, was it for me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> it, or I should assuredly have been a dead man. I had almost begun to forget that I was a {{threatened}} man; but I shall be on guard for the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I remembered {{you very}} distinctly, {{and some things}} I thought about you, but not where it had happened. Then in the night I got it. It is a puzzle, isn't it? You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a black gown, and I {{had been out of}} the {{sunlight}} for some months--and my eye, I remember it acutely, was bandaged. I'm usually bandaged somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid {{no one but}} myself {{would see}} the humor of it," [...] Tavernake answered. [...] "I was {{thinking}} of those days in London; I was thinking of Beatrice's horror when she discovered that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> ready-made clothes, and the amazement of Elizabeth when she found that I hadn't a dress suit. It's odd how cramped life gets back there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It might if I {{knew how}} to work it," [...] said the little girl. [...] "Ozma knows {{a lot of its}} magic, but I've never found out about it. All <b>I</b> know <b>is</b> that while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wearing</b> it, nothing can hurt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The doctors {{find they}} are {{again on the}} wrong tack. They cannot make out what the disease is. O Cytherea! how I wish they knew! This {{suspense}} <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> me out. Could not Miss Aldclyffe spare you for a day? Do come to me. We {{will talk about the}} best course then. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry to complain, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I teach {{school like}} {{one in a}} dream," [...] {{continued}} Gertrude; [...] "then I come home and shut myself {{in my room and}} walk the floor. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wearing</b> a path right across Nan's carpet. We are so horribly near this war." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced down}} at my waistcoat, and saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> my tourist's check suit, of grey and mud colour, with which a Bond Street tailor had {{supplied}} me just before leaving town, as the latest thing out in fancy tweeds. Evidently these Egyptians must have a very curious standard of taste not to admire our pretty and graceful style of male attire.|$|E
60|$|MISS SUSAN. I always {{associate}} it with a sprigged poplin <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> that summer, with a {{breadth of}} coloured silk in it, being a naval officer; but something happened, a Miss Cicely Pemberton, and they are quite big boys now. So long ago, Phoebe--he was very tall, with brown hair--it was most foolish of me, but I was always so fond of sewing--with long straight legs and such a pleasant expression.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{had been}} walking along, a sudden thought had struck me. At Oudenarde, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> the same boots I had worn {{when we were}} {{captured}} together. When we took the money out, we each left, if you remember, five pieces of gold {{in one of our}} boots, which I had never thought of till that day; and, as I came along, I opened the sole and took them out. It was a perfect godsend, as you may guess.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought, boastfully, {{that they}} never could break my heart, Mr. Jarndyce. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{resolved}} that they should not. I did believe that I could, and would, charge them with being the mockery they <b>were</b> until <b>I</b> died of some bodily disorder. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out. How long <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wearing</b> out, <b>I</b> don't know; I seemed to break down in an hour. I hope they may never come to hear of it. I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them, consistently and perseveringly, as I did through so many years." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A lot {{of people}} ask me why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wearing</b> a mask. The mask {{is more of a}} sign and a symbol of unity and being alike each other, rather than me being different." [...] said Walker, behind the scenes of the single [...] "Alone".|$|R
5000|$|He told a {{newspaper}} reporter: [...] "Three more days of prospecting would have finished me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> out physically, financially and mentally, when I made the big find, but then, the gold cure {{is a good}} one, and now I feel young again." ...|$|R
6000|$|So I dismounted, and, having assured {{herself that}} I had no heels to my boots (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> {{the kind of}} raw-hide {{slippers}} that the Boers call [...] "veld-shoon"), she took the writing slate which she was carrying--it had no frame, I remember, being, in fact, but {{a piece of the}} material used for roofing--and, pressing it down tight on my stubbly hair, which stuck up then as now, made a deep mark in the soft sandstone of the wall with the hard pointed pencil.|$|E
60|$|But {{no sooner}} {{was he in}} my arms than I seemed to see Mary and her husband and Irene bearing down upon my {{chambers}} to take him from me, and acting under an impulse I whipped him into the perambulator and was off with it without a license down the back staircase. To the Kensington Gardens we went; {{it may have been}} Manitoba we started for, but we arrived at the Kensington Gardens, and it had all been so unpremeditated and smartly carried out that I remember clapping my hand to my head in the street, to make sure that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{was your}} father. The first I ever saw of him was at Cullew, four lang miles frae Thrums. There was a ball after the market, and Esther Auld and me went to it. We went in a cart, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> a pink print, wi' a white bonnet, and blue ribbons that tied aneath the chin. I had a shawl abune, no' to file them. There wasna a more {{innocent}} lassie in Thrums, man, no, nor a happier one; for Aaron Latta--Aaron came half the way wi' us, and he was hauding my hand aneath the shawl. He hadna speired me at that time, but I just kent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Kendal has excused,' said Mrs. Dusautoy, {{bursting}} into a merry fit of laughter. 'Oh, I {{never heard anything}} more charming than your introduction! I beg your pardon, but I laughed last evening till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> out, and waked in the night laughing again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{might think}} it was this that caused my death. It <b>was</b> not. <b>I</b> {{know very well that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out, and that I should have gone soon in any case. And I must leave Cynthia to him. He loves her as his own child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ishmael!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} in dismay, then {{recovered}} herself and added: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not afraid of}} Ishmael, for here his life is in my hand. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worn</b> out; <b>I</b> cannot talk of the man to-night. I must sleep, Noie, I must sleep. Come, lie at my side and let us sleep." ...|$|R
