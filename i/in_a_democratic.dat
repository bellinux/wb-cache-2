5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
5|$|Ted Kennedy was 30 {{years old}} when he first entered the Senate {{following}} a November 1962 special election to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother, John, who was now the President. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming President. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who later lost the general election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|The current 500 {{members of}} the National Assembly were elected during the 2011 {{parliamentary}} election, {{and they have a}} five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic,</b> fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million people voted. In their respective constituencies, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Trương Tấn Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. Lê Thị Thu Ba, a member of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007–2011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly. Several capitalists were elected to the assembly, but due to the socialist ideology of the state, they are not allowed to sit on the assembly's Committee on Economy and Budget.|$|E
