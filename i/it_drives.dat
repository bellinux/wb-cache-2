5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while <b>it</b> <b>drives</b> off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that <b>it</b> <b>drives</b> from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} <b>it</b> <b>drives</b> the geometry to flatness.|$|E
5|$|The two {{components}} of the proton-motive force are thermodynamically equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy {{is provided by the}} potential; in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the fusobacterium Propionigenium modestum <b>it</b> <b>drives</b> the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) observes {{his car in}} her {{driveway}} and, not wishing her son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) to see <b>it,</b> <b>drives</b> it a {{few blocks}} away to conceal it. Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When he hesitates to do so without identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo. Elsewhere, Skyler's sister Marie (Betsy Brandt) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank (Dean Norris), who is still bedridden after the attempt on his life.|$|E
