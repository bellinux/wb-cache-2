We then design a set of data transformations that seek to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms of detailed sharing. These include a novel approach to interactive modification of fine-grained step data, allowing people to remove private data and using motif discovery to generate realistic replacement data.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hierarchical approach for object-based motion description of video {{in terms of}} object motions and object-to-object interactions. We present a temporal hierarchy for object motion description, which consists of low-level elementary motion units (EMU) and high-level action units (AU). Likewise, object-to-object interactions are decomposed into a hierarchy of lowlevel elementary reaction units (ERU) and high-level interaction units (IU). We then propose an algorithm for temporal segmentation of video objects into EMUs, whose dominant motion can be described by a single representative parametric model. The algorithm also computes a representative (dominant) aftinc model for each EMU. We also provide algorithms for identification of ERUs and for classification {{of the type of}} ERUs. Experimental results demonstrate that segmenting the life-span of video objects into EMUs and ERUs facilitates the generation of <b>high-level</b> visual <b>summaries</b> for fast browsing and navigation.

40|$|HER- 2 is the {{molecular}} target for antibody-based treatment {{of breast cancer}} (trastuzumab). The potential benefit of anti-HER- 2 therapy is currently investigated in several other HER- 2 amplified cancers. For example, trastuzumab was recently shown {{to be effective in}} HER- 2 positive gastric cancer. To address the potential applicability of anti-HER- 2 therapy in colorectal cancer, tissue microarray sections and colorectal resection specimens of 1851 colorectal cancers were analyzed for HER- 2 overexpression and amplification using FDA approved reagents for immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. HER- 2 amplification was seen in 2. 5 % and HER- 2 overexpression in 2. 7 % of 1439 interpretable colorectal cancers. Amplification was often high level with HER- 2 copies ranging from 4 to 60 per tumor cell and was strongly related to protein overexpression. HER- 2 amplification and overexpression were unrelated to histological tumor type, tumor localization, grading, pT, pN, pM or survival. As heterogeneity of drug target expression could represent a major drawback for targeted cancer therapy we next studied HER- 2 heterogeneity in selected cases. Extensive evaluation of all available large sections from patients with HER- 2 positive colorectal cancer revealed heterogenous findings in 3 of 4 cases. In <b>summary,</b> <b>high-level</b> HER- 2 amplification occurs in a small fraction of colorectal cancers.

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{exposure to}} high-level occupations {{in relation to}} the well-known survival advantage of women compared with men of the same age. Women in the federal workforce in positions of General Schedule 14 and above in 1979 – 1993 (n = 4, 727) were each matched with three men (n = 14, 181) by age, General Schedule level, and supervisory role. Fifteen-year mortality rates were compared between men and women and against expected 15 -year mortality from the US general population. Despite similar job demands, women experienced markedly lower 15 -year mortality than did men. However, men in these positions had nearly 50 % lower mortality compared with age-matched men in the general population; the comparable reduction for women was 38 %. The simultaneous substantial, but unequal by gender, improvement in mortality resulted in a reduced male/female mortality ratio, from 1. 67 in the general population to 1. 40. The reduced male/female mortality ratio was especially prominent for cancer and was not evident for heart disease mortality. Survival was nominally higher in non-White than in White participants. In <b>summary,</b> <b>high-level</b> employment is associated with substantially reduced mortality in both men and women.

40|$|The Outer Thames Estuary Regional Environmental Characterisation (REC) {{provides}} an environmental reference statement defining marine and seabed conditions within the study area. Prior to this study, regional environmental {{assessment of the}} Outer Thames Estuary was based upon dispersed data acquired over several decades. The Marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF) has provided the opportunity to acquire and interpret an integrated physical and biological dataset {{for the first time}} in this region. The dataset was acquired along geophysical survey transects spaced 10 – 20 km apart and grab samples were recovered at the intersection of survey lines. The Outer Thames Estuary REC provides a unique, robust scientific basis to define the regional marine environment, outlining the character of seabed conditions in the study area. This will permit informed, confident and consistent decision-making and consequently the Outer Thames Estuary REC will be of value to all stakeholders including government, marine industry, planners and environmentalists. The knowledge will contribute to the protection of the marine environment, promote the sustainable management of the seabed and focus future development investment. The Outer Thames Estuary REC develops the approach initially adopted in previous marine aggregate regional characterisation studies but also makes a comprehensive assessment of the heritage issues. The characterisation process begins by reviewing the physical conditions in the area, for example tides, currents, seabed geology and seabed sediment transport. The heritage assessment has been combined with the interpretation of the Quaternary geology to produce an integrated assessment, whilst the wreck and other modern archaeology are treated separately. Analysis of the benthic infauna and epifauna communities is combined with an evaluation of their associated physical conditions to produce a habitat and biotope assessment. The principle characterisation is supplemented with <b>high-level</b> <b>summaries</b> of marine mammals, birds and anthropogenic activities for context. The characterisation process also highlights regional environmental sensitivities, for example sites of potential conservation, fisheries or heritage significance, as well as informing marine spatial planning. Geology and Heritage The seabed consists of three distinct morphological zones. The Western Zone is dominated by a large coast-parallel sandbank system. The sandbanks are composed of well sorted fine-medium grained sand whilst sandy gravels lie on the seabed in the troughs between the banks. The Central Zone consists of a bedrock platform typically overlain by a discontinuous, thin, gravelly lag deposit, dispersed sandy bedforms and isolated sandbanks. Two parallel, north-south trending troughs, the Inner Gabbard Deeps, have been eroded into the bedrock in this zone. The seabed in the Eastern Zone consists of an extensive sand dune field. In general there is a net seabed sediment transport to the south across the area. The Outer Thames Estuary REC survey has revealed a geological and archaeological record of previously unquantified significance. The combined interpretation of bathymetry of varying resolutions, sub-bottom data, a limited amount of core and grab material and a full review of the extant geological and archaeological record, has achieved a significantly enhanced interpretation of the Outer Thames Estuary. Of central importance is the identification of c. 1, 500 km 2 of submerged palaeo-landscape dating from c. 720, 000 BP. This represents a significant feature of both geological and archaeological interest. The seabed in the Outer Thames Estuary mainly comprises a thin, superficial layer of mobile and immobile sediments overlying exposures of Quaternary, Cenozoic and Cretaceous sediments. Ten enclosed deeps are identified and interpreted as being formed at the margin of the Elsterian-Anglian glacial maximum ice limit. The stratigraphic relationship of these features with the major eastwest river system (the Thames-Medway) that cuts across the Outer Thames Estuary REC area suggests this channel must have been incised prior to this glaciation (Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 12 : c. 450 kaBP). Further, the spatial correlation of this channel system with terrestrial river terrace gravels on the Essex coast suggests it may have been formed as early as Cromerian Complex II (OIS 18 : c. 720 kaBP), but at least by OIS 15 (c. 600 kaBP). The southern edge of the Outer Thames Estuary REC area does cross the northern margin of the post-Elsterian/Anglian Thames-Medway river courses as they migrate southwards and separate to become the modern Thames and Medway systems. Again, through spatial correlation with the terrestrial record, c. 40 m thick sections of river channel infill sediments have been identified, which may hold a record of 450, 000 years of sedimentation. The Outer Thames Estuary REC study reveals a potentially highly significant record from an archaeological perspective. There are two broad categories of submerged archaeological material that may potentially exist within the Outer Thames Estuary REC area: shipwreck sites and terrestrially deposited archaeological material subsequently inundated by rising sea levels. In terms of the wreck record 1, 576 individual incidents are documented for the area, with an additional seven anomalies identified as a part of the characterisation process. The wrecks for which details were available date from between AD 1320 – 2005, and range in type from fishing vessels, through submarines, to second world war aircraft. Available survey data only covered a small proportion of the total area considered, and as such the location of only c. 6 % of wrecks recorded in the UKHO could be verified. With regard to submerged terrestrially deposited archaeology, the Outer Thames Estuary REC area parallels one of the most important stretches of coastline for Palaeolithic archaeology in the British Isles. Bracketed by the key internationally significant Lower Palaeolithic sites of Clacton (to the south) and Pakefield (to the north), the coastline in this region has produced evidence for the earliest occupation of the British Isles at c. 600 – 700, 000 BP. As such, the determination of a large area of submerged landscape dating from 720, 000 BP offshore of these sites is deemed to be highly significant and worthy of future investigation to evaluate its potential. This determination is based on the value of this landscape as a resource to inform about the broader changes which occurred through the Pleistocene and into the Holocene, as much as the possibility for preservation of primary and secondary context archaeological material. In addition, there is a third class of archaeological material found within the survey area; the modern terrestrial feature of Walton-on-the Naze Pier which extends c. 17 m into the Outer Thames Estuary REC. This is a significant local feature and forms part of a conservation area...|$|R
