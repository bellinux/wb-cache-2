40|$|We {{show that}} the price of risk and {{quantity}} of risk are negatively correlated in the time-series for benchmark factors in equities and currencies. Managed portfolios that <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> exposures when volatility is low and decrease exposure when volatility is high thus produce positive alphas and <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> Sharpe ratios. We also find volatility timing to be more beneficial to a mean variance investor than expected return timing by a fairly wide margin. These portfolio timing strategies are simple to implement in real time and are contrary to conventional wisdom because volatility tends to be high at the beginning of recessions and crises when selling is often viewed as a mistake. The facts are potentially puzzling because they imply that effective risk aversion would have to be low when volatility is high, and vice versa. ∗Yale School of Management.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) composites containing different concentrations of iron particles in a silicone matrix {{and the change}} of these properties in a magnetic field of variable strength were investigated. MRE samples with small and large iron particles as well as isotropic and anisotropic particle arrangements in the silicone matrix were compared. The results show a strong increase of the storage and loss moduli of the MRE in the magnetic field. A more pronounced influence of the anisotropic configuration was observed for the samples with small particles than for those with large particles. The relative <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> of the storage modulus in the magnetic field {{was found to be}} an order of magnitude higher for the composites with large than with small particles.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{analyses}} of severe air ingress accidents in high temperature gas-cooled reactors the present report deals with the kinetics of the reactions between oxygen and the graphitic fuel element matrix materials A 3 - 3 and A 3 - 27. Kinetic experiments covering a temperature range of approx. 950 to 1200 K (approx. 680 to 930 ° C) {{and a range of}} oxygen partial pressures between 1500 and 15000 Pa (0, 015 and 0, 15 bar) at a constant total pressure of 1, 5 bar (carrier gas Helium) are presented.

40|$|Geopolymers are a {{promising}} class of inorganic materials typically obtained from an alluminosilicate source and an alkaline solution, and {{characterized by an}} amorphous 3 -D framework structure. These materials are particularly attractive for the construction industry due to mechanical and environmental advantages they exhibit compared to conventional systems. Indeed, geopolymer-based concretes represent a challenge for the large scale uses of such a binder material and many research studies currently focus on this topic. However, the behaviour of geopolymers under high dynamic loads is rarely investigated, {{even though it is}} of a fundamental concern for the integrity/vulnerability assessment under extreme dynamic events. The present study aims to investigate the effect of high dynamic loading conditions on the tensile behaviour of different geopolymer formulations. The dynamic tests were performed under different strain rates by using a Hydro-pneumatic machine and a modified Hopkinson bar at the DynaMat laboratory of the University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland. The results are processed in terms of stress-strain relationships and strength dynamic <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> at different strain-rate levels. The dynamic <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> was also compared with CEB recommendations. The experimental outcomes can be used to assess the constitutive laws of geopolymers under dynamic load conditions and implemented into analytical models. © 2015 Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences...|$|E

40|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete structures subjected to blast effects, response {{at very high}} strain rates (up to 1000 s- 1) is often sought. At these high strain rates, the apparent strength of concrete can increase significantly. The dynamic <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> (DIF), i. e. {{the ratio of the}} dynamic to static strength, is normally reported as function of strain rate. For concrete, the DIF can be more than 2 in compression, and more than 6 in tension. Knowledge of the DIF is of significant importance in the design and analysis of structures for explosives safety. DIF curves for concrete have been published in manuals by the Tri-Services, the Defense Special Weapons Agency, the Air Force, and the Department of Energy. However, these curves are typically based on limited data. A literature review was conducted to determine the extant data to characterize the effects of strain rate on the compressive and tensile strengths of concrete. This data support the dynamic <b>increase</b> <b>factor</b> (DIF) being a bilinear function of the strain rate in a log-log plot. The DIF formulation recommended by the European CEB was described, together with its origins.

25|$|The {{conformational}} change most relevant for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal {{region of the}} reactive site loop (circled in Figure 4 model B).
