5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the <b>dosing</b> of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the <b>dosing</b> of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all.

40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of high <b>dose</b> rate (HDR) brach-ytherapy source step size, source dwell position, <b>dose</b> prescription depth, <b>dose</b> specification points and optimization technique on <b>dose</b> distribution around Microselectron HDR brachytherapy vaginal cylinders and to evaluate the influence of distal dwell position and optimization technique on rectal and bladder <b>dose</b> of patients treated for vaginal cuff irradiation. Materials/MethodsOrthogonal radiographs of vaginal cylinders of diameter 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 cm form the basis of the study. <b>Dose</b> distribution using the PLATO brachytherapy treatment planning system (version 14. 1) was generated. Two different HDR cylinder models, namely the non-curved dome model (NCDM) and curved dome model (CDM), were studied. To evaluate bladder and rectum <b>dose</b> in the patients NCDM was used. ResultsCDM gives more uniform <b>dose</b> distribution around the cylinder than NCDM. <b>Dose</b> prescription at 5 mm depth from the surface results in very high <b>dose</b> to apex and dome as compared with the surface <b>dose</b> prescription. <b>Dose</b> prescription depth and dwell positions influence the length of prescription isodose. Optimization method and dwell positions affect the bladder and rectal <b>dose</b> of the studied patients. ConclusionsUniform <b>dose</b> distribution can be obtained for HDR vaginal cylinders by appropriately selecting <b>dose</b> specification points and optimization method. <b>Dose</b> distribution can be configured to provide a uniform <b>dose</b> on the surface, if the apex and curved surface of the cylinder are considered for <b>dose</b> specification and optimization.

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin <b>dosing</b> requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
40|$|Avoiding toxicities in {{radiotherapy}} {{requires the}} knowledge of tolerable organ <b>doses.</b> For new, experimental fractionation schemes (e. g. hypofractionation) these are typically derived from traditional schedules using the Biologically Effective <b>Dose</b> (BED) model. In this report we investigate the difficulties of establishing mean <b>dose</b> tolerances that arise since the mean BED depends on the entire spatial <b>dose</b> distribution, {{rather than on the}} <b>dose</b> level alone. &# 13; &# 13; Methods: A formula has been derived to establish mean physical <b>dose</b> constraints such that they are mean BED equivalent to a reference treatment scheme. This formula constitutes a modified BED equation where the influence of the spatial <b>dose</b> distribution is summarized in a single parameter, the <b>dose</b> shape factor. To quantify effects we analyzed 24 liver cancer patients for whom both proton and photon IMRT treatment plans were available. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The results show that the standard BED equation - neglecting the spatial <b>dose</b> distribution - can overestimate mean <b>dose</b> tolerances for hypofractionated treatments by up to 20 %. The shape difference between photon and proton <b>dose</b> distributions can cause 30 - 40 % differences in mean physical <b>dose</b> for plans having identical mean BEDs. Converting hypofractionated, 5 / 15 -fraction proton <b>doses</b> to mean BED equivalent photon <b>doses</b> in traditional 35 -fraction regimens resulted in up to 10 Gy higher <b>doses</b> than applying the standard BED formula. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: The <b>dose</b> shape effect should be accounted for to avoid overestimation of mean <b>dose</b> tolerances, particularly when estimating constraints for hypofractionated regimens. Additionally, tolerances established for one treatment modality cannot necessarily be applied to other modalities with drastically different <b>dose</b> distributions, such as proton therapy.

40|$|Aim: To {{establish}} {{whether a}} radical <b>dose</b> of {{external beam radiotherapy}} (EBRT) can be given to intermediate risk endometrial cancer patients with a solitary pelvic node recurrence, who have previously been treated with vaginal vault brachytherapy (VVB), without exceeding the <b>dose</b> tolerance of the pelvic organs at risk (OAR). Objectives: To calculate the total <b>dose</b> each OAR would be exposed to after VVB and EBRT and assess whether the OAR <b>doses</b> breach the departments <b>dose</b> tolerances; {{to determine whether the}} <b>doses</b> to OAR can be predicted by knowing the VVB OAR <b>dose</b> alone; to determine what factors influence the total <b>dose</b> given to OAR after VVB and EBRT is given. Methods: A retrospective service evaluation was carried out on previously treated VVB computed tomography (CT) datasets. A simple conformal radical <b>dose</b> EBRT plan, covering a solitary pelvic node recurrence, was created on each dataset and the total <b>dose</b> the OAR are exposed to was assess for OAR <b>dose</b> tolerance breach. The percentage of patients whose total OAR <b>doses</b> exceeded the OAR <b>dose</b> tolerances was then calculated. The percentage deviation between VVB OAR <b>dose</b> and the total OAR <b>dose</b> was worked out and assessed for a common trend. A Spearman’s correlation coefficient score was used to determine a relationship between the volume of the OAR and the two treatment plan OAR <b>doses.</b> Results: 80 patient CT datasets were used in the service evaluation. 67 per cent (%) of patients were able to receive a radical <b>dose</b> simple oblique EBRT plan without exceeding the OAR <b>dose</b> tolerances. There was no consistent percentage deviation between VVB OAR <b>doses</b> and total OAR <b>doses</b> and, therefore, the total <b>dose</b> cannot be predicted. A strong positive relationship exists between the bladder volume and EBRT <b>dose</b> (0. 516, p< 0. 001); the rectum volume and VVB <b>dose</b> (0. 59, p< 0. 001) and EBRT <b>dose</b> (0. 628, p< 0. 001); the small bowel volume and VVB <b>dose</b> (0. 605, p< 0. 001) and EBRT <b>dose</b> (0. 702, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The simple EBRT plan used shows it is possible for the majority of patients to undergo further irradiation to the pelvis without overdosing the OAR. The total <b>dose</b> to the OAR varies from patient to patient and is dependent on the position of the OAR within the pelvis and the volume of the OAR.
