While techniques for accurately simulating structures and continua have advanced rapidly, methods for simulating contact between solids have lagged behind.

We present a new discrete velocity-level formulation of <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> dynamics that reduces to a pair of coupled projections and introduce a simple fixed-point property of this coupled system. This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is devoted}} to {{a study of the}} {{classical}} homogenization process and its influence on the behavior of a composite under non-linear dynamic loading due to contact and friction. First, the general problem of convergence of numerical models subjected to dynamic contact with friction loading is addressed. The use of a regularized friction law allows obtaining good convergence of such models. This study shows that for a dynamic contact with friction loading, the classical homogenization process, coupled with an homogenization of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact,</b> enables replacing the entire heterogeneous model by a homogenized one. The dynamic part of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> must be homogenized by modifying the dynamic parameter of the friction law. Modification of the dynamic parameter of the friction law is function of the type and regime of instability. A calculation of a homogenized friction coefficient is presented in view to homogenizing the static part of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> when the friction coefficient is not constant over the contact surface. Finally matrix and heterogeneities stresses in the heterogeneous models are identified by using the relocalization process and a <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> dynamic analysis of a homogeneous model...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an algorithm for solving anisotropic <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> problems where the sliding rule is non-associated. The algorithm {{is based on}} a variational formulation of the complex interface model that combine the classical unilateral contact law and an anisotropic friction model with a non-associated slip rule. Both the friction condition and the sliding potential are elliptical and have the same principal axes but with different semi-axes ratio. The <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> law and its inverse are derived from a single non-differentiable scalar-valued function, called a bi-potential. The convexity properties of the bi-potential permit to associate stationary principles with initial/boundary value problems. With the present formulation, the time-integration of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> law {{takes the form of a}} projection onto a convex set and only one predictor-corrector step addresses all cases (sticking, sliding, no-contact).

40|$|An {{improved}} algorithm {{based on}} the contact dynamics approach is proposed. Like previous developed algorithms it involves two stages. In the first one (local stage) for each particle, forces are computed from the relative displacement using an interaction law, which models <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> and shock. In the second stage (global stage) Newton's second law is used to determine, for each particle, the resulting acceleration which is then time-integrated to find the new particle positions. This process is repeated for each time step until convergence is achieved. The two distinguishing features of the present algorithm are the local integration of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> law and the convergence criterion. By adopting a variational statement of the <b>frictional</b> <b>contact</b> law {{based on the}} bi-potential concept, the integration procedure is reduced to a single predictor-corrector step and a new convergence criterion is introduced.
