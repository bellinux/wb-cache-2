500|$|The keel of {{the future}} Mary Celeste was laid in late 1860 at the {{shipyard}} of Joshua Dewis {{in the village of}} Spencer's Island, on the shores of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. The ship was constructed of locally felled timber, with two masts, and was rigged as a brigantine; she was carvel-built, with the <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> flush rather than overlapping. She was launched on May 18, 1861, given the name Amazon, and registered at nearby Parrsboro on June 10, 1861. Her registration documents described her as [...] in length, [...] broad, with a depth of , and of 198.42 gross tonnage. She was owned by a local consortium of nine people, headed by Dewis; among the co-owners was Robert McLellan, the ship's first captain.|$|E

In October 1929, the Los Angeles Times reported on a shipment that included 2,500 to 3,000 radio sets among Pennsylvanians [...] of cargo. In March 1938, The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pennsylvanians captain, C. M.

2500|$|Webb's clipper designs [...] "employed {{the most}} judicious use of timber {{of all the}} major shipbuilders." [...] For the Challenge, Webb relied on the <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> as an {{integral}} part of the ship's structural strength, and increased the width between frames at the bow and stern of the ship, thus using four fewer frames for a 200ft. hull, saving about 25,000lbs.|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 1907, {{at about}} 10:15a.m. {{en route to}} The Dalles, at about Washougal, Washington, the Gatzert struck {{the upper end of}} Ough Reef, {{breaking}} some of the <b>hull</b> <b>planking.</b> [...] The Gatzert was beached, a temporary patch put on the hole, and then returned to Portland, where the vessel was hauled out into drydock for repairs.

50|$|Traditional {{caulking}} {{was made}} from combining the fibers of cotton and oakum, a type of hemp rope fiber soaked in pine tar. The sticky caulk mixture would be driven into a wedge-shaped seam between the wooden boat <b>hull</b> <b>planks,</b> with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a caulking iron to create a watertight seal.|$|R
50|$|Valkyrie III, a keel cutter, was {{designed}} by George Lennox Watson and built at the D&W Henderson on the River Clyde in 1894-1895 for a syndicate including Lord Londsale, Lord Wolverton, Captain Henry McCalmont and headed by Lord Dunraven of the Royal Yacht Squadron.Valkyrie III had a steel frame, a <b>hull</b> <b>planked</b> with American elm and teak, and a pine deck.|$|R
50|$|The next stage, the {{conservation}} of the timbers, which began later in 2008, involved immersing the timbers in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for an extended period. Before this began, some of the timbers required treatment with triammonium citrate to remove residual iron residues in the nail holes of the outer <b>hull</b> <b>planking.</b> This unexpected additional phase added no more than between fifteen and eighteen months to the project.|$|E
50|$|The hullform is {{designed}} for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker-built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun-shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and spinnaker poles.|$|E
50|$|Remains of hull planks {{showed that}} the ship was made of elm, a wood often used by the Romans in their ships. Eventually in 1964 {{a sample of the}} <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> was carbon dated, and {{delivered}} a calibrated calendar date of 220 BC ± 43 years. The disparity in the calibrated radiocarbon date and the expected date based on the ceramics and coins was explained by the sample plank originating from an old tree cut much earlier than the ship's sinking event.|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{constructed}} around a [...] long keel of [...] thickness, which {{is believed to}} have survived intact.

5000|$|The [...] "Augusta" [...] was moored at Palacios, Texas in {{the mid-1950s}} when damaged during a storm and sunk at the pier.

5000|$|The “La Giraglia” was a {{medium-sized}} ship, but possessed a few rather unusual characteristics because the discovery and {{study of the}} twenty-six frames reveal that 58.8% of the preserved hull was composed of oak. The use of oak solely for the <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> has never before {{been seen in the}} Mediterranean. However, given the fragmented nature of the remaining wreck, this preponderance of oak in the surviving portions may not reflect the composition {{of the rest of the}} original ship. It could have perhaps only been used for the bottom of the hull, which would certainly be an interesting characteristic for such cistern boats. The ship builder might have thought it necessary to use this hardwood because the weight of the cargo was concentrated in the center section of the ship. Overall, there were six species of wood used in the construction of the “La Giraglia”: oak was used for the frames and tenons, beech and elm also for the frames, ash made up the small pegs used in the <b>hull</b> <b>planking,</b> and fir and two other types of oak. The shipwright obviously knew how to use the available species appropriately for the construction of the different structures and elements of the ship.|$|E

5000|$|The Knarr (plural Knarrer) is a Bermuda rigged, long keeled, {{sailing yacht}} {{designed}} in 1943 by Norwegian Erling L. Kristofersen.

In March 1938, The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pennsylvanians captain, C. M.

50|$|The weakest {{part of an}} {{enlarged}} hulk would be its stem and stern. Since it has no proper keel or substantial stem or stern posts {{those parts of the}} boat would have to be reinforced by the introduction of substantial aprons and breasthooks, perhaps augmented by sacrificial stem and stern posts between which the unsupported <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> could be sandwiched. Early hulks, like all of the other northern boat types, were initially shell-built using lapstrake or clinker planking which was subsequently reinforced by the insertion of grown crooks of timber as frames. Using these techniques, perhaps better understood as a result of technological transfers from architectural woodworking, shipwrights were able to extend the hulk in size until it rivaled and surpassed the cog.|$|E

25|$|After six weeks, the Sparrow-Hawk {{reached the}} coast of Massachusetts, and was wrecked at Potanumaquut Harbor Cape Cod. Upon {{reaching}} Cape Cod, the Sparrow-Hawk no longer had fresh water or 'beer'. Captain Johnston was in his cabin, sick and lame with scurvy. At night, the Sparrow-Hawk hit a sand bar but the water was smooth and she laid out an anchor. The morning revealed that the caulking between <b>hull</b> <b>planks</b> - Oakum - had been driven out. High winds drove the Sparrow-Hawk over the bar and into the Harbor. Many goods were rescued and no lives were lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{limitations}} of wood plank construction, {{the desire to}} maximize cargo volume, {{and the quest for}} fast, easy hull building led to a new type of construction method unique to chined hulls. This new method used wooden supports placed along the chines called chine logs to provide strength where the chines joined. Beams are then attached to the chine log to support planks running parallel to the chine, while cross-planked sections such as a typical scow bottom may be attached directly to the chine log. This method of construction originated with the sailing scow and continues to be used today, primarily in home built boats. Use of a chine log provides some structural support, but most chine log hulls are primarily monocoque in nature, with the <b>hull</b> <b>planking</b> itself bearing most of the structural load.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of wood {{are used in the}} construction of the Luna. White Oak is a strong, dense wood used for outboard <b>hull</b> <b>planking,</b> pilothouse planking, keels and keelsons, hull structure and frames, and knees to connect right angles. Cypress is a highly rot-resistant wood used for main deckhouse planking, boat deck (also called the [...] "Texas") and pilothouse decking, and bulwark planking (original). It is being replaced by cedar during restoration. Douglas Fir is a straight-grained and strong wood used for main deck planking, and fore and aft masts. Live Yellow Pine is rot-resistant and flexible; it is used for inboard hull [...] "ceiling" [...] planking, deck beams, deckhouse coamings, and deckhouse studs. Locust is a tough wood that expands. It is used for wooden treenails, also called trunnels, to fasten wooden planks to frames in drilled holes.|$|E
50|$|During {{the age of}} sail the ship's boats {{of larger}} ships of the line would be stowed upon the deck, {{sometimes}} nested one atop the other. Boats would be deployed and recovered by davits with some vessels carrying a single small boat suspended astern. In the smallest vessels a ship's boat was also on occasion towed astern. Boats stored on deck in tropical climates were usually partially filled with water to prevent the wooden <b>hull</b> <b>planks</b> drying out and shrinking, which would make the boat leak once it was placed in water until the wood swelled up again.|$|R
