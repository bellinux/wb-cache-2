40|$|Abstract. The interrelationship of {{equatorial}} {{and planetary}} scale ionospheric horizontal currents on quiet days is studied {{by means of}} a global <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> dynamo simulation. This simulation aims at reproducing magnetic and radar data first for a normal quiet day, and then for the strong counterelectrojet event of January 21, 1977, which was previously studied in detail on the basis of coherent backscatter radar data for the Addis-Ababa location. For the reference quiet day (January 27, 1977), the pattern of low and middle latitude currents and electric fields can be roughly reproduced by a combination of the (1,- 2) and (2, 2) solar tides. Both the Sq current system, and the global electrostatic potential distribution as derived by Richmond et al. [1980] from incoherent scatter dat...|$|E
30|$|Various {{electrical}} currents {{flow in the}} Earth’s ionosphere. At mid- and low latitudes, thermospheric {{winds and}} tides generate electrical currents in the E-region, around 110 km altitude, through {{a process known as}} the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> dynamo (Richmond and Thayer 2000). These currents take the form of two large-scale vortices on the day side of the Earth, one counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere and the other clockwise in the Southern hemisphere. They generate magnetic fields that can be sensed on the ground, where they reach a few tens of nT, and at low Earth orbit (LEO) altitudes. These are usually referred to as Sq magnetic fields. Along the geomagnetic dip equator, a local enhancement of the electrical conductivity leads to a more intense current, the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) and magnetic fields that can reach more than 100  nT on the ground (Forbes 1981).|$|E
40|$|Solutions {{are given}} for the {{diffusion}} of trapped particles in a planetary magnetic field in which {{the first and second}} adiabatic invariants are preserved but the third is not, using as boundary conditions a fixed density at the outer boundary (the magnetopause) and a zero density at an inner boundary (the planetary surface). Losses to an orbiting natural satellite are included and an approximate evaluation is made {{of the effects of the}} synchrotron radiation on the energy of relativistic electrons. Choosing parameters appropriate to Jupiter, the electrons required to produce the observed synchrotron radiation are explained. If a speculative mechanism in which the diffusion is driven by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> is the true explanation of the electrons producing the synchrotron emission it can be concluded that Jupiter's inner magnetosphere is occupied by an energetic proton flux that would be a serious hazard to spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} for {{the electric}} current in the polar ionosphere {{have been made}} by assuming some realistic distributions of the electric field and conductivity. Two dynamo actions are taken into account; one of which is induced by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> and the other by the solar wind. For the solar wind dynamo action, it is found that the secondary polarization field caused by nonuniform distribution of ionospheric conductivity is much larger than the primary field induced by the solar wind, suggesting its important effect on charged particles in the magnetosphere, and that the irrotational current having a source and sink is of the same order of magnitude as the solenoidal current closing its circuit in the ionosphere. It is also found that the solar wind is, in general, more effective than the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> in producing polar current systems such as DP 1 and 2, but in some cases the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> {{have a significant effect on}} the current distribution...|$|R
50|$|On March 2014, {{a pattern}} {{resembling}} 'zebra stripes' {{was observed in}} the radiation belts by the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment (RBSPICE) onboard Van Allen Probes. The reason reported was that due to the tilt in Earth's magnetic field axis, the planet’s rotation generated an oscillating, weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt. It was later demonstrated that the zebra stripes were in fact an imprint of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> on radiation belts.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model describing radial diffusion, with {{violation of the}} third adiabatic invariant and with local losses, {{is applied to the}} Pioneer 10 and 11 observations of omnidirectional integral intensities of electrons with energy exceeding 21 MeV. Local losses outside L = 3 are much stronger than synchrotron losses but weaker than the losses one would expect for strong pitch angle diffusion. If radial diffusion is driven by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds,</b> as was suggested by Brice and McDonough (1973), it is found that the theoretical solution which best fits the data requires that the radial diffusion coefficient equals 3 x 10 to the - 9 th L-cubed/s and the lifetime against local losses is approximately a few million seconds...|$|R
40|$|The column {{heating rate}} of the dayside Venus ionospheric ion gas {{resulting}} from transfer of energy from the hot oxygen component of the neutral atmosphere is estimated and found equal to that which, when inserted into ionospheric models at the ionopause, raises the calculated temperature to measured values. The transfer of energy is effected through resonant charge exchange between the relatively cold ionospheric O(+) ions and the hot oxygen neutrals. The hot oxygen density in the nightside hemisphere {{does not appear to}} {{play a significant role in}} the nightside ion energetics. The hot oxygen neutral gas flowing across the terminator from its dayside source to its nightside sink will exchange momentum with the antisunward flowing ionospheric gas. Although the flow rate of hot oxygen can be estimated only crudely, the estimated rate of deposition and absorption is comparable to that produced by the plasma pressure and should be included in numerical studies of the terminator <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind...</b>|$|E
40|$|The interannual {{variation}} of the ionospheric solar quiet (Sq) current system is examined. A dense magnetometer network over Japan enables the accurate determination of the central position of the northern Sq current loop or the Sq current focus, during 1999 – 2015. It is found that the Sq focus latitude undergoes an interannual {{variation of}} ± 2 ° with a period of approximately 28 months, similar to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropical lower stratosphere. The QBO-like variation of Sq is particularly evident during 2005 – 2013. No corresponding interannual variability is found in solar extreme ultraviolet radiation. Comparisons with tidal winds, derived from a whole-atmosphere model, reveal that the QBO-like {{variation of the}} Sq current focus is highly correlated with the amplitude variations of migrating and nonmigrating diurnal tides in the lower thermosphere. The {{results suggest that the}} stratospheric QBO can influence the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> dynamo through the QBO modulation of tides...|$|E
30|$|About periods M 1 /M 2, for {{the morning}} sector (Figs.  6, 7), IRI still models an {{equatorial}} pattern characterized by a maximum centered on the magnetic equator, while Swarm measures a double-crest pattern in the west longitude sector of the globe, that is unusual for these local times. In fact, at these local times, the zonal electric field is westward and {{gives rise to a}} reverse fountain causing an increase of electron density around the magnetic equator, according to the mechanism proposed by Balan and Bailey (1995). The double-crest pattern measured by Swarm can be ascribed to an early fountain effect caused by ionospheric electric fields and currents that at low and mid-latitudes, during geomagnetic disturbed periods, can significantly differ from their quiet-day patterns, due to a concurrent action of two mechanisms: the magnetospheric dynamo and the ionospheric disturbance dynamo (Blanc and Richmond 1980). Dynamic interactions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere are the source of the magnetospheric dynamo. This gives rise to electrical currents which, along with their associated electric fields [called penetrating interplanetary electric fields (IEFs)], can penetrate to lower latitudes through the conducting ionosphere (Fejer and Scherliess 1995; Fejer et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2008). The second mechanism is instead generated by an energy input to the thermosphere that alters the global thermospheric circulation, modifying the electric fields and currents that are generated by the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> dynamo action during quiet conditions at low and mid-latitudes (Fejer et al. 2008; Nicolls et al. 2006).|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{indication}} {{of interaction between}} the stratosphere and mesosphere makes it seem probable that effects from the lower atmosphere will not be uncommon among the variations of the earth’s magnetic field especially in the form and range of the daily variation of the field. Meteorology {{may be able to}} aid space research by identifying effects in the magnetic records that may be of atmospheric origin in order that they not be mistaken for direct solar effects. Extending the work of two earlier articles this paper gives the daily variation of the horizontal intensity of the earth’s field for San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the quiet-day average for the 11 years 1948 - 58 in a form which illustrates seasonal features that the author believes arise from prevailing <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds.</b> Further, semi-monthly individual 5 -day averages of the daily variation are given for San Juan a for period of 12 months in 1957 - 58 for which a description of the stratospheric circulation at roughly 30 km. altitude (10 mb.) was available. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe interrelationship of {{equatorial}} {{and planetary}} scale ionospheric horizontal currents on quiet days is studied {{by means of}} a global <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind</b> dynamo simulation. This simulation aims at reproducing magnetic and radar data first for a normal quiet day, and then for the strong counterelectrojet event of January 21, 1977, which was previously studied in detail on the basis of coherent backscatter radar data for the Addis-Ababa location. For the reference quiet day (January 27, 1977), the pattern of low and middle latitude currents and electric fields can be roughly reproduced by a combination of the (1,- 2) and (2, 2) solar tides. Both the Sq current system, and the global electrostatic potential distribution as derived by Richmond et al. [1980] from incoherent scatter data are well simulated. Direct comparison of the computed electric field with the quiet-day averages available for each radar site also show an excellent agreement on the east-west component, but a poorer one on the northsouth component. The counterelectrojet simulation is performed by fitting the H component trace at the magnetic equator and the D trace at midlatitudes. The result appears to give a consistent {{solution to the problem of}} the electrical connection between the equatorial counterelectrojet and the planetary dynamo layer. Two horizontal current vortices of opposite directions are found to flow at low latitudes on each side of the noon sector, anticlockwise in the morning and clockwise in the afternoon. They both produce a poleward current flow at low latitudes at noon, a feature that is detected on the magnetic records. The counterelectrojet event is reproduced by a combination of the (2, 2) and (2,#) solar tides, assuming that the contribution of the diurnal tide to the altitudeintegrated current flow cancels out. This result is in agreement with a previous simulation study of the counterelectrojet phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Most of Titan's {{atmospheric}} {{organic and}} nitrogen chemistry, aerosol formation, and atmospheric loss are driven from external energy {{sources such as}} Solar UV, Saturn's magnetosphere, solar wind and galactic cosmic rays. The Solar UV tends to dominate the energy input at lower altitudes of approximately 1100 km but which can extend down to approximately 400 km, while the plasma interaction from Saturn's magnetosphere, Saturn's magnetosheath or solar wind are more important at higher altitudes of approximately 1400 km, but the heavy ion plasma [O(+) ] of approximately 2 keV and energetic ions [H(+) ] of approximately 30 keV or higher from Saturn's magnetosphere can penetrate below 950 km. Cosmic rays with energies of greater than 1 GeV can penetrate much deeper into Titan's atmosphere with most of its energy deposited at approximately 100 km altitude. The haze layer tends to dominate between 100 km and 300 km. The induced magnetic field from Titan's interaction with the external plasma can be very complex and will tend to channel the flow of energy into Titan's upper atmosphere. Cassini observations combined with advanced hybrid simulations of the plasma interaction with Titan's upper atmosphere show {{significant changes in the}} character of the interaction with Saturn local time at Titan's orbit where the magnetosphere displays large and systematic changes with local time. The external solar wind can also drive sub-storms within the magnetosphere which can then modify the magnetospheric interaction with Titan. Another important parameter is solar zenith angle (SZA) with respect to the co-rotation direction of the magnetospheric flow. Titan's interaction can contribute to atmospheric loss via pickup ion loss, scavenging of Titan's ionospheric plasma, loss of ionospheric plasma down its induced magnetotail via an <b>ionospheric</b> <b>wind,</b> and non-thermal loss of the atmosphere via heating and sputtering induced by the bombardment of magnetospheric keV ions and electrons. This energy input evidently drives the large positive and negative ions observed below approximately 1100 km altitude with ion masses exceeding 10, 000 daltons. We refer to these ions as seed particles for the aerosols observed below 300 km altitude. These seed particles can be formed, for example, from the polymerization of acetylene (C 2 H 2) and benzene (C 6 H 6) molecules in Titan's upper atmosphere to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and/or fullerenes (C 60). In the case of fullerenes, which are hollow spherical carbon shells, magnetospheric keV [O(+) ] ions can become trapped inside the fullerenes and eventually find themselves inside the aerosols as free oxygen. The aerosols are then expected to fall to Titan's surface as polymerized hydrocarbons with trapped free oxygen where unknown surface chemistry can take place...|$|E
40|$|Fluxes of {{electrons}} and protons in Jupiter's radiation belts are calculated with the source (radial diffusion inward from the solar wind) {{and the loss}} (synchroton radiation). The calculations are tested against the measured radio-wave wavelength distribution, the radio-wave distribution with distance from Jupiter, {{and the degree of}} polarization of the radio waves. The Fokker-Planck equation is solved by using the method of Farley and Walt (1971) with the fixed flux at the outer boundary and the zero flux at Jupiter's surface. It is found, in agreement with Brice and McDonough (1973), Jacques and Davis (1973), and Birmingham et al. (1974), that the usual magnetic and electric diffusions, which vary as L to the 10 th power and L to the 6 th power, respectively, are insufficient to furnish the required electrons and that the diffusion driven by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> of Brice and McDonough is strong enough to furnish Jupiter's belts. An additional loss mechanism close to Jupiter is required to remove the electrons, particularly those at low energies...|$|R

We are all familiar with the twinkling of visible stars and my task was to understand why radio stars also twinkled. I was fortunate to have been taught by Ratcliffe, who first showed me the power of Fourier techniques in dealing with such diffraction phenomena. By a modest extension of existing theory I was able to show that our radio stars twinkled because of plasma clouds in the ionosphere at heights around 300 km, and I was also able to measure the speed of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> in this region (1). My fascination in using extra-terrestrial radio sources for studying the intervening plasma next brought me to the solar corona.

30|$|Most {{smooth and}} regular {{variations}} recorded on magnetograms during magnetically quiet days {{are known as}} solar quiet daily variations or simply Sq (Campbell 1989). These types of variations were first observed by Graham (1724). The major driving force for quiet day variations are due to X-rays (1 – 170 A°) and extreme ultraviolet rays (170 – 1750 A°) from the Sun that ionizes the upper atmosphere (known as ionosphere). These ionized gases known as plasma are forced to move across the Earth’s main magnetic field producing electromagnetic forces (EMFs). This EMF drives electric currents in the conducting E-region (ionospheric dynamo) giving rise to daily variations in magnetic field observed at magnetic observatories (Chapman and Bartels 1940). The observed quiet day variations at the ground {{is a result of}} several parameters like <b>ionospheric</b> conductivity, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds,</b> geomagnetic field configuration, etc. and the ionospheric dynamo is not the only source of these Sq variations but some contributions from magnetospheric origin is also present in this Sq field (Olson 1970). At least two other magnetospheric current systems, the neutral sheet and ring currents, may also make contributions to the quiet magnetic variations at the surface of the Earth (Olsen 1996).|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Thomsen et al., 1977), a technique was proposed for estimating the radial diffusion coefficient (n) {{in the inner}} magnetosphere of Jupiter from the observations of the sweeping effect of the inner Jovian satellites on the fluxes of the energetic charged particles. The present paper extends this technique to permit the unique identification of the parameters D sub O and n, where the diffusion coefficient {{is assumed to be}} of the form D = D sub O L to the nth. The derived value of D sub O depends directly on assumptions regarding the nature and efficiency of the loss mechanism operating on the particles, while the value of n depends only on the assumed width of the loss region. The extended technique is applied to the University of Iowa Pioneer 11 proton data, leading to values of n of about O and D(6) of about 3 x 10 to the - 8 th (R sub J) -squared/sec, when satellite sweepup losses are assumed to be the only loss operating on the protons. The small value of n is strong evidence that the radial diffusion is driven by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Total ionospheric Joule heating {{variations}} {{have been}} studied with special focus {{on the effect of}} <b>ionospheric</b> neutral <b>winds.</b> Electric field data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) have been combined with models for the neutral <b>wind,</b> <b>ionospheric</b> Pedersen conductivity and magnetic field to calculate two Joule heating components; the convection heating and wind correction terms. Due to the motion of a dusk-side neutral wind cell, semi-diurnal variations in the wind correction are shown to reduce heating at some universal times, whilst enhancing it at others. This means that the wind correction propagates into the total Joule heating, transforming the usual diurnal trend due to day-night conductivity changes into a semi-diurnal double peak, which becomes increasingly prominent at higher levels of geomagnetic activity. We show that there are significant contributions from the wind correction term across all seasons and activity levels which act to consistently modify Joule heating from that deduced using ion convection alone...|$|R

40|$|High-latitude ionospheric currents, plasma temperatures, densities, and {{composition}} are all {{affected by the}} time-dependent response of the neutral thermosphere to ion drag and Joule heating {{through a variety of}} complex feedback processes. These processes can best be studied numerically using the appropriate nonlinear numerical modeling techniques in conjunction with experimental case studies. In particular, the basic physics of these processes can be understood using a model, and these concepts can then be applied to more complex realistic situations by developing the appropriate simulations of real events. Finally, these model results can be compared with satellite-derived data from the thermosphere. We used numerical simulations from the National Center of Atmospheric Research Thermosphere/Ionosphere General Circulation Model (NCAR TIGCM) and data from the Dynamic Explorer 2 (DE 2) satellite to study the time-dependent effects of the inertia of the neutral thermosphere on ionospheric currents, plasma temperatures, densities, {{and composition}}. One particular case of these inertial effects is the so-called 'fly-wheel effect'. This effect occurs when the neutral gas, that has been spun-up by the large <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds</b> associated with a geomagnetic storm, moves faster than the ions in the period {{after the end of the}} main phase of the storm.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{production}} and loss of energetic electrons in Jupiter's radiation belt is presented. It is postulated that the electrons originate in the solar wind and are diffused in toward the planet by perturbations which violate the particles' third adiabatic invariant. At large distances, magnetic perturbations, electric fields associated with magnetospheric convection, or interchange instabilities driven by thermal plasma gradients may drive the diffusion. Inside about 10 Jupiter radii, the diffusion is probably driven by electric fields associated with the upper atmosphere dynamo which is driven by neutral winds in the ionosphere. The diurnal component of the dynamo wind fields produces a dawn-dusk asymmetry in the decimetric radiation from the electrons in the belts, {{and the lack of}} obvious measured asymmetries in the decimetric radiation measurements provides estimates of upper limits for these Jovian <b>ionospheric</b> neutral <b>winds...</b>|$|R

In particular, during the M 1 period, two crests of electron density well beyond the magnetic parallels at 30 ° and − 30 ° are observed in the Atlantic Ocean sector, suggesting also the occurrence of a “super-fountain effect” (Balan et al. 2010; Zong et al. 2010).

40|$|Pulsed radars have an {{ambiguous}} relationship between range and velocity which {{is proportional to}} the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), leading to potential tradeoffs. High PRFs are necessary to avoid velocity aliasing but suffer at the expense of unambiguous range. Obscuration due to ambiguous range foldover from distant clutter echos seriously degrades target detectability. For the case of skywave HF over-the-horizon (OTH) radar, ionospheric motion causes spreading of surface clutter in Doppler space and coupled with range folded clutter, introduces the effect of so-called 'separated' spread Doppler clutter (SDC). Selection of a nonrecurrent waveform (NRWF) with a quadratic phase interpulse code has been shown to mitigate long-range SDC by folding the multi-hop returns into known disassociated Doppler regions. Utilizing multiple receive elements, spatial processing can be preformed to exploit the correlation between spatial frequency and Doppler shift produced by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>winds.</b> Adaptive beamforming is known to provide asymptotically optimal array gain if sufficient training data is available. In highly nonstationary environments however, obtaining this asymptotic performance is difficult as neither knowledge of the target wavefront nor signal-free training data is easily obtainable for training. A blind adaptive spatial processing (BASP) technique has been proposed, combining minimum variance (MV) adaptive beamforming and blind source separation (BSS). The unique idea of BASP is the formulation of a signal-free covariance matrix from BSS clutter and noise components at a single range bin, and utilizing it in adaptive beamforming to suppress clutter. This research explores a clutter mitigation method that will combine NRWF and BASP in order to recover targets masked by Doppler-spread surface backscatter from points beyond the radar's maximum unambiguous range while maintaining target detectability elsewhere in Doppler. Current methods for mitigating range-folded clutter, such as reducing the pulse-repetition frequency or the use of non-recurrent waveforms, suffer loss in the usable Doppler space available for target detection or a reduction in target revisit rate. The proposed research uses BSS methods to exploit the known Doppler separation afforded by NRWF in order to estimate the spatial wavefront of the clutter across a linear receive array. Spatial adaptive processing using this estimated wavefront is then used to suppress range-folded clutter at each range bin without sacrificing the radar timeline or usable Doppler space. Simulation is conducted to understand the NRWF and its ability to separate range-folded clutter in Doppler. The BASP method is applied to the NRWF and its results demonstrate performance improvement in terms of achievable signal-to-clutter and noise ratio gain. Laboratory experimental results show the NRWF's ability to separate range-folded clutter into designed Doppler regions. BASP is then applied and demonstrated to mitigate the separated range folded clutter and recover usable Doppler space. Dissertatio...|$|R

The dependence of the IAR eigenfrequencies and damping rates on the perpendicular wave number {{and on the ground}} conductivity during the day- and nighttime conditions is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In order to demonstrate the IAR excitation by neutral winds the power spectra of the geomagnetic perturbation on the ground surface are calculated. Furthermore, it is found that Kolmogorov spectra of the <b>ionospheric</b> turbulent neutral <b>winds</b> and the IAR eigenfrequencies lie in the same frequency range that make it possible to enhance the IAR excitation. The relevance of the developed theoretical model to the ground-based observations is stressed...|$|R
40|$|We reexamined the {{processes}} leading to saturation {{of the electric}} field, transmitted into the Earth's ionosphere from the solar wind, incorporating features of the coupled system previously ignored. We took into account that the electric field is transmitted into the ionosphere through a region of open field lines, and that the ionospheric conductivity in the polar cap and auroral zone may be different. Penetration of the electric field into the magnetosphere is linked with the generation of the Alfven wave, going out from the ionosphere into the solar wind and being coupled with the field-aligned currents at the boundary of the open field limes. The electric field of the outgoing Alfven wave reduces the original electric field and provides the saturation effect in the electric field and currents during strong geomagnetic disturbances, associated with increasing ionospheric conductivity. The electric field and field-aligned currents of this Alfven wave are dependent on the <b>ionospheric</b> and solar <b>wind</b> parameters and may significantly affect the electric field and field-aligned currents, generated in the polar ionosphere. Estimating {{the magnitude of the}} saturation effect in the electric field and field-aligned currents allows us to improve the correlation between solar wind parameters and resulting disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere...|$|R
40|$|Plasmaspheric {{refilling}} on an L = 4 {{flux tube}} was studied {{by using a}} time-dependent, hydrodynamic plasmaspheric flow model in which the ion streams from the two hemispheres are treated as distinct fluids. In the model the continuity, momentum, and energy equations of a two-ion (O(+) and H(+)), quasi-neutral, currentless plasma are solved along a closed geomagnetic field line; diffusive equilibrium is not assumed. collisions between all stream pairs and with neutral species are included. The model includes a corotating, tilted dipole magnetic field and neutral <b>winds.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> sources and sinks are accounted for in a self-consistent manner. Electrons {{are assumed to be}} heated by photoelectrons. The model flux tube extends from a 200 -km altitude in one hemisphere to a 200 -km altitude in the other hemisphere. Initially, the upwelling streams pass through each other practically unimpeded. When the streams approach the boundary in the conjugate ionosphere, a shock develops there, which moves upward and dissipates slowly; {{at about the same time}} a reverse shock develops in the hemisphere of origin, which moves upward. After about 1 hour, large shocks develop in each stream near the equator; these shocks move toward the equator and downward after crossing the equator. However, these shocks are probably artificial, because counterstreaming flows occur in each H(+) fluid, which the model can only handle by creating shocks...|$|R
