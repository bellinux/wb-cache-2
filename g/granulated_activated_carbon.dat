The process utilizes <b>granulated</b> <b>activate</b> <b>carbon</b> (GAC) as its water filtration. The microbial (bacterial) colonization is possible over the GAC media particles form ‘biofilm’ (Scholz and Martin 1997). Actually, it {{is described as}} a ‘porous tangled mass of slime matrix (Weber et al. 1978). It consists of microbial cells, either immobilized {{on the surface of the}} GAC (substratum) or embedded in an extracellular microbial organic polymer matrix (Ghosh et al. 1999; Lawrence and Tong 2005). Bacteria and fungi cells in the biofilms secrete extracellular polymeric substances to form a cohesive, stable matrix in which cells are held in dense agglomeration (Branda et al. 2005; Lazarova and Manem 1995). The extracellular matrix is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids (Goodwin and Forster 1985). The activity of the biofilm relates to the physiological modifications associated with the promotion of certain genes (Dagostino et al. 1991), or changes the bacteria cell surrounding to increase the local concentration of nutrients, oxygen and enzymes (Ghosh et al. 1999) or limit the invasion of toxic or inhibiting substances (Blenkinsopp and Costerton 1991).|$|R
