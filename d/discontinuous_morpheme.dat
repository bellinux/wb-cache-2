The Laragia concord is shown by a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morpheme</b> - at least in many cases, but not in the verb - partly prefixal and partly suffixal.|$|E

Extraction properties also renew in some sense the adverbial original caracter of the genitive case. These extensions and différenciations of grammaticalized values take place inside two syntactic uses of de. De can occur as a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morpheme</b> of a noun operator where it is grammaticalized inside the argumentai relationship of this noun with its arguments. De can also occur as a lexical operator, expressing various concrete and abstract possessive values and governing arguments, having or not argumentai structures. Daladier Anne.

The semantic factor is concluded to be a distinctive feature and, since language is form, as a consequence Semantics can be expressed by means of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morphemes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Harris's {{contributions}} to linguistics as of about 1945 {{as summarized in}} Methods in Structural Linguistics (Harris 1951) include componential analysis of long components in phonology, componential analysis of morphology, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morphemes,</b> and a substitution-grammar of word- and phrase-expansions that is related to immediate-constituent analysis, but without its limitations. With its manuscript date of January 1946, the book has been recognized as including the first formulation {{of the notion of}} a generative grammar.|$|R

That said, Israeli Hebrew is much more analytic than (Biblical/Mishnaic) Hebrew. For example, whereas the ancient Hebrew phrase for [...] "my grandfather" [...] was sav-í [...] "grandfather-1stPerson.Singular.Possessive", in Israeli Hebrew it is sába shelí [...] "grandfather of-me".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Israeli is {{currently}} {{one of the}} official languages of the State of Israel. It is a fusional synthetic language, with non-concatenative <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morphemes</b> realised by vowel infixation. This typological paper demonstrates {{that there is a}} clear distinc-tion in Israeli between direct and indirect speech. The indirect speech report, which is a subset of complement clauses, is characterized by a shift in person, spatial and temporal deixis. However, unlike in English, the verbs usually do not undergo a tense shift. Israeli has various lexicalized direct speech reports. By and large, Israeli re-ported speech constructions reflect Yiddish and Standard Average European patterns, often enhancing a suitable pre-existent Hebrew construction...|$|R
40|$|Hebrew’ {{is one of}} the {{official}} languages – with Arabic and English – of the State of Israel, established in 1948 on 20, 770 km 2 in the ‘Middle’ East. Israeli emerged {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Its symbolic first native speaker, Itamar Ben-ehuda, began speaking in 1886. Israeli is a fusional synthetic language, with non-concatenative <b>discontinuous</b> <b>morphemes</b> realised by vowel infixation. This typological paper demonstrates that the typical Israeli comparative construction involves a copula or verbless clause construction, with the ‘Parameter’ as copula complement (CC) or as a verbless clause complement (VCC). However, there is another mono-clausal comparative construction, in which the ‘Index’ of comparison is the main verb in an extended intransitive clause. Future research would demonstrate that Israeli comparatives correspond with Yiddish and ‘Standard Average European’, although the forms used are Hebrew. Ghil'ad Zuckerman...|$|R
40|$|Description of the Tanacross Athabaskan {{language}} of Alaska. This dissertation presents a linguistic {{description of the}} phonology and morphology of Tanacross Athabaskan, an endangered language spoken by approximately sixty persons in eastern interior Alaska. There is little extant documentation of Tanacross; hence, this description is based primarily on data gathered from first-hand field work. [...] [...] Tanacross {{is typical of the}} Athabaskan family in its typological characteristics. There is a relatively small phonemic inventory, and most of the phonemic contrasts are neutralized outside the stem-syllable onset position. The lexicon is relatively small, consisting of perhaps six thousand distinct morphemes. Noun morphology is relatively straightforward, with few active morphological processes. In contrast, verb structure is extremely complex, consisting of a possibly <b>discontinuous</b> root <b>morpheme</b> together with a string of inflectional and derivational affixes which combine via an elaborate system of non- concatenative templatic morphology. The verb word may stand alone as entire utterance. Members of other minor word classes tend to be monomorphemic. [...] [...] Tanacross exhibits several unique properties which distinguish it from neighboring Athabaskan languages and invite further study. Tanacross is unique among the Alaska Athabaskan languages in having high tone as the reflex of Proto-Athabaskan constriction. In addition, more than any other tonal language in Alaska Tanacross has preserved segmental information lost via apocope through an elaborate system of compound tone. Tanacross also has many unique phonetic features, including the loss of suffix vowels and the devoicing of stem-initial fricatives. Tanacross morphology reflects its transitional status between the (historically) conservative languages of the lower Tanana river and the innovative languages of the Tanana and Yukon uplands...|$|R
