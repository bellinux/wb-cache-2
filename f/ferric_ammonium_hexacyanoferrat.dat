The levels of receptor were reduced by at least 50 and 35 % of that of the control in cells treated with diferric Tf and <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> citrate, respectively. These changes were of total cellular receptors with no alteration {{in the proportion of}} receptors found on the cell surface. The half-lives of the receptor were identical in cells treated with desferrioxamine, diferric Tf, or <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> citrate. Cells metabolically labeled with [35 S]methionine showed a 2. 5 -fold increase in the rate of receptor synthesis when treated with desferrioxamine and a 35 and 65 % decrease when treated with <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> citrate and diferric Tf, respectively. In vitro translations of polyadenylated mRNA isolated from cells incubated with desferrioxamine showed a 2. 5 -fold increase in translatable mRNA for the receptor, whereas treatment of cells with <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> citrate and diferric Tf resulted in a 25 and 50 % reduction, respectively, in translatable mRNA for this receptor...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, {{which has}} {{advantages}} over ferric chloride {{in that it}} is not deliquescent and does not evolve hydrogen chloride upon addition of sulfuric acid, was used in the ferric chloride-sulfuric acid method for serum cholesterol determination. Comparable results are obtained with these iron salts. To determine cholesterolin biologicalfluids,use of the ferric chloride-sulfuric acid reagent introduced by Zlatkis et al. (1) is relatively simple and reliable (2, 3), and the sensitivityof the reagent for cholesterol is four to five times greater than that of the Liebermann-Burchard re-agent (2). However, Parekh and Jung (4) reported that hydrogen chloride is evolved during the ferric chloride-sulfuric acid reaction,leading to poor control of reaction temperature. In addition, the very deliquescent ferric chloride is tedious to handle. The ferricchloride-sulfuricacid method would thus be better if a nondeliquescent iron saltcould be sub-stituted that forms no volatile compounds on reaction with sulfuric acid.

The sera from normal guinea pigs were consistently fungistatic for Rhizopus oryzae. The sera from normal guinea pigs were consistently fungistatic for both T. mentagrophytes and R. oryzae.

40|$|A novel {{extracellular}} mycobacterial enzyme {{was identified}} in the ruminant pathogen Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.

The purified reductase had a calculated Mr of 17, 000, was sensitive to proteinase K treatment, and had an isoelectric point of pH 9. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed glycine, serine, asparagine (or aspartic acid), and glutamine (or glutamic acid) as the most frequently occurring residues.
