500|$|In April 2015, the United Nations {{appointed}} Craig {{the first}} global {{advocate for the}} elimination of mines and explosive hazards. The role involves raising awareness for the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS), and political and financial support for the cause. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Craig: [...] "You have been given a licence to kill, I'm now <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> licence to save." ...|$|E
500|$|Evan Ross Katz from Mic {{described}} the video as a [...] "highly spiritual journey" [...] {{like some of}} the singer's previous clips. Justin Harp from Digital Spy {{described the}} clip as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "poignant", adding that it [...] "highlights the theme of loss and ultimately redemption" [...] as enamored in the song. Bustles Shannon Carlin felt that the [...] "emotional" [...] video [...] "will make fans and non-fans look at [...] differently". Carlin compared it to the video of singer Christina Aguilera's 2002 single [...] "Beautiful", which had similar emotional and empowerment visuals, and finally added: [...] "Like Aguilera, Gaga is <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense of who she is by stripping back all that pomp and circumstance of her early years and giving fans something raw." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Benz {{initially}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy Summers, but that later went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously won the part of Cordelia Chase. Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> name and we're not going to kill you.' And he did that for a while until it finally came time to kill me, and kill me, and kill me and killed [...] me." [...] She later went on to say: ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes Lander {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} Spit : [...] "People expect us to suck, then we get on stage and blow them away." [...] The song [...] "Spit" [...] {{was inspired by the}} attitude of local bands towards Kittie. According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hard time because of who you are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many people think that the album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} convinced, with Australia's PALGN {{referring}} to the story as [...] "rather predictable and clichéd". Jonathan Parkyn of Personal Computer World wrote, [...] "Dialogue is NWN2's key component.... but those who favour fisticuffs may find it tiresome after playing for several billion hours." [...] Similarly, reception of Neverwinter Nights 2's graphics was mixed. Some reviewers referred to the visuals as [...] "new age" [...] and [...] "beautiful", but others noticed inconsistencies in their rendering and performance, especially on lower-end PCs. The Sydney Morning Herald said [...] "The detailed 3D engine allows for lush scenery, <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> greater sense of exploration as you poke around the rustic villages and murky swamps". [...] Several comments on the audio and voice acting were positive, though one reviewer expressed disappointment that some sound effects had apparently been recycled from Neverwinter Nights. [...] Conklin called the in-game camera [...] "abysmal" [...] and said the game had many graphical glitches. [...] Slagle agreed, writing, [...] "I {{had a lot of}} stuttering graphics and voiceovers that were out of synch with the characters' on-screen animations." ...|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E

2500|$|The footage {{shows that}} Encinia {{initially}} wrote a routine traffic violation warning for Bland. After {{he returns to}} her car and speaks briefly to her again, he asks her to put out her cigarette. She responds, [...] "Why do I have {{to put out a}} cigarette when I'm in my own car?" [...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her more than a dozen times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
