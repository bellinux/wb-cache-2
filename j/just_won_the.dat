5|$|Hans Rønning's {{assignment}} to officiate {{the game was}} viewed by other on-ice officials as a nod to organizers from Lillehammer, Norway, who had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> right to host the 1994 Winter Olympics and were observing the game. At age 38, Rønning expected the 1987 tournament to be among his last international assignments. Rønning never officiated another international game, though he did referee two more seasons in Norway before retiring.|$|E

She had also expressed intentions to record with Fantasia Barrino, who had then <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> series' third season; both were expected to release their albums in the same month.|$|E

Joseph {{initially}} was not popular with Red Wings fans but eventually found his form {{in the latter half}} of the 2002–03 season to backstop his team to the division title. Detroit was upset in the first round of the playoffs in 2003 by the eventual conference champions, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a four straight game sweep.|$|E

25|$|From 1905 until 1989 {{there were}} two top {{divisions}} in Cornwall; Cornwall Senior League 1 East and Cornwall Senior League 1 West. The teams finishing in first place played for the Western Morning News Cup with the winner declared champions of Cornwall. The last winners of the Western Morning Cup was St Gluvias who beat St Austell by 22 runs. In 1990 the top six clubs {{in the east and}} west leagues formed County League One with St <b>Just</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> league despite only finishing 6th in the western league the previous season. The irony of St <b>Just</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> first title was they were initially against an all Cornwall league because of the increased expenditure of travel for teams in the far west.|$|R
5|$|Daniel Scavino, {{social media}} {{director}} for Trump's presidential campaign began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to {{general manager of}} the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Republican primaries.|$|E
5|$|In September, Ofotbanen {{was one of}} six {{companies}} prequalified to bid for {{the first}} public service obligation tender on the Gjøvik Line. However, the company chose to not submit a bid, and the contract was won by the NSB subsidiary NSB Anbud. In September, the mechanical company Narvik Sentralverksted, that had provided maintenance for the Norwegian National Rail Administration in Narvik since 1999, accused the municipality of illegally subsidizing Ofotbanen through providing the company with subsidized rent for their workshops. Ofotbanen had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> public tender for the contract, and the company threatened to take the municipality to court for violation of competition laws. The matter was soon resolved, without the courts being involved. In December, the government granted permission for Ofotbanen to operate charter trains throughout the entire railway network.|$|E

25|$|The Germans <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> {{race for}} Kholm, and {{positioned}} a mixed battlegroup of around 4,500 soldiers {{under the leadership}} of Generalmajor Scherer, but the group had virtually no artillery or anti tank guns.

25|$|Later on in {{the early}} 1980s various series of stamps became popular after {{the success of the}} Flemish Tapestries issues of the late 1970s. The new issues showed Maltese ships (1982–87) or Maltese {{military}} uniforms (1987–91). The second installment of the latter issue is also important since it uses the English language, and although Maltese still continued to be used, this change might have been a result of the new Nationalist government that had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> 1987 elections. A new definitive appeared in 1991 showing natural and artistic heritage of the Maltese Islands.|$|E
25|$|Burnet, {{aided by}} Close, was {{successful}} in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At {{the end of that}} season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over. If Burnet resigned immediately, Vic Wilson could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075 led to {{civil war and}} gave the Normans an {{opportunity}} to seize lands in North Wales. In 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> throne of Gwynedd from Trahaearn ap Caradog at the Battle of Mynydd Carn was enticed to {{a meeting with the}} Earl of Chester and Earl of Shrewsbury and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans. In the south William the Conqueror advanced into Dyfed founding castles and mints at St David's and Cardiff. Rhys ap Tewdwr of Deheubarth was killed in 1093 in Brycheiniog, and his kingdom was seized and divided between various Norman lordships. The Norman conquest of Wales appeared virtually complete.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act {{replaced}} the Two TV Station rule – which had capped ownership of Metropolitan TV stations at two – with a 60% Reach rule. This would {{pave the way}} for major changes in television ownership in Australia as the three television networks expanded beyond Sydney and Melbourne, buying their affiliates in other capitals. At the time Kerry Stokes owned ADS 7 Adelaide, CTC 7 in Canberra and had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> licence for NEW 10 in Perth. Stokes had planned to buy the Seven Network from John Fairfax which would have seen CTC align with ATN 7 Sydney and HSV 7 Melbourne. Stokes offered $100 million more than rival Christopher Skase for Seven, but was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, Singaporean {{businessman}} Peter Lim {{was designated}} by the Fundación Valencia CF as the buyer of 70.4% of the shares owned by the club's foundation. After months of negotiations between Lim and Bankia (the main creditor of the club), an agreement was reached in August 2014. Juan Antonio Pizzi was unexpectedly sacked as head coach and replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo on 2 July 2014. Later, Salvo revealed {{in an interview that}} hiring Nuno was one of the conditions Lim had insisted on when buying the club. This raised eyebrows in the media because of Nuno's close relationship with the football agent Jorge Mendes, whose first-ever client was Nuno. Lim and Mendes are also close friends and business partners. Regardless, Nuno's first season was a successful one. Notable signings included Álvaro Negredo, André Gomes and Enzo Pérez, who had <b>just</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> LPFP Primeira Liga Player of the Year in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Valencia finished the 2014–15 season in fourth place for Champions League qualification with 77 points, just one point ahead of Sevilla after a dramatic final week, defeating Granada 4–0.|$|E
25|$|The last final {{of the day}} to {{be played}} on the Centre Court was the women's doubles'.

The Williams sisters proved to be as dominant through the final as they were during the whole competition, in which they lost no set and knocked out several seeded teams, among them French Open champions Anabel Medina Garrigues & Virginia Ruano Pascual, as Serena & Venus broke twice in each of the sets, saving three break points in the first set, and not facing a single one in the second, to claim the 2008 Wimbledon doubles title after a mere fifty-eight minutes of play, on the score of 6–2, 6–2. The doubles title was Serena & Venus' third in Wimbledon, and the seventh overall together, since the 1999 French Open. The win also marked the third time the sisters won the doubles title of Wimbledon while one of them won the singles title, and the second in which they won the doubles while both of them played the singles final.|$|E
