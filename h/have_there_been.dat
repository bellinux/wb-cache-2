2500|$|Linda Nochlin's essay [...] "Why <b>Have</b> <b>There</b> <b>Been</b> No Great Women Artists?" [...] {{helped to}} ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and {{remains one of}} the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then {{followed}} by a 1972 College Art Association Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled [...] "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the Second-wave feminist movement, of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects. [...] In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. Griselda Pollock is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.|$|E
2500|$|When NX is supported, it {{is enabled}} by default. [...] Windows allows {{programs}} to control which pages disallow execution through its API {{as well as}} through the section headers in a PE file. In the API, runtime access to the NX bit is exposed through the Win32 API calls VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect. [...] Each page may be individually flagged as executable or non-executable. [...] Despite the lack of previous x86 hardware support, both executable and non-executable page settings have been provided since the beginning. [...] On pre-NX CPUs, the presence of the 'executable' attribute has no effect. [...] It was documented as if it did function, and, as a result, most programmers used it properly. In the PE file format, each section can specify its executability. [...] The execution flag has existed {{since the beginning of the}} format and standard linkers have always used this flag correctly, even long before the NX bit. Because of this, Windows is able to enforce the NX bit on old programs. [...] Assuming the programmer complied with [...] "best practices", applications should work correctly now that NX is actually enforced. [...] Only in a few cases <b>have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> problems; Microsoft's own [...]NET Runtime had problems with the NX bit and was updated.|$|E

2500|$|In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche proclaims that a {{table of}} values hangs above every great person. He points out that what is common among {{different}} peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not {{the content of their}} beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. [...] "A thousand goals <b>have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> so far," [...] says Zarathustra, [...] "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." [...] Hence, the title of the aphorism, [...] "On The Thousand And One Goals". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. Max Weber and Martin Heidegger absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.|$|E
2500|$|Feminist {{interest}} in Artemisia Gentileschi was sparked in the 1970s when feminist art historian Linda Nochlin {{published an article}} titled [...] "Why <b>Have</b> <b>There</b> <b>Been</b> No Great Women Artists?" [...] in which that question was dissected and analyzed. The article explored the definition of [...] "great artists" [...] and how oppressive institutions, not lack of talent, have prevented women from achieving {{the same level of}} recognition that men received in art and other fields. Nochlin said that studies on Artemisia and other female artists were [...] "worth the effort" [...] in [...] "adding to our knowledge of women's achievement and of art history generally." [...] According to the foreword by Douglas Druick in Eve Straussman-Pflanzer's Violence & Virtue: Artemisia’s Judith Slaying Holofernes, Nochlin’s article prompted scholars to make more of an attempt to [...] "integrate women artists into the history of art and culture." [...] Artemisia and her oeuvre became a focus again, having had little attention in art history scholarship save Roberto Longhi’s article [...] "Gentileschi padre e figlia (Gentileschi, father and daughter)" [...] in 1916 and R. Ward Bissell’s article [...] "Artemisia Gentileschi- A New Documented Chronology" [...] in 1968. As Artemisia and her work began to garner new attention among feminists and art historians, more literature about her, fictional and biographical, was published. A fictional account of her life by Anna Banti, wife of critic Roberto Longhi, was published in 1947. This account was received well by literary critics but was criticized by feminists, notably Laura Benedetti, for being lenient in historical accuracy in order to draw parallels between author and artist. The first full, factual account of Artemisia’s life, The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art, was published in 1989 by Mary Garrard, a feminist art historian. She then published a second, smaller book titled Artemisia Gentileschi around 1622: The Shaping and Reshaping of an Artistic Identity in 2001 which explored the artist’s work and identity. Garrard noted that analysis of Artemisia’s oeuvre lacks focus and stable categorization outside of [...] "woman," [...] though Garrard questions whether femaleness is a legitimate category by which to judge her art at all.|$|E
