5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably.

5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes {{mentioned in}} the previous section, and influenced by all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.|$|E

Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
