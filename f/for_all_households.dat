40|$|OBJECTIVES. In {{the face}} of rising costs of {{surveillance}} systems, {{it is time to}} reexamine the feasibility of including proxy respondents in surveys designed to provide population estimates of smoking prevalence. METHODS. Data are from the California. Tobacco Surveys, which are random-digit dialed telephone surveys. One adult provided demographic information and smoking status <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>household</b> residents. Additionally, some adults were selected for in-depth interviews that also included smoking status questions. We matched information from proxy respondents and self-respondents and evaluated smoking status discrepancies between them relative to demographic and other factors (n = 2930 matched pairs) in 1992. We address the potential bias these discrepancies might introduce into the population estimate of smoking prevalence. RESULTS. Overall, the discrepancy between proxy report and self-report was 4. 3 %, and it increased particularly when the self-respondent reported nondaily smoking or recent quitting. Discrepancies acted in both directions, and the net bias was that the screener survey overestimated smoking prevalence by 0. 1 % in 1992 (0. 3 % in 1990). CONCLUSIONS. Smoking status questions can be added to ongoing surveys such as the census or labor force surveys; one adult could provide smoking status <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>household</b> members...|$|R
