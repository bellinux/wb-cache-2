40|$|A {{total of}} 500. 7 m of continuous, vertical, oceanic gabbroic section was {{recovered}} during Leg 118. The <b>gabbros</b> obtained exhibited {{various degrees of}} alteration and deformation, which gave us {{a good opportunity to}} study the magnetic properties of oceanic <b>gabbros.</b> Many of these <b>gabbros,</b> which are mainly Fe-Ti oxide <b>gabbros,</b> have strong and unstable secondary magnetic components that were acquired during drilling. Stable inclinations, which are probably in-situ magnetic directions, show a single polarity, with an average value of 66 ° (± 5 °), meaning that the studied 501 -m oceanic gabbroic block may be a candidate for the source of the marine magnetic anomaly. This may also imply that the metamorphism of oceanic <b>gabbros</b> causing acquisition of magnetization probably occurred within one geomagnetic polarity chron (about 0. 3 to 0. 7 m. y.) after these <b>gabbros</b> formed at the ridge, leading us to conclude that oceanic <b>gabbros</b> record the so-called Vine-Matthews-Morley type of initial magnetization at the ridge. The average intensity value of stable magnetic components of individual samples, which may be a minimum estimate for remanent magnetizations, is 1. 6 A/m. Assuming this magnetic intensity value and a uniform magnetization within an oceanic gabbroic layer having a thickness of 4. 5 km (i. e., whole layer 3), it is possible to explain most of the marine magnetic anomaly. If magnetic properties of the samples obtained from Hole 735 B are common to oceanic <b>gabbros,</b> layer 3 may contribute more significantly to seafloor spreading magnetic anomalies than previously thought...|$|R

Sr and O isotopic analyses provide constraints on the nature and origin of the fluids associated with these alteration events. Massive <b>gabbros,</b> dykes and veins and their associated minerals depart from mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) -source magma signatures (87 Sr/ 86 Sr 407032 and depleted d 18 O 56 %).

Samples affected by low-temperature alteration during greenschist-facies metamorphism are characterized by high water/rock ratios (410). A second group of samples, including massive <b>gabbros</b> and high-temperature dykes and veins, is characterized by lower water/rock ratios, in the range of 3 [...] - 5.

This hole penetrated âˆ¼ 70 mbsf recovering 40 m of core from the basal 55 m of the hole. The core is dominated by two interlayed lithologies: poikilitic olivine <b>gabbros</b> and brown-pyroxene <b>gabbros,</b> plus volumetrically minor microgabbros, oxide <b>gabbros</b> and leucocratic veins.;Poikilitic olivine <b>gabbros</b> are plagioclase +/- olivine cumulates with relatively primitive mineral composition. Horizons of poikilitic olivine <b>gabbros</b> in the core represent magma chamber replenishment in which the replenishing magma ponded {{at the base of the}} chamber and fractionated. Variations in plagioclase trace element compositions (e. g. La/Nd and Ba/K) in part reflect compositional variation in their parental melts derived from the mantle. Calculated equilibrium melt compositions are highly LREE depleted (Lan/Ndn as low as 0. 25).;Brown-pyroxene <b>gabbros</b> are olivine - plagioclase - clinopyroxene cumulates which have more evolved mineral compositions than poikilitic olivine <b>gabbros.</b> A series of major and trace element characteristics of the rocks, and textural phenomena, indicate that post-cumulus processes were important in their formation. In particular, extreme variations in incompatible element abundances, and fractionation of Zr and Y (and REE's), from the core to rim of clinopyroxene crystals occurs. It is proposed that the fractionation of the interstitial melt was caused by reaction between migration interstitial melt and the crystal assemblage (magmatic metasomatism). This led to the interstitial melt becoming highly evolved in terms of incompatible elements whilst the major elements were efficiently buffered by the crystals. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The western belt of the {{southern}} Albanian ophiolites consists of six major ophiolite massifs (Voskopoja, Rehove, Morava, Devolli, Vallamara, Shpati) and two smaller ones (Luniku and Stravaj). Each massif has a distinct sequence of mantle tectonites, ultramafic umulates (plagioclase-bearing peridotites and wehrlites), cumulate <b>gabbros,</b> troctolites and isotropic <b>gabbros.</b> Voskopoja, Rehove and Morava have predominantly lherzolites as mantle tectonites, Shpati lherzolites and harzburgites, and Devolli and Vallamara lmost exclusively harzburgites. A volcanic section together with volcanogenic sediments occurs only in the Voskopoja nd Rehove massifs {{as well as in}} the smaller Luniku and Stravaj massifs. Whole-rock geochemistry and mineral chemistry suggest a mid-ocean ridge setting for the origin of the cumulates and <b>gabbros</b> from the Voskopoja, Rehove and Morava massifs, with only a minor suprasubduction zone (SSZ) influence. The Shpati massif and the small Luniku massif show mid-ocean ridge (MOR) and SSZ signatures in their plutonic sequences.
