5000|$|The U.S. {{label for}} <b>dronedarone</b> {{includes}} a boxed warning, stating that <b>dronedarone</b> is contraindicated {{in patients with}} NYHA Class IV heart failure, with NYHA Class II-III heart failure with a recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or referral to a specialized heart failure clinic, or with permanent atrial fibrillation." [...] <b>Dronedarone</b> is also associated with rare cases of severe liver damage, including liver failure.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{randomized}} to <b>dronedarone</b> {{were more}} likely to develop bradycardia and QT-interval prolongation (but only 1 case of Torsades). Nausea, diarrhea, rash, and creatinine elevation also were more common in the <b>dronedarone</b> arm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dronedarone</b> {{has been}} tested in some trials {{as a way to}} improve the success rate of {{electrical}} cardioversion.

50|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{compared}} <b>dronedarone</b> to placebo and to amiodarone, {{for its ability}} to reduce atrial fibrillation, to reduce mortality overall and from cardiac causes, and for its adverse effects, including excess mortality. <b>Dronedarone</b> is a non-iodinated class III anti-arrhythmic drug which helps patients return to normal sinus rhythm. This treatment for AF is also known to reduce associated mortality and hospitalizations compared to other similar antiarrhythmic agents.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>dronedarone</b> is a {{benzofuran}} derivative {{related to}} amiodarone, a popular antiarrhythmic. The use of amiodarone {{is limited by}} toxicity due its high iodine content (pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid disease) {{as well as by}} liver disease. In <b>dronedarone,</b> the iodine moieties are not present, reducing toxic effects on the thyroid and other organs. A methylsulfonamide group is added to reduce solubility in fats (lipophobicity) and thus reduce neurotoxic effects.|$|E

5000|$|Venetoclax is metabolized by CYP3A4/5 as proven by {{in-vitro}} studies. Those {{using the}} drug should not consume grapefruit products because they contain CYP3A inhibitors.

[...] Venetoclax is excreted from the body via the fecal route.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dronedarone</b> {{has been}} termed a “multichannel blocker” {{however it is}} unclear which channel(s) play {{a pivotal role in}} its success. Thus, dronedarone's actions at the {{cellular}} level are controversial with most studies suggesting an inhibition in multiple outward potassium currents including rapid delayed rectifier, slow delayed rectifier and ACh-activated inward rectifier. It is also believed to reduce inward rapid Na current and L-type Ca channels. The reduction in K current in some studies was shown to be due to the inhibition of K-ACh channel or associated GTP-binding proteins. Reduction of K+ current by 69% led to increased AP duration and increased effective refractory periods, thus shown to suppress pacemaker potential of the SA node and return patients to a normal heart rhythm. In a European trial, the average time to recurrence of an arrhythmia was 41 days in the placebo group vs. 96 days in the <b>dronedarone</b> group (similar results obtained in the non-European trial, 59 and 158 days respectively).|$|E
50|$|In a {{more recent}} atrial {{fibrillation}} trial, ATHENA, with 4628 subjects, <b>dronedarone</b> was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the composite endpoint of first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death.

50|$|In {{the realm}} of {{acquired}} arrhythmias, Antzelevitch's research team {{was the first to}} recognize that the antianginal drug ranolazine blocks the electrical pathway in the heart known as the late sodium channel, an atrial-selective action that has potential benefit in the treatment of AF. With cardiac electrophysiologist Alexander Burashnikov, PhD, Antzelevitch subsequently hypothesized and then demonstrated that combining ranolazine with <b>dronedarone,</b> a drug with a similar action but different mechanism, can significantly suppress the occurrence of AF.|$|E
50|$|Yan’s {{development}} of the cardiac wedge preparation has also allowed cardiac researchers to test new drug treatments for various heart diseases. The sample cardiac tissue can be stimulated to mimic specific aberrant states in order to observe the effects of medications and cardiac safety. Throughout his career, Yan has conducted laboratory assessments using the cardiac wedge as a model; these studies have included investigations of drug therapies that {{reduce the risk of}} torsades de pointes as well as a medication that reduces the long QT interval in Timothy syndrome. Other scientists have used the wedge preparation to test pharmaceutical treatments as well. Alexander Burashnikov, PhD, and colleagues, for example, found that a combination of ranolazine and <b>dronedarone</b> can suppress atrial fibrillation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dronedarone</b> (development codename SR33589 {{and marketed}} as Multaq) {{is a drug}} by Sanofi-Aventis, mainly for the {{indication}} of cardiac arrhythmias. It {{was approved by the}} FDA on July 2, 2009. It was recommended as an alternative to amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in people whose hearts have either returned to normal rhythm or who undergo drug therapy or electric shock treatment i.e. direct current cardioversion (DCCV) to maintain normal rhythm. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug. In the United States, the FDA approved label includes a claim for reducing hospitalization, but not for reducing mortality, as a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated in the clinical development program. A trial of the drug in heart failure was stopped as an interim analysis showed a possible increase in heart failure deaths, in patients with moderate to severe CHF.|$|E
40|$|Renee M Sullivan, Brian OlshanskyDivision of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USAIntroduction: <b>Dronedarone,</b> a {{benzofuran}} derivative with {{a structure}} similar to amiodarone, {{has been developed}} as a potential therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. Aim: To review the published evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of <b>dronedarone</b> use in patients with atrial fibrillation. Evidence review: Available evidence suggests that <b>dronedarone</b> 400 mg orally twice daily can lengthen the time to and decrease the overall recurrence of atrial fibrillation compared with placebo. <b>Dronedarone</b> may reduce risk of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving <b>dronedarone</b> had improved ventricular rate control compared with patients receiving placebo. <b>Dronedarone</b> is associated with few serious adverse events except, notably, in patients with decompensated heart failure. Place in therapy: <b>Dronedarone</b> may {{have a role in}} rate and rhythm control for patients with atrial fibrillation. <b>Dronedarone</b> can reduce unique, but potentially serious, end points in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite this, the exact role of <b>dronedarone</b> in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation continues to emerge. It remains uncertain if <b>dronedarone</b> should be considered a primary treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation. <b>Dronedarone</b> should not be administered to patients with decompensated heart failure. Conclusion: <b>Dronedarone</b> is a unique drug that may serve a key role to treat patients with atrial fibrillation. Keywords: <b>dronedarone,</b> atrial fibrillatio...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{increases the}} risk of stroke. <b>Dronedarone</b> has been shown to reduce the composite of hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events or death, in subjects with intermittent atrial fibrillation or flutter. Recently, <b>dronedarone</b> has been tested in subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation in the PALLAS (permanent atrial fibrillation outcome study using <b>dronedarone</b> on top of standard therapy) trial, and this clinical trial is evaluated in this paper. PALLAS was stopped early as there was an increased incidence of cardiovascular events in the <b>dronedarone</b> group. <b>Dronedarone</b> also increased the rate of hospitalizations in PALLAS. As a result of PALLAS, <b>dronedarone</b> has been contraindicated in permanent atrial fibrillation. The outcomes of PALLAS highlight a discontinuity between <b>dronedarone</b> actions in permanent and intermittent atrial fibrillation. The mechanism(s) underlying the detrimental effects of <b>dronedarone</b> in permanent atrial fibrillation are unknown at present and need to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Dronedarone</b> is an {{amiodarone}} analog but differs structurally from amiodarone in {{that the}} iodine moiety was removed and a methane-sulfonyl group was added. These modifications reduced thyroid and other end-organ adverse effects and makes <b>dronedarone</b> less lipophilic, shortening its half-life. <b>Dronedarone</b> {{has been shown to}} prevent atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFl) recurrences in several multi-center trials. In addition to its rhythm control properties, <b>dronedarone</b> has rate control properties and slows the ventricular response during AF. <b>Dronedarone</b> is approved in Europe for rhythm and rate control indications. In patients with decompensated heart failure, <b>dronedarone</b> treatment increased mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. However, when <b>dronedarone</b> was used in elderly high risk AF/AFl patients excluding such high risk heart failure, cardiovascular hospitalizations were significantly reduced and the drug was approved in the USA for this indication in 2009 by the Food and Drug Administration. Updated guidelines suggest <b>dronedarone</b> as a front-line antiarrhythmic in many patients with AF/Fl but caution that the drug should not be used in patients with advanced heart failure. In addition, the recent results of the PALLAS trial suggest that <b>dronedarone</b> should not be used in the long-term treatment of patients with permanent AF...|$|E
