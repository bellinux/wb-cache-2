It needs to be substituted with other non-gluten, that is rice flour. Rice flour made from rice, which is a staple food for Indonesian peoples. Dietary fiber added to rice cake is from rice bran, by product of rice milling with limited utilization. Rice bran has high fat so it needs to be defatted to minimize rancid flavor in rice cake.

40|$|Rice bran, a {{good source}} of protein and fat, is at present underutilized as a food material. The {{potential}} of producing rice bran at the global level is 27. 3 million t. The presence of enzyme lipase in rice bran causes rapid deterioration of oil to free fatty acids and glycerol. Various stabilization techniques involving heat treatment, low-temperature storage, chemical treatment, control of relative humidity during storage, and simultaneous milling and extraction were evolved to inactivate lipase. Multiple forms of rice bran lipase have been identified. Fractional classification of proteins reveals a high percentage of albumins and globulins. Proteins can be extracted from full-fat or <b>defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> by alkaline extraction and acid or heat precipitation. Extraction procedures influence the protein content of concentrates, which ranged from 19. 4 to 76. 1 % in concentrates from full-fat rice bran and 17. 5 to 85. 0 % in concentrates from <b>defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran.</b> The PER of rice bran ranges from 1. 59 to 2. 04 and that of protein concentrates from 1. 99 to 2. 19.

Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the effects of <b>defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> and rice bran oil in an average American diet on blood lipids in moderately hypercholesterolemic persons. Design: Study 1 used a parallel-arm design. Twenty-six healthy volunteers consumed a diet with 13 – 22 g dietary fiber/d for 3 wk, and then 13 of the volunteers were switched to a diet with <b>defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> to double the fiber intake for 5 wk. Study 2 was a randomized, crossover, 10 -wk feeding study performed in 14 volunteers who consumed a diet with rice bran oil (1 / 3 of the total dietary fat) substituted for an oil blend that had a fatty acid composition similar to that of the rice bran oil. Serum lipids and factor VII were measured in both studies. Results: <b>Defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> did not lower lipid concentrations. In study 2, total cholesterol was significantly lower with consumption of the diet containing rice bran oil than with consumption of the control diet.

Conclusions: Rice bran oil, not fiber, lowers cholesterol in healthy, moderately hypercholesterolemic adults.

As a preliminary, the RB carbon particles are manufactured impregnating a phenol resin (25 wt. %) with the <b>defatted</b> <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> and carbonizing at 900 °C. In the first strengthening process, the mixture of the carbonized RB carbon particles and a phenol resin are then pressure formed to make a disk-shape RB carbon (CRB). Since the RB carbon particles are brittle and therefore they are broken during the pressure forming, the pore size can be smaller in the CRB than in the RBC. In the second strengthening process, the mixture is injection molded to make a rectangular RB carbon (IMCRB). The pore size is also smaller in the IMCRB. The compressive strength, bending strength and fracture toughness are increased in the both strengthened materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{profiles}} of bioactive compounds (including phenolics and flavonoids in free and bound fractions, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, vitamin E, and γ-oryzanol) of outer and inner <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> from six colored rice samples collected from local markets were investigated. Proanthocyanidins {{could only be}} detected in red <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> but not in black <b>rice</b> <b>bran.</b> The free fraction of the extracts dominated the total phenolics (72 – 92 %) and the total flavonoids (72 – 96 %) of colored <b>rice</b> <b>bran.</b> Most of the phenolic acids (83 – 97 %) in colored <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> {{were present in the}} bound form. Protocatechualdehyde was identified {{for the first time in}} the bound fraction of red <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The antioxidative activities of the free fraction of the colored <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> were attributed to the proanthocyanidins in red colored rice and anthocyanins in black rice, while that of the bound fraction was mainly due to the phenolic acids...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Emerging {{evidence}} supporting chronic disease fighting properties of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> has advanced {{the development of}} stabilized <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> for human use as a functional food and dietary supplement. A global and targeted metabolomic investigation of stabilized <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> fermented with Saccharomyces boulardii was performed in three rice varieties. Metabolites from S. boulardiifermented <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and assessed for bioactivity compared to nonfermented <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> in normal and malignant lymphocytes. Global metabolite profiling revealed {{significant differences in the}} metabolome that led to discovery of candidate compounds modulated by S. boulardii fermentation. Fermented <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> extracts from three rice varieties reduced growth of human B lymphomas compared to each variety’s nonfermented control and revealed that fermentation differentially altered bioactive compounds. These data support that integration of global and targeted metabolite analysis can be utilized for assessing health properties of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> phytochemicals that are enhanced by yeast fermentation and that differ across rice varieties...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>bran</b> is a {{by-product}} of rice milling industry and constitutes around 10 % of the total weight of rough rice. It is primarily composed of aleurone, pericarp, subaleurone layer and germ. <b>Rice</b> <b>bran</b> is {{a rich source of}} vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, dietary fiber and other sterols. There is a widespread scientific agreement on various health benefits associated with consumption of dietary fiber. Consumer attitude towards health foods is promising and the scope of functional foods is growing in the world markets; <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> is finding increased applications in food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. However, potential applications of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> in food industry are limited by its instability owing to rancidity caused by exposure of oil to lipases during milling. Various methods of stabilization have been carried out, paving way for supplementation of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> in numerous food preparations. Considering the importance of <b>rice</b> <b>bran,</b> this review aims to focus on the functionalities of <b>rice</b> <b>bran,</b> its health benefits and potential applications in food industry...|$|R
