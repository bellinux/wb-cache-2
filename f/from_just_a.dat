5|$|Before {{joining the}} Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, {{then at the}} Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club {{returned}} to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for {{the next twenty years}} (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped {{it with a}} then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> flamethrower to a pitcher.

25|$|In 1837, Mihail Kogălniceanu {{published}} {{a book on the}} Roma people, in which he expressed the hope that it will serve the abolitionists. During the 1840s, the intellectuals began a campaign aimed at convincing the slaveholders to free their slaves. The Wallachian Cezar Bolliac published in his Foaie pentru Minte, Inimă şi Literatură an appeal to intellectuals to support the cause of the abolitionist movement. <b>From</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few voices advocating abolitionism in the 1830s, in the 1840s, it became a subject of great debate in Romanian society. The political power was in the hand of the conservative boyars, who were also owners of large numbers of slaves and as such disagreed to any reforms that might affect them.|$|E
25|$|For {{positive}} real x, y and s, x'y/y → 0, when (x, y) → (0, s). This {{seems to}} justify setting γ(s, 0) = 0 for real s > 0. However, matters are somewhat {{different in the}} complex realm. Only if (a) the real part of s is positive, and (b) values u'v are taken <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> finite set of branches, they are guaranteed to converge to zero as (u, v) → (0, s), and so does γ(u, v). On a single branch of γ(b) is naturally fulfilled, so there γ(s, 0) = 0 for s with positive real part is a continuous limit. Also note that such a continuation {{is by no means}} an analytic one.|$|E
25|$|The monarchs are {{generally}} monogamous, with the pair bonds ranging <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> single season (as in the African paradise flycatcher) to life (the Elepaio). Only three species {{are known to}} engage in cooperative breeding; but many species are as yet unstudied. They {{are generally}} territorial, defending territories that are around 2 ha in size, but a few species may cluster their nesting sites closely together. Nesting sites may also be chosen close to aggressive species, for example leaden flycatchers nests may be located near the nests of the aggressive noisy friarbird. The nests are in turn often aggressively defended by monarch species. In all species the nest is an open cup on a branch, fork or twig. In some species the nests can be highly conspicuous.|$|E

25|$|Gulls are monogamous {{and colonial}} breeders that display mate {{fidelity}} that usually lasts {{for the life}} of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary <b>from</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a 5-m radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.|$|E
