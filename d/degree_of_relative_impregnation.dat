40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impacts <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> divergence in open macroeconomic {{policies in the}} context of the trilemma hypothesis. Using an index that measures the relative policy divergence among the three trilemma policy choices, namely monetary independence, exchange rate stability, and financial openness, we find that emerging market countries have adopted trilemma policy combinations with the least <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> policy divergence in the last fifteen years. We find that a developing or emerging market country with a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> policy divergence is more likely to experience a currency or debt crisis. However, a developing or emerging market country with a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> policy divergence tends to experience smaller output losses when it experiences a currency or banking crisis. Latin American crisis countries tended to reduce their financial integration in the aftermath of a crisis, while this is not the case for the Asian crisis countries. The Asian crisis countries tended to reduce the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> policy divergence in the aftermath of the crisis, probably aiming at macroeconomic policies that are less prone to crises.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is influenced by genes lying distant to the major histocompatibility complex. This study compares genetic models of AS to assess the most likely mode of inheritance, using recurrence risk ratios in <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> affected subjects.  METHODS—Recurrence risk ratios in different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> were determined using published data from studies specifically designed to address the question. The methods of Risch {{were used to determine}} the expected recurrence risk ratios in different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>relatives,</b> assuming equal first degree relative recurrence risk between models. Goodness of fit was determined by χ 2 comparison of the expected number of affected subjects with the observed number, given equal numbers of each type <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> studied.  RESULTS—The recurrence risks in different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> were: monozygotic (MZ) twins 63 % (17 / 27), first degree relatives 8. 2 % (441 / 5390), second degree relatives 1. 0 % (8 / 834), and third degree relatives 0. 7 % (7 / 997). Parent-child recurrence risk (7. 9 %, 37 / 466) was not significantly different from the sibling recurrence risk (8. 2 %, 404 / 4924), excluding a significant dominance genetic component to susceptibility. Poor fitting models included single gene, genetic heterogeneity, additive, two locus multiplicative, and one locus and residual polygenes (χ 2 > 32 (two <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom), p< 10 − 6 for all models). The best fitting model studied was a five locus model with multiplicative interaction between loci (χ 2 = 1. 4 (two <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom), p= 0. 5). Oligogenic multiplicative models were the best fitting over a range of population prevalences and first degree recurrence risk rates.  CONCLUSIONS—This study suggests that of the genetic models tested, the most likely model operating in AS is an oligogenic model with predominantly multiplicative interaction between loci. ...|$|R
