[...] Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today {{described it as}} [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "loosely connected" [...] {{to the rest of}} the series, writing that he is [...] "not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place." [...] Liu considers his subplot to be a type of [...] "throw everything against the wall and see what sticks" [...] element and writes that [...] "many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> job of balancing the subplot and the main one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

[...] "If our fiction took it on {{the human}} ground, and ascertained its inner pathos, its real lamentableness, it might <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> thing with those clubmen and society girls and grandes dames. But {{that remains to be}} seen. In the mean time it is very much to have such a study of society as Mr. Pulitzer has given us. For the most part it is 'satire with no pity in it,' but there's here and there a touch of compassion, which moves the more because of its rarity. When the author notes that here and there a pretty dear finds herself left with no one to take her out to supper at the ball, his few words wring the heart. 'These poor victims of their sex cannot, like the men, form tables of their own. All that each can do is to disappear as swiftly and as secretly as possible, hurrying home in humiliation for the present and despair for the future.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{absence of}} {{precocious}} symptoms of genius {{is on the}} whole more striking {{in the lives of}} men who have distinguished themselves than their juvenile promise; though it must be added that Mr. Lathrop has made out, as he was almost in duty bound to <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> case in favour of Hawthorne's having been an interesting child. He was not at any time what would be called a sociable man, and there is therefore nothing unexpected in {{the fact that he was}} fond of long walks in which he was not known to have had a companion. [...] "Juvenile literature" [...] was but scantily known at that time, and the enormous and extraordinary contribution made by the United States to this department of human happiness was locked in the bosom of futurity. The young Hawthorne, therefore, like many of his contemporaries, was constrained to amuse himself, for want of anything better, with the Pilgrim's Progress and the Faery Queen. A boy may have worse company than Bunyan and Spenser, and it is very probable that in his childish rambles our author may have had associates of whom there could be no record. When he was nine years old he met with an accident at school which threatened for a while to have serious results. He was struck on the foot by a ball and so severely lamed that he was kept at home for a long time, and had not completely recovered before his twelfth year. His school, it is to be supposed, was the common day-school of New England--the primary factor in that extraordinarily pervasive system of instruction in the plainer branches of learning, which forms one of the principal ornaments of American life. In 1818, when he was fourteen years old, he was taken by his mother to live in the house of an uncle, her brother, who was established in the town of Raymond, near Lake Sebago, in the State of Maine. The immense State of Maine, in the year 1818, must have had an even more magnificently natural character than it possesses at the present day, and the uncle's dwelling, in consequence of being in a little smarter style than the primitive structures that surrounded it, was known by the villagers as Manning's Folly. Mr. Lathrop pronounces this region to be of a [...] "weird and woodsy" [...] character; and Hawthorne, later in life, spoke of it to a friend as the place where [...] "I first got my cursed habits of solitude." [...] The outlook, indeed, for an embryonic novelist, would not seem to have been cheerful; the social dreariness of a small New England community lost amid the forests of Maine, at the beginning of the present century, must have been consummate. But for a boy with a relish for solitude there were many natural resources, and we can understand that Hawthorne should in after years have spoken very tenderly of this episode. [...] "I lived in Maine like a bird of the air, so perfect was the freedom I enjoyed." [...] During the long summer days he roamed, gun in hand, through the great woods, and during the moonlight nights of winter, says his biographer, quoting another informant, [...] "he would skate until midnight, all alone, upon Sebago Lake, with the deep shadows of the icy hills on either hand." ...|$|E
