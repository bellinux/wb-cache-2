5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been <b>disadvantaged</b> {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain <b>disadvantaged</b> with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more <b>disadvantaged.</b> In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates {{received}} the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the <b>Disadvantaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{separate}} incident, Conner claimed that Patton helped a construction company she owned obtain certification as a <b>disadvantaged</b> business, {{which gave the}} company special preference when bidding for state contracts.|$|E
5|$|Karamoko Alfa {{managed to}} enlist <b>disadvantaged</b> {{groups such as}} gangs of young men, outlaws and slaves.|$|E
5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other <b>disadvantaged</b> Americans, should be {{compensated}} for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all <b>disadvantaged</b> groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} been in place since 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland has fewer <b>disadvantaged</b> students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and <b>disadvantaged</b> students receive around £560 a year less in financial support than their counterparts in England do.|$|E
5|$|He {{nonetheless}} persevered, {{staging a}} three-week, 17-city {{tour of the}} nation's ghettos and <b>disadvantaged</b> areas that none of his advisors thought politically worthwhile. He sought to engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with hippies and The Diggers in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, in {{an attempt}} to combat poverty, the {{government}} introduced the Universal Child Allowance, a cash transfer program to parents who are unemployed or in the informal economy. It was later expanded to cover other <b>disadvantaged</b> groups.|$|E
5|$|In Nashville, {{like most}} Southern cities, African Americans were {{severely}} <b>disadvantaged</b> under {{the system of}} Jim Crow segregation. Besides being relegated to underfunded schools and barred from numerous public accommodations, African Americans had few prospects for skilled employment and were subject to constant discrimination from the white majority.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Jacob Holdt (b. 1947) spent {{a number}} of years in the United States where he photographed scenes of the {{socially}} <b>disadvantaged</b> across the country. In his book American Pictures (1977), a worldwide success, he contrasted these with photographs of the American elite, hoping to provide a basis for social reform.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015–16 school year, the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District {{enrolled}} approximately 1,469 students; {{of which}} 16 (1percent) {{were eligible for}} free lunch and 6 students were eligible for reduced-price lunch. The student body is 52% male and 48% female. One percent of students are economically <b>disadvantaged</b> and nine percent have reported disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Fordham and its {{surrounding}} neighborhoods vary according to campus. At Rose Hill, the University actively recruits Bronx students from <b>disadvantaged</b> backgrounds through the Higher Education Opportunity Program. In addition, about 80% of students participate in local community service.|$|E
5|$|Since his {{retirement}} as a player, Southall has briefly managed Dover Athletic, Hastings United and Margate, and has coached at numerous clubs {{as well as}} the Welsh national youth teams. He has also worked extensively with <b>disadvantaged</b> children, and set up his own educational consultancy.|$|E
5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively <b>disadvantaged</b> when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were <b>disadvantaged</b> in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm. A new scheme was announced in 2014; after a transitional period lasting until 2019, lowland farms will receive almost £200 per hectare while farms in <b>disadvantaged</b> areas will receive £166. The total payment for Wales between 2014 and 2020 will be £1,870 million, but some of this (15%) {{will be used for}} rural development projects.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s and {{continuing}} {{in the next two}} decades, the university saw the construction and modernization {{of a large number of}} facilities and the construction of the library, science building, residence halls and the University center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally <b>disadvantaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically <b>disadvantaged</b> children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from <b>disadvantaged</b> households.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory personal, {{social and}} health {{education}} {{was introduced in}} 2009. The Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 provided parents with the option to split the year's maternity leave the mother could then take from her employment, allowing parents greater flexibility with childcare arrangements. An extension of 10–15 hours free nursery provision for <b>disadvantaged</b> 2-year olds was also carried out. Between 2008 and 2010, additional money was put into tax credits for families with children, while child poverty fell during Brown's last year as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Doomfist is a fictional, playable {{character}} in the 2016 video game Overwatch whose design {{is based on a}} powerful, cybernetic gauntlet. As an offensive, brawler-style character, he uses mostly close-range attacks: a charged punch, uppercut, and slam. He is advantaged by his high mobility, but <b>disadvantaged</b> if left in a group while his attacks are recharging. Doomfist was released in late July 2017 as the title's 25th hero, and the fourth introduced after the game's launch.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, in {{the case}} of Dung Thi Thuy Nguyen v. The Netherlands, the Committee {{expressed}} concerns about aspects of parental leave provisions in The Netherlands. It recommended the Dutch government collect further information on the number of women combining part-time salaried employment with self-employment, and review the law if this revealed that a significant number of women were <b>disadvantaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously <b>disadvantaged</b> by the current format.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the deployment, South African {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} veto the involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians <b>disadvantaged</b> by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training {{for the people of}} South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{beginning}} his NFL career, Manning {{started his own}} charity called 'the Peyback Foundation'. The Peyback Foundation's mission is to help <b>disadvantaged</b> kids, and focuses its efforts in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Indiana. For his work with this foundation, Manning received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are <b>disadvantaged</b> in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|The {{baseline}} {{standard for}} the construction of or expansion to a freeway in Ontario is an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day. However, other factors are considered as well, particularly future traffic volume forecasts. To promote economic development in a <b>disadvantaged</b> region (e.g., the current extension of Highway 400 to Northern Ontario), a 400-series highway may be built where the existing highway's traffic counts fall below 10,000.|$|E
5|$|The charity itself {{works to}} prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people and it also aims to support, inform and inspire {{vulnerable}} and <b>disadvantaged</b> young people to help them reach their full potential. On 12 March 2013, {{with the help of}} ex-addict Russell Brand, the Foundation launched the Amy Winehouse Foundation Resilience Programme For Schools across the UK which aims to provide effective education around drugs, alcohol and dealing with emotional issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants {{were some of the}} most literate in Europe, and consequently had access to the European egalitarian and radical ideas that culminated in the Revolutions of 1848. The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among the <b>disadvantaged,</b> many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport is}} {{classified}} as a B1 event, meaning that it is for blind athletes, however vision-impaired athletes are also able to take part as all competitors wear eyeshades to ensure they are equally <b>disadvantaged.</b> Goalkeepers may be sighted {{as long as they}} have not been registered with FIFA since 2003. Each team may also have a guide behind their opponents' goal to direct players.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} also houses {{an independent}} nonprofit organization, Community Impact, which strives to serve <b>disadvantaged</b> {{people in the}} Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights communities. From its earliest inception as a single service initiative formed in 1981 by Columbia University undergraduates, Community Impact has grown into Columbia University's largest student service organization. CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of a dedicated corps of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.|$|E
5|$|Whitney High School {{runs along}} the Response to Intervention guideline; the RTI model {{implements}} a three-tiered research-based plan to catch students who are struggling in their schooling. The model implements a number of measures intended to assist students, including an intervention period, an AVID program, night and summer school programs, and Section 504 plans. Among the programs, the intervention periods are twenty minutes set before lunch that is intended for students who need to fulfill the academic requirements {{in which they are}} lacking. The AVID program pertains to students who are socially or economically <b>disadvantaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are <b>disadvantaged</b> with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been <b>disadvantaged</b> in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able to}} initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the <b>disadvantaged</b> persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is <b>disadvantaged</b> because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into <b>disadvantaged</b> areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
