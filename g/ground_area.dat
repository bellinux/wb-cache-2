5|$|The City of London's first {{reconstruction}} {{plan was}} written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the <b>ground</b> <b>area.</b> For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.|$|E

25|$|Westonzoyland {{airfield}} {{originated in}} the mid-1920s as a landing ground, being in use by 1926 for drogue tugs using the anti-aircraft gunnery range off Watchet in the Bristol Channel. At first, it {{was no more than}} an extended cow pasture, subject only to seasonal use until the Second World War loomed, when the site was occupied on a permanent basis. During the pre-war years, buildings were erected piecemeal as required and the landing <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> gradually enlarged but, with the fall of France, Westonzoyland was no longer a backwater airfield.|$|E

50|$|There are {{approximately}} 54000 sq ft of building space on this multi-acre <b>grounds</b> <b>area.</b> The facility houses the Courts System, Sheriff’s Department, Jail, {{and all other}} County Agencies except for the Airport, Highway, and Forestry Departments.|$|R
25|$|The US Forest Service tested chitosan, a biopesticide, to pre-arm {{pine trees}} to defend {{themselves}} against MPB. The US Forest Service results show collodial chitosan elicited a 40% increase in pine resin (P<0.05) in southern pine trees. One milliliter chitosan per 10 gallons water {{was applied to the}} <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> within the drip ring of loblolly pine trees. The application was repeated three times from May through September in 2008. The chitosan was responsible for eliciting natural defense responses of increased resin pitch-outs, with the ability to destroy 37% of the pine beetle eggs.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{multi-storey}} car parks provide lower {{building cost}} per parking slot, as they typically require less building volume and less <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> than a conventional facility {{with the same}} capacity. However, {{the cost of the}} mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs {{to be added to the}} building cost to determine the total cost. Other costs are usually lower too, for example there is no need for an energy-intensive ventilating system, since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed.|$|E
25|$|Bergfrieds {{averaged}} 20 to 30 metres in height, {{although those}} at Forchtenstein Castle in Burgenland, Austria, and Freistadt Castle reach {{a height of}} 50 metres. Compared with the donjon, which occupies a relatively large <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> because of its elaborate interior layout with living rooms, a hall, kitchen, etc., the bergfried usually has a much smaller footprint, which, although of similar height to the donjon gives it the slimmer appearance of a tower. As a building, the bergfried has an even stronger vertical emphasis than the donjon.|$|E
50|$|Bare-wire or ground-return {{telecommunications}} can {{be compromised}} by the ground-return current if the <b>grounding</b> <b>area</b> is closer than 100 m or sinks more than 10 A of current. Modern radio, optic fibre channels, and cell phone systems are unaffected.|$|R

50|$|The {{land around}} Kongwak was largely cleared of native {{vegetation}} {{and is now}} used for agriculture, including dairying. This land was cleared by two brothers, Richard Nutter Scott and Frederick John Scott. You can see Richard's memorial park on the Kongwak Tennis <b>Grounds</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
25|$|Plans {{deposited}} by Ledingham {{show that}} each house had a <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> of about 350 sq. ft.(the projecting end of terrace houses were slightly larger) with a frontage of about 18ft. On {{the ground floor}} front was a living room containing a range. To the rear was a scullery with a sink and access to a back yard containing an ash house, coal store and a gate to a service road. On the first floor front was a bedroom with a fireplace and walk in wardrobe. On the mezzanine level was a WC.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of this design above the parabolic trough design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures {{can be converted to}} electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need to flatten the <b>ground</b> <b>area.</b> In principle a power tower can be built {{on the side of a}} hill. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the parabolic trough design single axis tracking can be shared for a large array of mirrors.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the houses}} were 10–50 m2 in <b>ground</b> <b>area,</b> and were often {{provided}} with small gardens or vegetable plots, as well as adjoining workshops and storehouses. Inside, {{the houses were}} sometimes partitioned with curtains or wooden partitions, but usually they consisted of a single room; furniture was spartan, consisting of little more than benches and store chests; floors were strewn with rushes or straw; {{the only source of}} heat or light (other than the doorway) was the hearth in the centre of the living room. Rush lights fuelled by mutton fat were available, but they were expensive. A shuttered hole in the roof served as a chimney.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} is for {{use with}} a container of liquid that is suspended from an aircraft flying over a <b>ground</b> target <b>area.</b> The container has an outlet through which the liquid is dropped from the container. The apparatus includes a diffuser configured to diffuse the liquid exiting the container outlet horizontally outward beyond the container into the air above the <b>ground</b> target <b>area,</b> whereby the liquid is diffused over a correspondingly wide area. The liquid can be fire extinguishing liquid, and the <b>ground</b> target <b>area</b> can be a forest fire. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|A major {{export of}} the initial space {{settlement}} designs was anticipated to be large solar power satellites that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked microwave beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste from electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} a major gamble for Paxton, but {{circumstances}} were in his favour - he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built - the Exhibition opening was now {{less than a year}} away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800 - by comparison, this was only about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft. (19 acres, or 7 hectares), would cover roughly twenty-five times the <b>ground</b> <b>area</b> of its progenitor.|$|E

A pick-up and drop-off point with motorcycle parking and a turning circle is situated between the car park and the side entrance to the station. This was {{the first part of}} the New England Quarter to be completed; most of the work was undertaken by the Adenstar Construction Group, based in nearby Portslade. There was a contractual obligation to provide 600 spaces, although the form which this had to take was not specified and various proposals were considered, including a taller multi-storey structure with more floors and a much smaller <b>ground</b> <b>area.</b> During the construction works, a temporary car park was provided on land nearby.|$|E

2500|$|The first vicar, Mr Rice, {{lived in}} a rented house at 22 Edmund Street which still exists. The parish, under the {{leadership}} of Ripley, decided a more permanent arrangement was needed. Ripley donated the site (0.406 acres) on New Cross Street about half a mile south of the church. The architects were T.H and F Healy who placed an invitation to tender in the Bradford Observer on 26 February 1874. The vicarage was completed in 1875, costing £2,050. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners provided £1,300 and the parish raised £750 from benefactions. Contemporary press articles describe it as [...] "on the scale of a [...] "gentleman's residence" [...] and as having [...] "both day and night nurseries".
