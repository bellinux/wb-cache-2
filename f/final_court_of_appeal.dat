5|$|Most of Denmark's top legal {{courts and}} {{institutions}} {{are based in}} Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret), {{it is the largest}} of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (Sø- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (Højesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.|$|E
25|$|The High Court of Australia is {{the supreme}} court in the Australian court {{hierarchy}} and the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> in Australia. It has both original and appellate jurisdiction, the power of judicial review over laws passed by the Parliament of Australia and the parliaments of the States, and the ability to interpret the Constitution of Australia thereby powerfully shaping the development of federalism in Australia.|$|E

25|$|The {{chief justice}} {{is the head}} of the court and has {{precedence}} over any other judges in the republic. The chief justice is second in line (after the vice-president) to succeed the president in case of removal, death or resignation until a new president is elected. The chief justice is also fifth in the line of precedence following the president, prime minister, vice president and deputy prime minister. The current chief justice is Kheshoe Parsad Matadeen having been appointed 31 December 2013 by President Purryag. The major divisions of the Supreme Court are Family Division, Commercial Division, Master's Court, Mediation Division, Criminal Division, Court of Civil Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal.

25|$|The Court of Civil Appeal is a {{division}} of the Supreme Court and is composed of the Judges of the Supreme Court presided by the Chief Justice or the Senior Puisne Judge. The Court of Criminal Appeal is {{a division}} of the Supreme Court and is duly constituted by three judges presided over by the Chief Justice or the Senior Puisne Judge. A person convicted before the Supreme Court may appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act against his conviction or sentence. The Judicial Council is the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> where questions on interpretation of constitution, dispute value is more than 10,000, final provisions of section 17 of Constitution and matters of public importance as directed by Supreme Court.

25|$|In 1926, the King–Byng Affair {{resulted}} in a constitutional crisis which was the impetus {{for changes in the}} relationship between the governor general and the prime minister. Although its key aspects were political in nature, its constitutional aspects continue to be debated. One result was the Balfour Declaration issued later that year, whose principles were eventually codified in the Statute of Westminster 1931. It, and the repeal of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, gave the federal parliament the ability to make extraterritorial laws and abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Criminal appeals were abolished in 1933, but civil appeals continued until 1949. The last Privy Council ruling of constitutional significance occurred in 1954, in Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited. After that, the Supreme Court of Canada became the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{government}} credibility is an important resource and {{that it can be}} improved by delegating decision-making competence beyond the nation-state. It is hypothesized that such delegation should result in higher income and growth. Some former British colonies retained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as their <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> even after independence. This court is thus taken as a natural experiment to test our hypothesis. It turns out that retaining the jurisdiction is indeed significant for explaining economic growth...|$|R

25|$|New Zealand law {{has three}} {{principal}} sources: English common law; certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689); and statutes of the Parliament of New Zealand. In interpreting common law, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption in support of uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. Non-uniformity arises where the New Zealand courts consider local conditions to warrant it or where the law has been codified by New Zealand statute. The maintenance of the Privy Council in London as the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> and judges' practice of tending to follow British decisions, even though, technically, they are not bound by them, both bolstered this presumption. The Supreme Court of New Zealand, which was established by legislation in October 2003 and which replaced the Privy Council for future appeals, has continued to develop the presumption.|$|E
25|$|Lord Hope of Craighead {{delivered}} the majority judgment. Reaffirming that the High Court remained the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> in criminal matters in Scotland {{and that the}} Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to review the merits of its decisions made in exercise of that function, he ruled that the Appeal Court had applied the wrong test in law in relation to article 6(1), namely, whether they believed {{that there had been}} a miscarriage of justice rather than whether there was 'a real possibility that the jury at this trial would have arrived at a different verdict' which created a miscarriage of justice, based on the precedent of McInnes v Her Majesty's Advocate. He concluded that a real possibility existed, and accordingly allowed the appeal, and remitted the matter to the Appeal Court with a direction to quash Fraser's conviction, once it had decided whether he should be re-tried, in exercise of the court's powers under paragraph 13 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.|$|E
25|$|Singapore {{ceased to}} be part of the British Empire in 1963 when it joined the Federation of Malaysia. In 1964, the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore was {{replaced}} by the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore, appeals from which lay to the Federal Court of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. The Privy Council remained the final appellate court, although appellants now submitted their petitions to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (head of state of Malaysia) who sent them on to the Judicial Committee. In turn, the Judicial Committee conveyed their recommendations on appeals to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who then made the final orders. Singapore left the Federation in 1965. At the time of the nation's full independence, no changes were made to the judicial system. It was only with effect from 9 January 1970 that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore consisting of the Court of Appeal and High Court was established. The Judicial Committee Act 1966 was passed to enable the Privy Council to continue its role as Singapore's <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> and to remove the need to petition the British monarch or the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in order to appeal.|$|E

He expressed concern that the new Supreme Court's judges would end up spending as much as 40% of their working time on Privy Council business and was intending to take some pressure off <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> judges by drafting in lower tier judges from the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> to sit on cases from Commonwealth countries. He also added that in an ideal world former Commonwealth countries would stop utilizing the Privy Council and instead set up their own <b>final</b> <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Supreme Court of Canada is {{the highest}} court of Canada. [...] It was created in 1875 by a law passed by the Parliament of Canada, the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.

50|$|Although the {{constitution}} provides {{for an independent}} judiciary, Kyrgyzstan’s court system is widely seen as {{under the influence of}} the prosecutor’s office. Low salaries make the bribery of judges commonplace. Most cases originate in local courts; they then can move via the appeals process to municipal or regional courts, with the Supreme <b>Court</b> the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals.</b> Property and family law disputes and low-level criminal cases are heard by traditional elders’ courts, which are loosely supervised by the prosecutor’s office. Economic disputes and military cases are heard in specialized courts. The constitutional amendments of 2003 expanded the scope <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> in civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings. Many protections of Western jurisprudence are not present in Kyrgyzstan’s system, which retains many features of the Soviet system. The right to counsel and the presumption of innocence of the accused are guaranteed by law but often not practiced. There is no trial by jury. Reform legislation under consideration in 2006 would establish a jury system and bolster the independence of the judicial branch.|$|R

Special leave is granted only where a question of law is raised that is of public importance; or involves a conflict between courts; or [...] "is {{in the interests of}} the administration of justice". Therefore, while the High Court is the <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant special leave to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges).

As of 2005, Barbados replaced the process <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> to Her Majesty in Council with the CCJ, which had then come into operation. The Republic of Guyana also enacted local legislation allowing the CCJ to have jurisdiction over their sovereign <b>final</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> system.
