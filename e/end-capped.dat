50|$|Telechelic {{oligomer}} approach {{applies the}} usual polymerization manner except that one includes a monofunctional reactant to stop reaction at the oligomer stage, generally in the 50-3000 molecular weight. The monofunctional reactant not only limits polymerization but end-caps the oligomer with functional groups capable of subsequent reaction to achieve curing of the oligomer. Functional groups like alkyne, norbornene, maleimide, nitrite, and cyanate {{have been used}} for this purpose. Maleimide and norbornene <b>end-capped</b> oligomers can be cured by heating. Alkyne, nitrile, and cyanate <b>end-capped</b> oligomers can undergo cyclotrimerization yielding aromatic structures.|$|E

50|$|Like all {{siloxanes}} (e.g., hexamethyldisiloxane), {{the polymer}} backbone consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms (...Si−O−Si−O−Si...).

Many silicone liquids are linear polymers <b>end-capped</b> with trimethylsilyl groups. Other silicone liquids are cyclosiloxanes.|$|E
50|$|PLGA degrades by {{hydrolysis}} of its ester linkages in {{the presence}} of water. It has been shown that the time required for degradation of PLGA is related to the monomers ratio used in production: the higher the content of glycolide units, the lower the time required for degradation as compared to predominantly lactide materials. An exception to this rule is the copolymer with 50:50 monomers ratio which exhibits the faster degradation (about two months). In addition, polymers that are <b>end-capped</b> with esters (as opposed to the free carboxylic acid) demonstrate longer degradation half-lives.|$|E
5000|$|Long polyyne {{chains are}} said to be {{inherently}} unstable in bulk because they can cross-link with each other in an exothermal (indeed explosive) reaction. [...] Explosions are a real hazard in this area of research. They can be fairly stable, even against moisture and oxygen, if they are <b>end-capped</b> with suitable inert groups (such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl) rather than hydrogen atoms, especially bulky ones that can keep the chains apart. [...] In 1995 the preparation of carbyne chains with over 300 carbons was reported using this technique. However the report has been contested by a claim that the detected molecules were fullerene-like structures rather than long polyynes.|$|E
50|$|The non-aqueous Li-air {{batteries}} {{were demonstrated}} first (Abraham and Jiang 1996). They usually {{use the same}} mixed ethylene carbonate+ propylene carbonate solvents with LiPF6 or Li bis-sulfonimide salts like the conventional lithium-ion batteries, however, with a gelled rather than liquid electrolyte. (Imanishi, Matsui, et al. 2014) The voltage difference upon constant current charge and discharge is usually between 1.3 and 1.8 V (with an OCP of ca. 4.2 V) even at such ridiculously low currents as 0.01-0.5 mA/cm² and 50-500 mA/g of C on the positive electrode (see Fig. 2 as an example), (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, McCloskey, Burke, et al. 2015, Liu, Xu, et al. 2016). However, the carbonate solvents do evaporate and get oxidized due to a high overvoltage upon charge, (Lu and Amine 2013) and other solvents, such as <b>end-capped</b> glymes, DMSO, dimethylacetamide, and ionic liquids, have been considered. (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014) Carbon cathode also gets oxidized above +3.5 V v Li during charge forming Li2CO3, which leads to an irreversible capacity loss (Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014).|$|E

The use of functional aluminum alkoxides, Et 2 AlOCH 2 X with X = CH 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 and (CH 2) 10 Br, has led to X functional <b>end-capped</b> star-branched polyesters.

TCNR 3 TTPA showed a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (- 5. 60 eV) and broad absorption. The solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on TCNR 3 TTPA:PC 61 BM (1 : 1, w/w) exhibited a high open-circuit voltage (V (oc)) of 0. 99 V, a short-circuit current density (J (sc)) of 5. 76 mA/cm(2), and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2. 50 % under the illumination of AM 1. 5 G, 100 mW/cm(2).

The aggregation behaviors of these C(60) <b>end-capped</b> polymers {{in aqueous solution}} were examined using potentiometric and conductometric titrations and static and dynamic light scattering as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both PAA-C(60) and C(60) -PAA-C(60) show pH-responsive and water-soluble properties at high pH. Both polymers self-assemble to form large compound micelles (LCMs) in aqueous solutions. The LCMs of PAA-C(60) exist as "compact aggregates", whereas the LCMs of C(60) -PAA-C(60) possess a "core-shell" structure with a larger size and aggregation number. The micelles for both polymers swell upon neutralization, where the R(h) of PAA-C(60) micelles increases from approximately 44 to approximately 102 nm and the R(h) of C(60) -PAA-C(60) aggregates varies from approximately 89 to approximately 128 nm with increasing degree of neutralization. The lower swelling of the dual <b>end-capped</b> C(60) -PAA-C(60) system is related to its higher C(60) content, which enhances the interpolymer chain hydrophobic association that restrains the swelling of micellar aggregates.

40|$|The surface {{structure}} and stability (the resistance to surface reconstruction) of <b>end-capped</b> poly(methyl methacrylate) films were greatly {{affected by the}} solvents used for film preparation. Films of <b>end-capped</b> PMMA with about four 2 -perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate units cast with benzotrifluoride solution exhibited excellent stability and resistance to polar environments compared with those cast with cyclohexanone and toluene solutions. The observed difference in stability between these fluorinated surfaces is attributed to their surface microstructures formed during the film formation processes, which {{are closely related to}} the associative behavior of the <b>end-capped</b> PMMA in the solution. A relatively perfect close-packed and well-ordered structure of the perfluoroalkyl side chains at the surface of the PMMA(857) -ec-FMA(3. 3) film was formed when the film was cast with benzotrifluoride solution, in which only unimers existed. This study indicates that such a solvent effect may be used to promote the formation of a well-ordered packing structure of the fluorinated moieties at the film surface. The ordering of the packing structure is to a certain extent more important than the content of the fluorinated moieties at the surface for improving the surface stability. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Their photophysical properties were investigated systematically via spectroscopic and theoretical methods. Both compounds exhibit strong 1 π–π⁎ transitions in the UV region and intense 1 π–π⁎/intramolecular charge transfer (1 ICT) absorption bands in the UV–vis region. Introducing the carbazole <b>end-capped</b> phenylene ethynylene arm on the 1, 3, 5 -triazine core causes a slight bathochromic shift and enhanced {{molar extinction coefficient}} of the 1 π–π⁎/ 1 ICT transition band. Both compounds are emissive in solution at room temperature and 77 K, which exhibit pronounced positive solvatochromic effect.

The high emission quantum yields (Φem= 0. 90 ~ 1. 0) of 1 a and 1 b (in hexane and toluene) make them potential candidates as efficient light-emitting materials.
