Industrial trials were developed with conventional raw clinker, used as a reference material and {{with the addition of}} grits <b>and</b> <b>dregs,</b> 0. 25 % and 0. 13 %, respectively. All raw meals were fired at 1400 ? 1500 °C. Chemical composition of the final mixtures, gaseous emissions quality during clinker production and leaching behaviour of the final products were evaluated. The results show that such incorporation could be an effective process for waste management from both the environmental and economic points of view...|$|R

All of decay, wreck, and foulness gathered in the long circuit of mining-camp and settlement, all the <b>dregs</b> <b>and</b> refuse of a crude and wanton civilization, reappeared for an instant, and then were hurried away in the darkness and lost. No wonder that as the wind ruffled the yellow waters the waves seemed to lift their unclean hands toward the rock whereon the fallen man lay, as if eager to snatch him from it, too, and hurry him toward the sea.|$|R
