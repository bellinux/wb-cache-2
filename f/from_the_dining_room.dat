5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E

25|$|Hearst's guests {{could drive}} in, fly in and land at an {{adjacent}} landing strip, {{or they could}} arrive by horseback after a full day's ride from San Simeon. Guests included Spencer Tracy, Dick Powell, Will Rogers, Clark Gable, Herbert Hoover, Jean Harlow, Leslie Howard and Errol Flynn. Hearst's paramour, Marion Davies, stayed {{in one of the}} four tower suites when she visited. Californio-style fiestas were thrown in the guests' honor, complete with mariachis playing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> balcony.|$|E

50|$|Carol Truax wrote or edited over 20 cookbooks, {{including}} many for Woman's Day and Ladies Home Journal {{and was a}} regular contributor to Gourmet magazine.

25|$|Freed from {{smoke and}} dirt, {{the living room}} thus began {{to serve as an}} area for social {{functions}} and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the servants, and the kitchen was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.|$|E
25|$|Although the Ilmatar {{was built}} as a two-class ship, she had only one dining room that was used by both classes. Other {{facilities}} included a first-class smoking room, located one deck higher <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> As built she had six passenger-accessible decks. The 1973 lengthening saw the addition of several new cabins, a children's playroom and a new waste processing plant. More cabins were added during a 1974 refit at the Valmet shipyard in Vuosaari. In the 1979 conversion into a cruise ship more luxurious cabins were added and a swimming pool was constructed on the rear deck.|$|E
25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons {{over the heads}} of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and with the sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E

50|$|On March 5, 1980 two {{residents}} of Río Negro {{who were in}} Pueblo Viejo were accused of stealing beans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> dam workers. They were pursued by two soldiers and {{an officer of the}} Policia Militar Ambulante (PMA). Upon arrival at Río Negro, the two residents began shouting that they were pursuing the military. The soldiers were rounded up and taken to the church. A community member, who was drunk, struck the officer of the PMA, who, in his eagerness to defend himself, shot and killed seven people. Immediately, the farmers reacted with stones and machetes and killed the agent. One of the soldiers, seeing the reaction of the crowd and his companion dying, left the gun and fled. The other soldier was withheld for a while, and was later freed.|$|R
50|$|The Quakers in Great Ayton {{set aside}} {{part of the}} meeting house as an 'Old Scholars' room {{containing}} many items selected by Old Scholars to be retained as mementoes of the School. The War Memorial plaque <b>from</b> <b>the</b> School <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is placed there while the memorial benches remain in the meeting room.|$|R
500|$|Because of a {{potential}} liability for £10,000 of renovation work upon the expiry of the lease, Betjeman considered the house too costly to maintain, and subsequently vacated it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood empty and suffered vandalism and neglect. [...] A survey undertaken in January 1965 revealed that the exterior stonework was badly decayed, dry rot had eaten through the roof and the structural floor timbers, and the attics were infested with pigeons. Vandals had stripped the lead from the water tanks and had damaged the mirrors, fireplaces and carving work. The most notable loss was the theft of the carved figure of Fame <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> chimneypiece. Betjeman suggested that the owner's agents had deliberately refused to let the house, and allowed it to decline, intending to demolish it and redevelop the site. Writing in Country Life in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took a different view saying that [...] "the Ilchester Estate, upon which the house is situated, are anxious {{that it should be}} preserved and [...] entered into a long lease conditional upon the house being put into a state of good repair." [...] In March 1965, the Historic Buildings Council obtained a preservation order on the house, enabling the purchaser of the lease, Lady Jane Turnbull, daughter of William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford, to initiate a programme of restoration the following July. These renovations were supported by grants of £4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and £3,000 from the Greater London Council. [...] The lease was sold in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel's {{interior}} {{consists of}} a hallway {{which leads to a}} lobby, a lounge, the lone interior guest room, and a 128-capacity dining room (the dining room is in the stem of the [...] "T"). [...] The rear kitchen wing is accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and from the outside. [...] Along with the kitchen, the rear wing includes a room once reserved for the hotel's cook. [...] Private baths were added to most of the guest rooms in the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{towards the}} stern on the boiler deck was the ladies saloon, which {{included}} six rooms, painted {{in a different}} color <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> [...] One of the rooms had been fitted up as a ladies toilet, in which the pumps kept “continuous jets of water playing, while the boat is in motion, so that no offensive effluvia taints these sumptuous cabins.” [...] During winter, this area was heated by a steam radiator covered a marble slab. [...] At night the room was lit by nickel-plated lamps.|$|E
50|$|The chapel has leadlight lancet windows {{along the}} south wall, and a lancet-shaped timber-panelled door which opens into a small vestry at the {{southwest}} end. The chapel is separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> by folding timber (cedar) doors, which can be opened to extend {{the area of the}} chapel. There is a fine marble fireplace-surround with early tiles in <b>the</b> former <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and an early hearth and grate.|$|R
50|$|The library {{has moved}} over <b>the</b> years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hotel <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> to <b>the</b> Town Hall, to above the Fire Hall, to the Community Centre, {{to the former}} Recreation Office on 51st Avenue, and {{ultimately}} to its present location in Forest Green Plaza. The Stony Plain Women's Institute sponsored the library when it came under the Alberta Libraries Act in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} typically {{comes from}} a village hall or other public venue somewhere in Britain, or occasionally further afield, {{such as in the}} Republic of Ireland or northern France. GQT often records at special locations throughout the UK including on a moving train, on top of Snowdon, <b>from</b> inside <b>the</b> Tower of London and in December 2016 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at 10 Downing Street.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{the house}} was {{demolished}} a sale was held {{and parts of the}} house were re-used elsewhere. [...] The large chimneypiece <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> went to form part of the entrance to what is now a restaurant in Borough Road, Birkenhead. [...] Another immense fireplace was reused at [...] Portmeirion as the main facade of a building, the Pantheon. [...] Parts of other chimneypieces went to private houses in Heswall and Bebington, and other piece s went to Llandudno, and to Iwerne Minster House, in Dorset. [...] A smaller house was later built on the site.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{interior}} woodwork, including complete panelled rooms and staircases and fittings such as chimneypieces secured an avid market among rich Americans. In rare cases, complete houses were disassembled, stone by stone, and reassembled in the US; an example is Agecroft Hall, a Lancashire house sold at auction in 1925, dismantled, crated and shipped across the Atlantic, and then reassembled in Richmond, Virginia. The Carolean staircase from Cassiobury Park has come to rest in the Metropolitan Museum of Art as have elements to reassemble [...] "period rooms", including the Rococo stuccoed plasterwork <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> of the Dashwood seat, Kirtlington Park, the tapestry room from Croome Court and the dining room by Robert Adam from Lansdowne House, London, where the incidence of lost great residences is higher, naturally enough, than anywhere in the countryside.|$|E
2500|$|Thus it {{was that}} in 1929 Basildon Park was {{purchased}} by a property developer, George Ferdinando. who bought the estate as park land. George Ferdinando was 65 when he bought the house and as his children were grown up his wife was unwilling to take on another large house and so he produced a sales notice, the idea being {{to sell the house}} as one lot in America. Encouraged by the then current fashion amongst wealthy American citizens for inhabiting ancient European houses and palazzi, Ferdinando produced a sales brochure advertising Basildon to any American citizen for $1,000,000. For this sum, he promised to [...] "carefully take it down" [...] and [...] "re-erect in America", thus providing an opportunity to [...] "Any patriotic American wishing to benefit his native state by presenting this imposing building … ready for occupation as a private residence, museum, college building or public library." [...] Fortunately he {{had a change of heart}} and decided instead to convert the old sawmill at the top of the park into a house for himself and his wife. George also persuaded one of his sons Eric to return from America where he was a cotton grower with his young family to live in the south pavilion then called the east wing. Eric then oversaw the return of fixtures and fittings such as the stair balustrade, the renovation and running of the house and estate. No evidence is available to say whether it was George Ferdinando, the first Lord Iliffe or the executors of the Morrison estate who sold off the dining room fixtures. However elements <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> have been reused in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and doorcases designed by John Carr are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [...] the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the house}} remains {{substantially}} intact, with original timber wall panelling {{in the public}} rooms, and decorative leadlight windows throughout. Extensive views are obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> and living <b>rooms</b> {{on the eastern side}} of the house.|$|R
5000|$|..... And so {{we return}} to my poor father who died in February 1919 beloved by all, and I succeeded him. It was soon very evident after reading his will and {{consultation}} with the family lawyer, that my old home {{would have to go}} - there was no question about it. The estate had to be split up amongst the seven surviving children, with of course provisions for my mother, so I at once settled to sell Fretherne Court Estate, which had been in my family for say some ninety years. or so, my grandfather having come there as a squarson (squire clergyman) from Richmond. It was very sad, but Fretherne Court had no modern requirements, no central heating, and they said we used to burn a ton of coal a day there - fancy the price now, and of course you could not have got it - no electricity, although my uncle had advocated this so many years before, the kitchens {{about a quarter of a}} mile, or so to speak, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> water supply very indifferent, only one or two bathrooms, and the drainage system - well, I finish with this ..." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{accommodates}} the entrance vestibule, manager's office and private quarters, <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and former sitting room, and public bar. The ground floor plan works off <b>the</b> entrance vestibule <b>from</b> which a fine timber stair {{rises to the}} guest accommodation on <b>the</b> first floor. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> vestibule, <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is entered {{to the left and}} the manager's quarters/office to the right. The vestibule runs through to the rear verandah which accommodates toilets at each end. Partitions to the ground floor rooms are post and rail construction lined with vertical tongue and groove boards. All the public rooms, including the bay window space in the public bar, have decorative pressed metal ceilings, ceiling roses and cornices except the rear section of the public bar where the ceiling is lined with tongue and groove timber boards.|$|R
60|$|Still the library. Ten minutes later. Julia, {{angry and}} miserable, comes in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> {{followed}} by Craven. She crosses the room tormentedly, and throws {{herself into a}} chair.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{hotel to}} have housed a ladies' {{ordinary}} {{is thought to}} be Tremont House, Boston. On November 2, 1833, a restaurant for women referred to as a ladies' ordinary opened in New York City, by the proprietors of a neighbouring establishment called the Clinton Lunch. Isabella Lucy Bird, while travelling in the United States in the mid-19th century, wrote about the American House in Boston that the hotel had an upstairs <b>room</b> separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> called 'The Ladies' Ordinary', [...] "where families, ladies and their invited guests take their meals".|$|R
5000|$|Starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{upper deck}} <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> preacher Reverend Frank [...] "Buzz" [...] Scott leads {{a small group}} of (often unwilling) {{followers}} towards the keel of the ship, trying to avoid the rising water level and other such hazards.

5000|$|At {{ground floor}} level, the {{original}} main {{core of the}} house is made up of four rooms, a central hallway and a staircase.

500|$|The Astoria Hotel {{opened in}} 1897 on the {{southwest}} corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, next door to the Waldorf. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Hardenbergh, at a height of about , with 16 stories, 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms. The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the [...] "pièce de résistance" [...] of the hotel, with a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts. The Astor Dining Room was faithfully reproduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of <b>the</b> mansion which once stood on the site.|$|R
5000|$|The ambiance {{boasts a}} [...] "frills-free Italian vibe." [...] It seats 150.The Union Grill {{is located in}} the bottom floor of the building, and because of its {{location}} {{at the top of a}} hill, part of the floor is below ground. [...] The main entrance leads down a short flight of stairs from Wheeling Street. [...] This rathskeller style entrance is the source of the restaurant's local nickname, [...] "The Down and Under," [...] or [...] "D and U." [...] The bar room is filled with wooden booths, brick walls, and antique furnishings. [...] Other <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> split off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and feature Victorian oak furnishings.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} of reinforced concrete, covered by stucco, {{and has a}} red tile roof. Among {{the features of the}} Maegly House that are often included in Prairie School-style dwellings are decorative corner brackets and ornamental friezes, above and below the second-floor windows. One narrow frieze positioned just below the eaves encircles the entire house except where interrupted at the corners by the decorative brackets. The interior is noteworthy for its use of high-quality Honduran mahogany. Every room in the house has multiple windows, and every ground-floor room opens to a porch or terrace. Downtown Portland and Mount Hood can be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room,</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and kitchen. <b>The</b> home is surrounded by a garden notable for its collection of Japanese maples, planted by Aaron Maegly's wife.
