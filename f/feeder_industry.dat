40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} a {{decision support system}} for pallet utilisation in the sheet <b>feeder</b> <b>industry.</b> Furthermore, the research project has focused on providing an improvement to {{the current system of}} distribution of the customer order onto pallets. The overall research objectives are to: (i) Establish {{the state of the art}} in areas related to the project; (ii) Identify the key variables such as pallet sizes, truck sizes, material features and customers’ requirements for building the pallet utilisation model; (iii) Develop an analytical approach and a prototype system to improve the utilisation of the pallets and the truck volume; (iv) Validate the developed model and prototype system through real-life case studies and expert opinions. A combination of research methodology approaches has been employed in this research study. Firstly, a familiarisation stage has been conducted through comprehensive literature review and visits to the sponsoring company. The second phase was to conduct semi-structured interviews with the shop-floor operators and operations directors to have a better understanding of the business needs. This was combined with measurements of the trucks and the pallets and internal documentation from the company. In this stage, the researcher also distributed questionnaires to other sheet feeder companies to know if the system could be applied also to more companies. In the third phase, the data gathered were analysed for the subsequent development of the system. Then the system has been developed following the logic rules obtained by analysing the data. Finally, the developed model and system has been validated, through real-life case studies and expert opinions. The developed analytical model has been implemented in a prototype system. The developed system comprises a knowledge-based system, material handling modules, databases and user interface. The developed system for pallet utilisation encompasses pallet database, truck database and material features databases. The developed model and system has the capability to estimate the number of corrugated cardboard sheets that should be loaded per pallet. Additionally the system predicts the number of sheets per stack and the type of pallet that should be used. The system provides the shop-floor operators with an effective tool for pallet utilisation in order to reduce their decision time. Therefore, the developed system provides cost and time savings in terms of improvements of the pallet and vehicle volume utilisation for the preparation and delivery of the corrugated board product. This system has given to the sponsoring company an improvement of 5 % in the way of orders’ management...|$|E

Materials and energy are put together in order to produce goods and the total of these physical processes have been referred by Ayres and Simons as 2 ̆ 2 Industrial Metabolism 2 ̆ 2, which was defined as 2 ̆ 2 the whole integrated collection of physical processes that convert raw materials, plus labour, into finished products and wastes in a (more or less) steady-state condition 2 ̆ 2. A good understanding of societal metabolism is likely to contribute to more sustainable production and consumption. The construction industry and its related materials, service, and supply <b>feeder</b> <b>industries</b> are jointly considered to be both the world's largest industrial employer and the largest natural resources consumer as well as a great waste producer. In developing countries, construction waste is becoming a serious environmental problem due to the continuing growing population and urbanization, which demand material resources, water and energy. Information and data about the sector in those economies is scarce and some of the information found can't be compared with other data. An assessment has been done in Costa Rica in order to understand how construction materials are metabolised (transformed) by the sector. The study provides an idea of the amount of waste generation and its composition.

50|$|Since little {{progress}} in the bombing campaign was being made, General Arnold recalled General Hansell and moved General Curtis LeMay from the inactivating XX Bomber Command in India to take over XXI Bomber Command on Saipan. General LeMay arrived in the Marianas on 20 January 1945. General LeMay had analyzed {{the structure of the}} Japanese economy, which depended heavily on cottage industries housed in cities close to major industrial areas and issued new orders on 19 February. His plan was to destroy the <b>feeder</b> <b>industries,</b> that would slow or halt the flow of vital components to the central manufacturing plants, and disorganize the production of weapons vital to Japan. LeMay decided to do this by using incendiary bombs rather than purely high-explosive bombs, which would, it was hoped, cause general conflagrations in large cities like Tokyo or Nagoya, spreading to some of the priority targets. In addition, LeMay had concluded that the effects of the jet stream, cloud cover, and high operating altitudes were to blame for the failure of the B-29 raids to do any significant damage to the Japanese war industry. The initial raids against Japan had taken place at high altitudes in order to stay above anti-aircraft fire and the effective altitude of defending fighters. LeMay suggested that high-altitude, daylight attacks be phased out and replaced by low-altitude, high-intensity incendiary raids at nighttime. The aircraft would attack individually, which meant that no formation assembly over the base {{at the start of the}} mission or along the way would be needed. This would extend the range of the aircraft and allow them to reach targets in northern Honshu and Hokkaido.|$|R

Over the previous 12 month period, we have conducted multiple training programs (under the heading of the ISU Master Hoof Care Program) on foot care and claw trimming to trimmers and dairy farm managers throughout the United States. As profit margins on feeder cattle improve, we anticipate that there will be increased demand for foot care services by the <b>feeder</b> cattle <b>industry.</b> For this to happen, a few gaps in our current understanding of lameness in feeder cattle must be addressed. For example, what are the predominant lameness problems in feedlot cattle, what are the underlying causes, {{what can we do about}} them and at what cost? For example, are lameness disorders sufficient to justify the expense of foot care facilities, equipment and training of hospital crews...|$|R

S. <b>feeder</b> cattle <b>industry</b> is intensively competitive, so that market {{efficiency}} suggests feeder cattle prices should fully reflect feed prices {{and information on}} future fed cattle prices. Employing a long time series (1979 - 2004) of feeder cattle futures, live cattle futures, and local corn prices, we test whether complete pass-through occurs. The results indicate that an increase of a dollar per hundred pounds in the live cattle price leads to an increase of approximately $ 1. 48 per hundred pounds in the feeder cattle price in one month, about 93 % of complete pass-through. The corresponding negative effect of a corn price increase is about 87 % of complete pass-through. By contrast with agricultural land markets, the results support the hypothesis of Ricardian rent extraction by the scarce asset owner in feeder cattle markets. The results also provide evidence in favor of informational efficiency in futures markets. feeder cattle, futures market efficiency, live cattle, structural change. ...|$|R

40|$|Parts orienting, {{the process}} of {{bringing}} parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is {{an important aspect of}} automated assembly. Bowl <b>feeders</b> used in <b>industry</b> rely on a sequence of mechanical operations, without using sensors, to orient parts. In our work, we use partial information sensors along with mechanical operations to eliminate uncertainty in part orientation. We show that sensorbased orienting plans need O(m) operations, where m is the maximum number of states with the same sensor value. We characterize the relation between part shape, orientability, and recognizability to identify conditions under which a single plan can orient and recognize multiple part shapes. We describe implemented planners and experiments to demonstrate generated plans. 1 Introduction A parts orienting system must bring randomly oriented parts to goal orientations for assembly. Bowl feeders, widely used in industry, rely on mechanical operations to orient parts (Boothroyd et al. [4 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing traditional (e. g. vibratory bowl) feeders for singulating and orienting industrial parts. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} prototype new designs using analytically- and geometrically-based methods. We have developed a tool for designing industrial parts feeders based on dynamic simulation. Our tool allows us to automatically perform multiple feeder design experiments, and to evaluate their outcomes. These results can then be used to compute the probabilities of a Markov model for the feeder. To demonstrate our technique, we present preliminary results for the design of two simple feeders. Our findings suggest that using dynamic simulation is a promising approach for designing parts feeders. 1 Introduction Vibratory bowl feeders and hopper <b>feeders</b> have proliferated <b>industry</b> as a cost-effective means for reliably orienting parts.

This paper describes the use of dynamic simulation to expedite the design and prototyping of parts feeders.

Our findings show strong similarities between the results of the two types of experiments. We believe that dynamic simulation is a promising approach for expediting the parts feeder analysis and design process. 1 Introduction Although the vibratory parts <b>feeders</b> used in <b>industry</b> to sort and orient parts are quite reliable, their design is timeconsuming. This is largely due to the trial-and-error nature of the design process. Wewould like to use dynamic simulation to expedite the efficient and effective desig [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{relates to}} a study of {{abnormal}} conditions on a threephase distribution <b>feeder</b> of <b>industry</b> like State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) with several loads and a capacitor bank. An induction generator, which {{plays the role of}} a dispersed storage and generation unit, driven by a hydraulic turbine, which is a common form of renewable energy scheme, is connected to the distribution feeder through a Δ/Y transformer. Transients caused switching of the induction generator, by single line-to-ground fault, double line-to-ground fault through contact resistances, broken conductor touching the ground through a small resistance, isolating the induction generator to form its own supply domain (islanding) etc are investigated and interesting conclusions of practical importance are derived. The IBM PC version 4 of the Electro-Magnetic-Transient Program - Alternative Transient Program (ATP), was used to solve this problem. The program also gives output results for automatic plotting in time domain. Accordingly, transient voltages at several nodes and transient currents at interesting points were plotted from the output results. Planning and operational aspects like voltage control, reliability, harmonics, earthing, and contractual matters between the private generator and the utility are also considered. Technical aspects interconnections between the private generation and the utility has been considered. Interesting conclusions, valuable for insulation co-ordination, interrupting duty on circuit breakers, effect on response of protective relays and automatic control systems are pointed out. It also considers security to personnel and protection of metering equipment. The thesis also offers guide for contractual matters between the utility and the private generation...|$|R
