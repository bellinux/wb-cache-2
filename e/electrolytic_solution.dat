40|$|ABSTRACT The {{transport}} of liquid across charged porous membranes separating two <b>electrolytic</b> <b>solutions</b> of different composition consists {{of both a}} normal and an anomalous osmotic component. Anomalous osmosis does not occur with electroneutral membranes. Thus, with membranes which can be charged and discharged reversibly, normal osmosis can be measured with the membrane in the electroneutral state, and normal together with anomalous osmosis with the membrane in a charged state, {{the difference between these}} two effects being the true anomalous osmosis. Data are presented on the osmotic effects across an oxyhemoglobin membrane in the uncharged state at pH 6. 75 and in two charged states, positive at pH 4. 0 and negative at pH 10. 0, in multisolute systems with 0. 2 and 0. 4 osmolar solutions of a variety of electrolytes and of glucose against solutions of other solutes of the same, one-half, and twice these osmolarities. In the simpler systems the magnitude of the true anomalous osmosis can be predicted semiquantitatively by reference to appropriate singlesolute systems. In isoosmolar systems with two <b>electrolytic</b> <b>solutions</b> the anomalous osmotic flow rates may reach 300 #l. /cm. 2 hr. and more; systems with <b>electrolytic</b> <b>solutions</b> against solutions of glucose can produce twice this rate.

40|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> <b>solutions</b> contain mobile ions {{that can}} pass current, and are {{essential}} components of any solution-phase electrochemical system. The Nernst–Planck–Poisson equations describe the electrodynamics and transport dynamics of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>solutions.</b> This thesis applies modern numerical and mathematical techniques {{in order to}} solve these equations, and hence determine the behaviour of electrochemical systems involving charge transport. The following systems are studied: a liquid junction where a concentration gradient causes charge transport; an ideally polarisable electrode where an applied potential difference causes charge transport; and an electrochemical cell where electrolysis causes charge transport. The nanometre Debye length and nanosecond Debye time scales are shown to control charge separation in <b>electrolytic</b> <b>solutions.</b> At equilibrium, charge separation is confined to within a Debye length scale of a charged electrode surface. Non-equilibrium charge separation is compensated in solution on a Debye time scale following a perturbation, whereafter electroneutrality dictates charge transport. The mechanism for the recovery of electroneutrality involves both migration and diffusion, and is non-linear for larger electrical potentials. Charge separation is an extremely important consideration on length scales comparable to the Debye length. The predicted features of capacitive charging and electrolysis at nanoelectrodes are shown to differ qualitatively from the behaviour of larger electrodes. Nanoscale charge separation can influence the behaviour of a larger system if it limits the overall rate of mass transport or electron transfer. This thesis advocates the use of numerical methods to solve the Nernst–Planck–Poisson equations, {{in order to avoid}} the simplifying approximations required by traditional analytical methods. As this thesis demonstrates, this methodology can reveal the behaviour of increasingly elaborate electrochemical systems, while illustrating the self-consistency and generality of fundamental theories concerning charge transport. </p...|$|R
