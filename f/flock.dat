40|$|This paper investigates {{cooperative}} <b>flocking</b> {{control design}} with connectivity preserving mechanism. During <b>flocking,</b> interagent distance is measured to determine communication topology of the <b>flocks.</b> Then, cooperative <b>flocking</b> motion {{is built based on}} cooperative artificial potential field with connectivity preserving mechanism {{to achieve the}} common <b>flocking</b> objective. The <b>flocking</b> control input is then obtained by deriving cooperative artificial potential field using control Lyapunov function. As a result, we prove that our <b>flocking</b> protocol establishes group stabilization and the communication topology of multiagent <b>flocking</b> is always connected...|$|R

5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole <b>flock.</b> The angered Spearow <b>flock</b> gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the <b>flock</b> of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow <b>flock</b> approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E

5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit.

40|$|Faecal samples (n = 1786) from {{chickens}} in broiler breeder (n = 28), layer (n = 22) or broiler (n = 19) <b>flocks</b> in {{the eastern}} states of Australia were cultured for intestinal spirochaetes. Overall, birds in 42. 9 % of broiler breeder and 68. 2 % of layer <b>flocks</b> were colonized with spirochaetes, but no birds in broiler <b>flocks</b> were infected. Colonization rates in infected <b>flocks</b> ranged from 10 to 100 % of birds sampled. Faeces from colonized <b>flocks</b> were on average 14 % wetter than those from non-colonized <b>flocks.</b> There was a highly significant association between colonization with spirochaetes and the occurrence of wet litter and/or reduced production. A subset of 57 spirochaete isolates from birds in 16 <b>flocks</b> were identified to the species level using a panel of polymerase chain reaction tests. Isolates from nine (56 %) of these <b>flocks</b> were spirochaetes that {{are known to be}} pathogens of poultry: Serpulina pilosicoli was isolated from birds from five <b>flocks,</b> birds from two <b>flocks</b> were infected with Serpulina intermedia, and in two other <b>flocks</b> both species were identified. Isolates from the other seven <b>flocks</b> belonged to other Serpulina species, which are currently of unknown pathogenicity. This study indicates that infections with intestinal spirochaetes are a common but currently under-diagnosed cause of wet litter and/or reduced egg production in broiler breeder and layer <b>flocks</b> in Australia...|$|R

This paper introduces a distributed robot <b>flocking</b> system with similar behaviour to biological <b>flocking</b> systems.

5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw <b>flock</b> that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the <b>flock,</b> became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the <b>flock.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} largely solitary or seen in pairs or small family groups of 4-5, and <b>flocks</b> are rare.

In more arid areas, most of the <b>flocks</b> occur in the summer when few wetlands are remaining, whereas in areas with more water, <b>flocks</b> occur largely in winter after chicks have fledged from nests.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{hydrodynamic}} {{model for the}} interactions between collision-free Cucker-Smale <b>flocking</b> particles and a viscous incompressible fluid. Our proposed model consists of two hydrodynamic models. For the Cucker-Smale <b>flocking</b> particles, we employ the pressureless Euler system with a non-local <b>flocking</b> dissipation, whereas for the fluid, we use the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These two hydrodynamic models are coupled through a drag force, which is the main <b>flocking</b> mechanism between the particles and the fluid. The <b>flocking</b> mechanism between particles is regulated by the Cucker-Smale model, which accelerates global <b>flocking</b> between the particles and the fluid. We show that this model admits the global-in-time classical solutions, and exhibits time-asymptotic <b>flocking,</b> provided that the initial data is appropriately small.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy based leader-follower <b>flocking</b> system. To maintain {{the distance between}} robots, we use a fuzzy logic controller to design a "force function" which {{is related to the}} relative distance between neighbours. The "force function" is used to control velocity of robots. To prove stability of the <b>flocking</b> system, we build a Hamilton function which is kinetic energy of the <b>flocking</b> system. Utilizing the LaSalle's invariance principle, we prove that the system is stable. Specially, we develop a <b>flocking</b> controller in local form. By using the local controller, the robots in the <b>flocking</b> system only need to know local information (relative distances and relative angles between neighbours). To evaluate performance of the <b>flocking</b> system, we simulate the <b>flocking</b> system tracking trajectories with different shapes. The local <b>flocking</b> algorithm is tested with three Pioneer robots. We use the SICK laser scanner to measure the relative distances and relative angles between neighbours. © 2009 John Wiley and Sons Asia Pte Ltd and Chinese Automatic Control Society...|$|R
40|$|The swarm {{intelligence}} {{is becoming a}} hot topic.
