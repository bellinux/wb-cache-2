The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to devote the {{resources}} required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day. The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.|$|E
5|$|Launch and Early Orbit Phase {{operations}} were {{completed in the}} morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, the spacecraft returned its first scientific data. Initial data on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet Symposium on 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. The spacecraft underwent six months of on-orbit testing and commissioning, which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found the spacecraft was operating as expected, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to begin operations.|$|E

5|$|Concentrating at Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in {{the early}} months of 1943 the 2/33rd was reorganised as part of the 7th Division's {{conversion}} to the jungle divisional establishment. As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier platoon, receiving in its place a machine gun platoon equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft platoon was re-roled as a tank-attack platoon and the transport platoon was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received a batch of around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua–Lae campaign.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the rest}} of the 3rd Division had been {{progressively}} sent to New Caledonia where it underwent further combat training. The 34th Battalion, its duties on Tongatapu at an end, joined the division in March 1943. In July 1943, Barrowclough informed the New Zealand Government that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for combat duties, so in early September 1943, it moved to Guadalcanal for a combat role as part of the Solomon Islands campaign. However along the way, the troops stopped briefly at Port Vila in the New Hebrides to carry practice amphibious operations with landing craft before continuing onto Guadalcanal. Arriving off their destination on 14 September, the battalion was landed the same day. Jungle training remained the focus of the battalion although they also took the opportunity to work with Valentine tanks.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to shop {{around to the}} studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer {{had a difficult time}} getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only able to offer the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E

5|$|On 27/28 February 1942 33 bombers {{flew over}} Wilhelmshaven looking for Scharnhorst. Cloud {{obscured}} the target area and German reports noted only three explosions. Three Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers were lost to unstated causes. In 1942 Scharnhorst had evaded the worst attacks from RAF Bomber Command. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for redeployment by the summer, but {{a series of}} accidents, such as striking a mine and running aground meant this was delayed until the turn of the year. The ship made three unsuccessful attempts to sail to Norway. On 10 January 1943 she was spotted by RAF aircraft and turned back after reaching only the Skagerrak. Another attempt was tried in January but failed. On 3 March 1943 Scharnhorst finally made it to Norway. She would survive another eight months before being sent on her last wartime mission, Operation Ostfront. During her sortie Scharnhorst was sunk at the Battle of the North Cape.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a {{light rail}} system on Portland's west side started in 1979, with a {{groundbreaking}} coming in 1993 on the Westside MAX project. The line originally was to terminate at Willow Creek/185th, but lobbying by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman and others secured funding to extend the line to downtown. Plans for the station originally called {{for the construction of}} a branch of the Hillsboro Public Library at the stop. Due to cost overruns when building the Robertson Tunnel through the West Hills, the library was canceled and a Books by Rail program was added to the Hillsboro Central station. TriMet also canceled plans for security cameras at the station. The park-and-ride lot opened on March 3, 1997, served by two bus lines (61 and 88), because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for use. The original planned opening date of September 1997 for Westside MAX as far as 185th Avenue had been postponed by one year, due to delays in constructing the Robertson Tunnel, resulting in Willow Creek park-and-ride's being completed far in advance of the start of MAX service and related bus-service expansion.|$|E
5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E

A fourth Beta process building, 9204-4, was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945. A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. Along with these main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures. There were two steam plants for heating, and a power plant for electricity.|$|E
