40|$|One of {{analysis}} methode that is use to evaluate construction project management {{in order to}} minimize cost, work optimation & time efectivity with also care about the project quality is by using value engineering. The main reason to use this Analysis methode is the systematic and procedural approach in the object evaluation. Stages on the job plan are information stage, creative, analysis & recommendation stages which is the first one is the specify the item with highest cost, then the analyse stage to choose the alternative for the life cycle cost compare & to classifiet the main & seconding functional to get cost/wort ratio. Is the result of this engineering analysis is cost minim for example on the foundation work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 125. 855. 576, 30. On the concrete slab work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 78. 988. 937, 72. On the nain bean work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 24. 308. 712, 38.

5|$|The running air battles <b>had</b> <b>cost</b> the Ju 87 units heavily. The lack of {{protection}} for I./StG 77 <b>had</b> <b>cost</b> it 10 Ju 87s with one damaged beyond repair. Total manpower losses for the unit amounted to 17 killed or mortally wounded, six wounded and five captured out of 56 men. II./StG 77 lost three Ju 87s to fighter attack and one damaged beyond repair, five crewmen dead and one captured. III./StG 77 also lost two Ju 87s and two damaged with four men killed. StG 77s casualties amounted to 26 killed, six taken prisoner, and six wounded. The battles brought {{the number of}} Ju 87s lost thus far in the campaign to 59 with a further 33 damaged. The price was too high and {{with the exception of}} sporadic attacks on convoys later in the year, the Ju 87 played no further part in the Battle of Britain.

5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation {{had little effect on}} the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation <b>had</b> <b>cost</b> the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E
