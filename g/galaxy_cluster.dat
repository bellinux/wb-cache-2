5|$|A {{much larger}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>cluster</b> is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found.

The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911.

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <b>galaxy</b> <b>cluster</b> velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> exhibit {{remarkable}} self-similar behavior {{which allows}} us to establish simple scaling relation-ships between observable quantities and <b>cluster</b> masses, making <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> useful cosmological probes. Recent X-ray observations suggest that self-similarity may be broken in the outskirts of <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters.</b> In this work, we analyze a mass-limited sample of massive <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> from the Omega 500 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to investigate the self-similarity of the diffuse X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters.</b> We find that the self-similarity of the outer ICM profiles is better preserved if they are normalized {{with respect to the}} mean density of the universe, while the inner profiles are more self-similar when normalized using the critical density. However, the outer ICM profiles as well as the location of accretion shock around clusters are sensitive to their mass accretion rate, which causes the apparent breaking of self-similarity in cluster outskirts. We also find that the collisional gas does not follow the distri-bution of collisionless dark matter perfectly in the infall regions of <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters,</b> leading to 10 % departures in the gas-to-dark matter density ratio from the cosmic mean value.

The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese.

40|$|Recent {{data and}} cosmological models {{point to a}} {{significant}} fraction of the Universe being comprised of Cold Dark Matter (DM), though {{little is known about}} it directly as it does not interact electromagnetically. The most likely explanation for DM is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) having a mass as low as ∼ 10 GeV to as high as ∼ 10 TeV. WIMPs are believed to be their own antiparticles and self-annihilate into a variety of lighter particles including γ-rays. Many direct detection, indirect detection, and direct production schemes have been proposed to search for the elusive WIMP. <b>Galaxy</b> <b>clusters,</b> consisting of hundreds to thousands of galaxies, are the largest collections of matter in the Universe held together by gravity. As such, <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> also contain the highest concentrations of DM found anywhere. ^ This thesis presents results on the VERITAS observations of 12 <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> selected from archival data. We seek to detect the γ-rays originating from the DM interactions within <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters.</b> We calculate astrophysical J-factors for each of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> six of which had no prior J-factors with the DM simulations package CLUMPY. Since a DM detection is not made, the limit to the thermally-averaged DM annihilation velocity-weighted cross-section is then computed from the γ-ray flux upper limit. We employ a stacking method to combine the limits of the 12 <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters.</b> The limits from the stacking method are found to be less constraining than some individual <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> due to the wide range of limits considered.

25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of <b>galaxy</b> <b>clusters</b> detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|R
