5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> North Pole.|$|E

5|$|The Barry Goldwater presidential {{campaign}} of 1964 began when United States Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona elected {{to seek the}} Republican Party nomination for President of the United States to challenge incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Early on, before officially announcing his candidacy for the presidency, Goldwater was accused by Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller of attempting to galvanize Southern and Western Republican support while neglecting the industrial northern states, eventually becoming one of Goldwater's primary opponents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party's nomination in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{ended their}} win drought with a 5–3 victory against Portland. After having gone one-for-18 {{on the power}} play in the {{previous}} five games, Hershey scored a season-high five power play goals against the Pirates, including a hat trick by Crabb. Taffe recorded five assists, the team's season-high points total for a single game. Another victory against Adirondack on April 19 placed Herhsey back into playoff contention, tying them with Manchester, Norfolk and Connecticut at 79 points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final two spots. The Bears clinched the eighth and final seed by defeating Manchester 4–2 in their final regular season game on April 21. Taffe finished the regular season the second-highest scorer in the league with 18 goals, finishing behind the Rockford IceHogs' Brandon Pirri at 22 goals. Taffe and Pirri tied for the league high in assists at 53. Taffe was also named the team's Most Valuable Player and made the AHL's 2012-13 second all-star squad. The Bears finished the regular season with a home attendance total of 381,764 and a club-record average of 10,046. This marked only the fifth time an AHL club had averaged more than 10,000 since records started being kept in 1962, {{and the first time}} since the then-Philadelphia Phantoms in 1999–2000. Boyd Kane was named the club's Man of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The Huskies {{proceeded}} to win 25–0 over Arizona State and 45–22 against the University of Arizona Wildcats, with Tyler scoring once in each game. Washington, although unranked at 7–2, was leading <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pac-10 {{spot in the}} Rose Bowl. Only four other teams in the conference were eligible for the appearance, as, in the previous August, the presidents of Pac-10 schools had voted unanimously to disqualify half of the conference's members from Rose Bowl contention because of rules violations. The teams disqualified included UCLA and USC, two of the league's strongest teams. The next week, despite not having Tyler due to injury, Washington beat USC 20–10; this clinched a spot in Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. In the 1981 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, Washington was beaten 23–6. In a scoreless first quarter, it was originally ruled a touchdown when Tyler dove over a pile near the goal line. After the officials conferred, however, {{it was decided that}} Tyler had fumbled at the one-yard line, which he later admitted to.|$|E
