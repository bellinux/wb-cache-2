25|$|After {{completing}} conversion, Matar steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, 28 May for shakedown in Chesapeake Bay. Thence, she loaded cargo at Davisville, Rhode Island, and Bayonne, New Jersey, before departing New York for the Pacific Ocean 25 June, arriving Pearl Harbor 25 July. Matar discharged cargo and refilled her holds with ammunition, <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> and amphibious equipment. Operating under Service Squadron 8, she sailed with {{units of}} task force TF 31 on 20 August for the Palaus.|$|E
25|$|The first soldier ration {{established}} by a Congressional Resolution, during the Revolutionary War, consisted of {{enough food to}} feed a man for one day, mostly beef, peas, and rice. During the Civil War, the military moved toward canned goods. Later, self-contained kits were issued as a whole ration and contained canned meat, bread, coffee, sugar and salt. During the First World War, canned meats were replaced with lightweight preserved meats (salted or dried) to save weight and allow more rations to be carried by soldiers carrying their supplies on foot. At the beginning of World War II, {{a number of new}} <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> were introduced, including the Mountain ration and the Jungle ration. However, cost-cutting measures by Quartermaster Command officials during the latter part of World War II and the Korean War again saw the predominance of heavy canned C rations issued to troops, regardless of operating environment or mission. The use of canned wet rations continued through the Vietnam War, with the improved MCI field ration.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. {{government}} ordered {{huge amounts}} of condensed milk as a <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> for Union soldiers during the war. This was an extraordinary <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> for the 19th century: a typical 10-oz (300-ml) can contained 1,300 calories (5440 kJ), 1 oz (28 g) each of protein and fat, and more than 7 oz (200 g) of carbohydrate.|$|R
5000|$|B-ration: <b>Field</b> <b>Ration.</b> Canned, packaged, or {{preserved}} foods normally {{prepared in}} field kitchens without refrigeration.|$|R
5000|$|The 10-in-1 food parcel, {{commonly}} known as the 10-in-1 <b>ration</b> was a <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> prepared for soldiers of the United States Army, intended to provide one meal for 10 men.|$|R
500|$|Other sources {{place this}} event as {{occurring}} in Alexandria, Egypt during the Egyptian {{campaign against the}} Ottoman Empire. [...] This variant may {{have been inspired by}} Napoleon's letter to General Auguste de Marmont just prior to the 1799 Battle of Abukir when Marmont was in Alexandria. [...] It urged Marmont to provide an attack warning system by securing [...] "a large quantity of dogs which can be made use of by posting them in front of your fortifications". [...] After this event, the Colonel of the grenadier regiment is said to have formally placed Moustache on the roll as a grenadier and gave him a collar bearing the regiment's name. [...] Additionally, he ordered that Moustache receive the <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> entitled to a grenadier and that he be combed by the unit's barber once per week.|$|E
500|$|Sustenance for the UN {{troops in}} Korea {{was among the}} other {{logistical}} challenges confronting the UN {{in the early days}} of the war. There were no C rations in Korea and only a small reserve in Japan at the outbreak of the war. The Quartermaster General of the United States Army immediately began moving all available C rations and 5-in-1 B rations from the United States to the Far East. <b>Field</b> <b>rations</b> at first were largely the less nutritious and palatable World War II K rations. The UN had to rely on much of the US stock of World War II-era material for much of this phase of the war. Provisioning of the ROK troops was an equally important and difficult problem. The regular issue ration to ROK troops was rice or barley and fish. It consisted of about [...] of rice or barley, one half pound of biscuit, and one half pound of canned fish with spices. Often the cooked rice, made into balls and wrapped in cabbage leaves, was sour when it reached the combat troops on the line, and frequently it did not arrive at all. Occasionally, local purchase of foods on a basis of 200 Won ($0.05 USD) per day per man supplemented the issued ration. An improved ROK ration consisting of three menus, one for each daily meal, was ready in September 1950. It provided 3,210 calories, weighed , and consisted of rice starch, biscuits, rice cake, peas, kelp, fish, chewing gum, and condiments, and was packed in a waterproofed bag. With slight changes, this ration was found acceptable to the ROK troops and quickly put into production. It became the standard ration for them during the first year of the war.|$|E
2500|$|Also, a kosher {{variant of}} Spam, known as Loof ( [...] , a Hebrew {{linguistic}} play on meatloaf), {{was produced by}} Richard Levi, and mostly used as part of <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> by the Israel Defense Forces. A Glatt kosher version was also produced. It was phased out of <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> during the early 2000s and was finally removed from rations when production ceased in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The F.R.E.D. or <b>Field</b> <b>Ration</b> Eating Device is a {{combination}} spoon, can opener, and bottle opener included in every CR1M. Australian troops commonly refer to the F.R.E.D. as a 'Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device.' ...|$|R
50|$|The CR1M {{consists}} of two main meals (vacuum packed), a midday snack (chocolate, muesli bar etc.), a number of sundry items (toilet paper, can opener, matches, scouring pad etc.) and a <b>Field</b> <b>Ration</b> Eating Device or F.R.E.D.|$|R

2500|$|The Swedish army also {{employed}} {{a variant of}} this opener, again very similar but not identical. Official designation is M7481-021000 Konservbrytare Mini which was distributed with the infamous [...] "Golden Cans" [...] (Swedish <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> were packaged in metallic tins with a golden hue). In 1924, a similar device was featured in Popular Mechanics, with no mention of a military provenance.|$|E
2500|$|The P-38, {{developed}} in 1942, {{is a small}} can opener that was issued in the canned <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> of the United States Armed Forces from World War II to the 1980s. [...] Originally designed for and distributed in the K-ration, it was later included in the C-ration. As of 2017, it is still in production and sold on a worldwide market.|$|E
2500|$|As a home remedy, saltines are {{consumed}} {{by many people}} in order to ease nausea and to settle an upset stomach. Pregnant women are also usually advised to snack on saltines [...] Saltine crackers have also been included in military <b>field</b> <b>rations</b> (Meal, Ready-to-Eat, or MRE) in the United States. [...] For some children in the eastern United States, Saltines are a traditional Christmas night treat.|$|E
50|$|The Danish {{military}} {{developed a}} modern <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> inspired by Norwegian and American rations. It consist of Drytech freeze-dried main meals and several additional {{items such as}} dried fruits and nuts, energy bars, hard biscuits, meat pate etc.|$|R
50|$|The Combat Ration One Man, or CR1M is a self-contained, {{individual}} <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> in lightweight packaging procured by the Australian {{military for}} its members {{for use in}} combat or other field conditions where organised food facilities are not available.|$|R
50|$|Shelf life {{is often}} {{specified}} {{in conjunction with}} a specific product, package, and distribution system. For example, an MRE <b>field</b> <b>ration</b> is designed to have a shelf life of three years at 80 F and six months at 100 F.|$|R
2500|$|In various {{letters and}} books they {{described}} their time from 1909 to 1913 as [...] "luxurious." [...] They had an indoor riding hall, solid warm barracks, heated barns for their horses, friendly neighbors {{and plenty of}} [...] "wholesome food." [...] Educational opportunities on base and within the community were provided and many men earned higher degrees. When one compares this to building their own barracks, rough frontier living and military <b>field</b> <b>rations,</b> this was heaven on earth for the 10th.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{prominent}} {{innovations in}} the packaging industry were developed first for military use. [...] Some military supplies are packaged {{in the same}} commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport materiel, supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in World War II led to Military Standard or [...] "mil spec" [...] regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated [...] "military specification packaging". As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to operations in Iceland experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, <b>field</b> <b>rations,</b> antistatic bags, and various shipping crates) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.|$|E
2500|$|While in the <b>field,</b> <b>rations</b> for the 33rd (and other Confederate regiments) were cooked {{wherever}} possible {{at a site}} usually located two to five miles in the rear area behind the front lines where the [...] "regimental skillet wagon" [...] was located. Men were periodically assigned to KP duty here, where they chopped wood, carried water and cooked meals. A regimental teamster was assigned to draw rations daily from the nearest railhead; in May 1864 these consisted of one pound of unbolted corn per man per day, or the same weight of flour made of wheat and cowpeas ground together. In addition, each soldier was allotted a half-pound of bacon, or a pound of fresh beef. When this arrangement proved impractical (such as during combat), uncooked rations would be issued, and each soldier was on their own. Unlike modern armies who employ trained cooks, the 33rd made do with troops from the ranks; {{the quality of their}} preparations accordingly varied, with Matthews reporting of one cook: [...] "Co. B didn't make [...] any presents." ...|$|E
50|$|The Soldier Fuel bar, {{formerly}} known as Hooah! bar, is a dairy-based calcium-enriched energy bar created by the United States military in 1996. It was originally provided to military personnel packaged within a <b>field</b> <b>ration,</b> such as the Meal, Ready-to-Eat, Meal Cold Weather, or First Strike Ration.|$|R
5000|$|Chili mac {{has been}} a staple dish at American {{military}} dining facilities for years.
