5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted <b>him</b> <b>right</b> to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} of the viceroyalty {{had suffered}} many casualties lately, {{particularly during the}} native uprisings of Tupac Amaru.

25|$|Rehhagel has popularized {{the phrase}} kontrollierte Offensive (controlled offence). He prefers a grass-roots {{approach}} to football, stressing {{the importance of}} at least two (often also three) big, strong headers in central defence. His defensive schemes often use a dominant libero, such as Rune Bratseth, Miroslav Kadlec, or Traianos Dellas. In defence Rehhagel usually prefers robustness and height over footballing abilities (the most notorious example being Ulrich Borowka). In the period of all-round, fluid defence, many have criticized this as dated and anachronistic, but Rehhagel loves to reply that his success makes <b>him</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity {{to tell him about}} it. At the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up. For his part, he seems very receptive to her relaxed, direct, slightly low-brow, and provocative approach as she seems a polar opposite of his straight-laced girlfriend Branka. While out with Branka one day at a bar, Koka bumps into two of them, saying a flirty hello to Saša followed by a testy chat with Branka who is completely rattled by this encounter.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac's harsh {{criticism}} of his superiors in the Staff Corps overshadowed his impressive ability to avoid envelopment by the Germans, and he was replaced by Louis Franchet d'Espérey just before {{the opening of the}} First Battle of the Marne. Joffre later recorded that ever since the Battle of Guise, Lanrezac’s normal tendency to criticise and argue about his orders had been exacerbated by fatigue, to the detriment of Fifth Army staff’s morale. Lanrezac’s staff were bickering among themselves. As he could not be counted upon for the planned counterstroke, it was necessary to relieve him on the afternoon of 3 September. The eyewitness accounts of Lanrezac (who claimed that he protested that events had proved <b>him</b> <b>right</b> about most of the issues under dispute, but that Joffre refused to meet his gaze, so that {{it was clear that he}} had exhausted Joffre’s confidence), Joffre (who claimed that Lanrezac immediately agreed and cheered up when relieved of command, in his own office) and Spears (who recalled seeing them having a lengthy and strained conversation in the playground of the school where Fifth Army HQ was currently based) differ somewhat.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of the New 52 Superman, Luthor decides to assume Superman's symbol in a new suit of battle-armour (apparently powered by a Mother Box) to protect Metropolis, but he is confronted by the pre-Flashpoint Superman, who refuses to believe that Luthor's {{intentions}} are as noble as he claims. This results in a brief conflict between the two, Luthor claiming that Superman's 'unprovoked' attack proves that he is an impostor while Superman counters that Luthor's brutal response proves <b>him</b> <b>right,</b> but the fight is cut short when Doomsday apparently emerges. Despite Superman's uncertainty about Luthor and Luthor's own beliefs about Superman, Superman convinces Luthor to help him by focusing on evacuating civilians while he deals with Doomsday due to his greater experience. After the crisis is over, Superman talks with Luthor and agrees to let him continue acting as a hero using his logo when Superman concedes that he has no clear evidence that this Luthor has any criminal activity. Luthor is later attacked by an alien warrior who attacks people who, according to visions of the future he receives, will go on to commit various acts of death and violence, but Superman appeals to them to let Luthor free by arguing that the future is always changing and he will do his best to ensure that the dark future they foresaw for Luthor will never come to pass.|$|E

25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly.

Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E
