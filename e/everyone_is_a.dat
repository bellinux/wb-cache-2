500|$|The {{referendum}} {{was held}} in Sjöbo on 18 September 1988, {{the day of the}} Swedish general election, and passed with a 67 percent majority of the votes (6,237 for and 3,000 against), which led to even more criticism from the Swedish population. Then-Prime Minister of Sweden Ingvar Carlsson said the results were [...] "tragic", and the then-leader of the Centre Party, Olof Johansson, called the ban [...] "improper". The result of the referendum led to concerns from the Swedish government that other municipalities would follow in Sjöbo's footsteps. The day after the vote, Madeleine Ramel commented: [...] "This is a sad result. <b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> loser. It is unfortunate for Sjöbo." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} set {{to follow the}} stories of 8–10 playable characters, beginning with an American-Iranian State Department translator trying to free American hostages. This was later reduced to a single character: an aspiring Iranian photojournalist. Khonsari's goal was to allow players to [...] "see {{the world is a}} lot more gray than black and white", achieving this by having a protagonist who experienced the Revolution. The game's characters are based on the interviews conducted with Iranians who experienced the Revolution. Executive producer Vassiliki Khonsari said the characters [...] "do not fall into the typical good guy/bad guy, but <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shade of gray ... to show the complexity of history". The team featured a variety of characters from different families, beliefs and social classes.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with images}} of brutality, ISIL {{presents}} itself as [...] "an emotionally attractive place where people 'belong', where <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 'brother' or 'sister'". The [...] "most potent psychological pitch" [...] of ISIL media is the promise of heavenly reward to dead jihadist fighters. Frequently posted in their media are dead jihadists' smiling faces, the ISIL 'salute' of a 'right-hand index finger pointing heavenward', and testimonies of happy widows. ISIL has also attempted to present a more [...] "rational argument" [...] {{in a series of}} videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist John Cantlie. In one video, various current and former US officials were quoted, such as the then US President Barack Obama and former CIA Officer Michael Scheuer.|$|E
2500|$|Flowing on {{from the}} BK belief that <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> spiritual being, is the {{practice}} of Shubhawna (pure feelings) and Shubkamna (good wishes). For BKs, all prejudices and ill-feelings are seen as arising from identifying the self and others based on external labels like race, religion, gender, nationality, beauty (or lack of), etc. However, when there is the practice of finding the intrinsic goodness in each one, the prejudice based on those labels is replaced by the vision of one Spiritual Parent, one Human family, and universal spiritual values such as respect, love, peace and happiness. A flagship slogan for the BKs has been When we change, the world changes. It {{is for this reason}} that BKs consider bringing about this kind of change within the self as an important form of [...] "world service".|$|E
2500|$|According to Roger Ebert, on {{his review}} of Fat City, [...] "His fascination with underdogs and losers. The {{characters}} in Huston movies hardly ever set out to achieve what they're aiming for. Sam Spade, in The Maltese Falcon, Huston's first film, ends up minus one partner and one woman {{he thought he could}} trust. <b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> loser in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the gold blows back into the dust and is lost in it. Ahab, in Moby Dick. Marlon Brando's career Army officer in Reflections in a Golden Eye, even Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen – they all fall short of their plans. The African Queen does have a happy ending, but it feels tacked-on and ridiculous, and the Queen destroys itself in destroying the German steamer. So this [...] is a theme we find in Huston's work, but rarely does he fit it to characters and a time and place so well as in Fat City. Maybe that's because Huston knows the territory: he was a professional boxer himself for a while, and not a very good one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jacques Pierre Louis Rivette {{was born}} in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, France to André Rivette and Andrée Amiard, into a family [...] "where <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pharmacist". According to {{childhood}} friend André Ruellan, Rivette's father was a skilled painter who loved opera. His younger sister said that their home in Rouen was next to a movie theater, where she remembered watching Pathé Baby's Felix le Chat cartoons with Rivette and their grandparents. Rivette, educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille, said that he briefly studied literature at university [...] "just to keep myself occupied". Inspired by Jean Cocteau's book about the filming of La Belle et la Bête, Rivette decided to pursue filmmaking and began frequenting ciné-clubs. In 1948, he shot his first short film, Aux Quatre Coins, in Rouen's Côte Sainte-Catherine section. The following year, he moved to Paris with friend, Francis Bouchet, because [...] "if {{you wanted to make}} films it was the only way". On the day of his arrival, he met future collaborator Jean Gruault, who invited him to see Les dames du Bois de Boulogne at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin. Éric Rohmer, whose film criticism Rivette admired, gave a talk at the screening.|$|E

After she began penning tracks for the likes of Cher Lloyd, Susan Boyle, Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis who are all signed to Cowell's record label, Syco Music. She also revealed that it was never an option to go out and sing other artists' songs which they had written for her. She wanted the whole album to be her own, and every song to be written by herself. She said [...] "For me to feel empowered by music, it has to be my own. The message that the lyric carries is as important to me as singing in tune. Not <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> writer or wants to be, so shows like that can be a great way of getting exposure – and as we're all aware, this is a tough industry to break into. I just know I'd have found it very difficult to go out and sing other people's songs week after week, though. It simply wouldn't have felt truthful." ...|$|E

60|$|Most of us {{have come}} across the {{practical}} problem of London landladies, {{the problem of the}} doubtful foreign gentleman in a street of respectable English people. Those who have done so can form some idea of what it would be to live in a street full of doubtful foreign gentlemen, in a parish, in a city, in a nation composed entirely of doubtful foreign gentlemen. Old California, {{at the time of the}} first rush after gold, was actually this paradox of the nation of foreigners. It was a republic of incognitos: no one knew who anyone else was, and only the more ill-mannered and uneasy even desired to know. In such a country as this, gentlemen took more trouble to conceal their gentility than thieves living in South Kensington would take to conceal their blackguardism. In such a country everyone is an equal, because <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> stranger. In such a country it is not strange if men in moral matters feel something of the irresponsibility of a dream. To plan plans which are continually miscarrying against men who are continually disappearing by the assistance of you know not whom, to crush you know not whom, this must be a demoralising life for any man; it must be beyond description demoralising for those who have been trained in no lofty or orderly scheme of right. Small blame to them indeed if they become callous and supercilious and cynical. And the great glory and achievement of Bret Harte consists in this, that he realised that they do not become callous, supercilious, and cynical, but that they do become sentimental and romantic, and profoundly affectionate. He discovered the intense sensibility of the primitive man. To him we owe the realisation of the fact that while modern barbarians of genius like Mr. Henley, and in his weaker moments Mr. Rudyard Kipling, delight in describing the coarseness and crude cynicism and fierce humour of the unlettered classes, the unlettered classes are in reality highly sentimental and religious, and not in the least like the creations of Mr. Henley and Mr. Kipling. Bret Harte tells the truth about the wildest, the grossest, the most rapacious of all the districts of the earth--the truth that, while it is very rare indeed in the world to find a thoroughly good man, it is rarer still, rare to the point of monstrosity, to find a man who does not either desire to be one, or imagine that he is one already.|$|E
