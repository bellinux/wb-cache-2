500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The Sunday Mirrors Ian Hyland rated the song {{nine out of}} ten stars and described it as [...] "ure class from the ever-smiling teens". According to AllMusic's Dean Carlson, [...] "Soul Sound" [...] is a representation that [...] "the jitters of youth are [...] though tempered by shrewd ambition and a clever and unpredictable production aesthetic". John Mulvey of NME stated that while the song lacked the quality of the trio's debut single [...] "Overload", it [...] "is pretty good nevertheless". He elaborated, [...] "the best thing about Sugababes is how they sound like they really can't be arsed with anything, let alone any of this pop star business [...] Enough with the dance routines and shit-eating grins – <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> total lack of enthusiasm's the way forward for teen pop?" [...] Stylus Magazine writer Scott Plagenhoef described the single as [...] "marvelous lilting [...] hopeful", while Stephen Robinson from Hot Press was less favourable and criticised the song's pop-rock experimentation, which according to him [...] "doesn't work quite so well". Neil Western of the South China Morning Post felt that [...] "Soul Sound", along with the album's title track, [...] "lack sparkle".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why did you not stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher.

2500|$|Pollard has {{attempted}} to examine the negative views of Crabbe {{and the reasons for}} limited readership since his lifetime: [...] "Why did Crabbe's 'realism' and his discovery of what in effect was the short story in verse fail to appeal to the fiction-dominated Victorian age? Or is it that somehow psychological analysis and poetry are uneasy bedfellows? But then why did Browning succeed and Crabbe descend to the doldrums or to the coteries of admiring enthusiasts? And why have we in this century (the 20th century) failed to get much nearer to him? <b>Does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> that each succeeding generation must struggle to find his characteristic and essential worth? FitzGerald was only one of many among those who would make 'cullings from' or 'readings in' Crabbe.

2500|$|The {{announcement}} {{came as a}} {{shock to}} Italians and non-Italians alike. Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who [...] "does not belong to the traditional academic world." [...] However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic Carlo Bo was mystified: [...] "I must be too old to understand. What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> That everything changes, even literature has changed." [...] Fo's fellow Italian laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian. Mario Luzi, a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed the phone down on one reporter: [...] "I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!" [...] Reaction from the English-speaking world was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. playwright Tony Kushner, however, expressed his approval, writing: [...] " [...] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [...] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect". When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called Contra jogulatores obloquentes (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as [...] "undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy." ...|$|E

And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> you're trying to have a pretext for war?
