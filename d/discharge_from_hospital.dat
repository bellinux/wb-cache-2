500|$|On <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital,</b> Leane {{initially}} {{returned to}} the 11th Battalion, but on 21 February 1916 was transferred to be the commanding officer of the planned 48th Infantry Battalion. The 48th Battalion {{was assigned to the}} 12th Brigade, part of the 4th Division. Leane was substantively promoted to lieutenant colonel on 12 March, and the battalion itself was raised four days later. Like Leane himself, the 48th was both South Australian and Western Australian, having been raised from a cadre drawn from the 16th Battalion reinforced by fresh recruits from Australia. Serving in the battalion were a number of Leane's relatives, including his younger brother, Benjamin Bennett Leane, who was initially his adjutant and later his second-in-command. There were also three of his nephews in the battalion (Allan Edwin, Reuben Ernest and Geoffrey Paul Leane), and several other relatives. The 48th became known throughout the AIF as the [...] "Joan of Arc Battalion" [...] because it was [...] "made of All-Leanes" [...] (Maid of Orleans). Throughout March and April 1916, the battalion undertook training in the desert before being moved to Habieta in early May where they briefly manned defensive positions as a precaution against a possible Ottoman attack on the Suez Canal. On 1 June, after a preliminary march to Serapeum, the battalion was moved by rail to Alexandria and boarded the troopship Caledonia, which sailed for France two days later. They docked at Marseilles on 9 June, after which they were moved to northern France by rail.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study by}} Newman et al. at Duke University Medical Center {{published}} in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) showed an increased incidence of cognitive decline after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), both immediately (53 percent at <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital)</b> and over time (36 percent six weeks, 24 percent at six months, and 42 percent at five years). [...] This study shows an association of neurocognitive decline with CABG, but does not show causation; the study lacks a control group and is considered level II-3 evidence. Also, the statistical calculation of cognitive decline has been demonstrated as the least reliable due to practice effects, measurement error and the regression to the mean phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|Kangaroo care arguably {{offers the}} most {{benefits}} for pre-term and low-birth-weight infants, who experience more normalized temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, increased weight gain, and fewer hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, studies suggest that preterm infants who experience kangaroo care have improved cognitive development, decreased stress levels, reduced pain responses, normalized growth, and positive effects on motor development. Kangaroo care also helps to improve sleep patterns of infants, and {{may be a good}} intervention for colic. Earlier <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> is also a possible outcome Finally, kangaroo care helps to promote frequent breastfeeding, and can enhance mother-infant bonding. Evidence from a recent systematic review supports the use of kangaroo mother care as a substitute for conventional neonatal care in settings where resources are limited." ...|$|E

40|$|Written {{and verbal}} {{information}} versus verbal information only for patients being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> acute <b>hospital</b> settings to home: systematic review A. Johnson 1, 3 and J. Sandford 2 This article {{presents the results}} of a Cochrane review which was conducted to determine the effectiveness of providing written and verbal health information compared with verbal in-formation only to patients being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> acute <b>hospital</b> settings to home. Only two trials met the review inclusion criteria. In both trials the participants were parents of children being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home. The two outcomes measured in both trials were knowledge and satisfaction. The review confirms that providing written and verbal health in-formation is more effective in improving knowl-edge and satisfaction than providing verbal information only for parents of children being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention in adults who provide their own care after dis-charge <b>from</b> <b>hospital.</b> Further research is re-quired which involves adult patients being <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home, and research which measures a range of outcomes which in-clude readmission rates, recovery times, patient/ carer knowledge, complication rates, service utilization and costs (community, outpatient and inpatient), confidence in one’s owncareman-agement, stress and anxiety levels, satisfaction with services provided prior to discharge, and adherence to recommended care...|$|R
