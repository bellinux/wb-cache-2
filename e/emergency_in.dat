30|$|Introduction: Intra-abdominal <b>emergencies</b> <b>in</b> {{gynaecology}} {{have traditionally}} been dealt with by laparotomy, because of the presumed quicker access and therefore safety.

5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to {{structural}} failure while performing an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an <b>emergency.</b> <b>In</b> September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.|$|E
5|$|The Secretaría de Gobernación {{declared}} a state of <b>emergency</b> <b>in</b> 21 of Nuevo León's 51 municipalities, freeing federal disaster funds for use in aid operations. An additional 10 municipalities were placed under the state of emergency on July8. A similar declaration was made for 8 municipalities in Oaxaca, and for 14 municipalities in Tamaulipas; the state of <b>emergency</b> <b>in</b> Tamaulipas was later expanded to 30 municipalities. Mexican President Felipe Calderón requested adding resources to the federal disaster fund, as the $3 billion (2010 MXN; $235 million USD) it held would not be sufficient to face the damage in Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In the months following the storm, a total of $4.8 billion (2010 MXN; $375 million USD) was released by the federal and state governments to aid in the reconstruction of the disaster areas in Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. In Texas, Governor Rick Perry activated the state's search and rescue capabilities in Laredo and San Antonio. This activation was due to the flooding on the Rio Grande Valley, which was expected to worsen due to the approach of Tropical Depression Two to the area affected by Alex.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction.

5|$|Alabama Governor Robert J.

States of emergency were also declared in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma because of the flooding and tornadoes. Following the tornado outbreak on the evening of April 27, President Barack Obama granted a federal emergency declaration for the state of Alabama, giving federal assistance, including search and rescue assets, to the affected region.|$|E
5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call for a state of <b>emergency</b> <b>in</b> the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state of martial law {{in the event of}} a possible military action against Belarus. The President has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the State Secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of <b>emergency</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E

5|$|Formed as {{a fighter}} wing in November 1943, No.78 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at Malta on garrison duties with the Royal Air Force, operating two squadrons of DeHavilland Vampire jet fighters. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, it deployed with Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons to Malaya in 1958–59, flying sorties against communist insurgents in {{the final years of}} the <b>Emergency.</b> <b>In</b> the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, and supplied the equipment and personnel for the RAAF contingent operating from Ubon Air Base in Thailand. No.78 Wing was disbanded in November 1967, and re-formed for its present role as an operational training wing in February 2000.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the British {{government}} requested Australia's {{assistance to}} combat communist insurgents during the Malayan <b>Emergency.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Australian Defence Committee {{determined that it}} was possible to commit a squadron of eight Douglas C-47 Dakota transports and a flight of four to six Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. The Federal government formally announced the decision to send the Dakotas soon afterwards; in late June, it confirmed the allocation of six Lincolns. No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of No.82 Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, and be based at Tengah airfield in the west of Singapore. No.38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Dakotas, would be detached from No.86 Wing at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and be based at Changi, in Singapore's east. The transport commitment was rendered possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service during the Berlin Airlift.|$|E

5|$|In Baldwin County, Alabama, a local {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared on November9 as Ida neared landfall. Voluntary evacuations were declared for residents living along coastal areas or in mobile homes. All government offices were closed until November10 due to the storm. The Baldwin County Coliseum was converted into a shelter to house possible evacuees during the storm as well. In Mississippi, officials advised residents to remain vigilant and discussed possible evacuations. Residents living near Pensacola Beach, Florida, and nearby Perdido Key were urged to evacuate. On November8, emergency officials {{declared a state of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>in</b> Escambia County. The following day, Walton County was also placed under a {{state of emergency}} ahead of Hurricane Ida's arrival. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in low-lying areas and all non-emergency offices were closed until November10. The Freeport High School gymnasium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees.|$|E

In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help.

However, U.S. officials considered using it, {{pointing out that the}} British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan <b>Emergency</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s.
