40|$|The cores of {{electrical}} machines are generally punched and laminated {{to reduce the}} eddy current losses. These manufacturing processes such as punching and cutting deform the <b>electrical</b> <b>sheets</b> and deteriorate its magnetic properties. Burrs are formed due to plastic deformation of <b>electrical</b> <b>sheets.</b> Burr formed due to punching {{on the edges of}} laminated sheets impairs the insulation of adjacent sheet and make random galvanic contacts during the pressing of stacked sheets. The effect of circulating current occurs if the burrs occur on the opposite edges of the stacks of laminated sheets and incase of bolted or wielded sheets, induced current return through it. This induced current causes the additional losses in electrical machine. The existence of surface current on the boundary between two insulated regions causes discontinuity of tangential component of magnetic field. Hence, based on this principle, the boundary layer model was developed to study the additional losses due to galvanic contacts formed by burred edges. The boundary layer model was then coupled with 2 -D finite element vector potential formulation and compared with fine mesh layer model. Fine mesh layer model consists of finely space discretized 950028 second order triangular elements. The losses were computed from two models and were obtained similar at 50 Hz.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} four novel superconducting machine concepts, in {{the pursuit}} of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated <b>electrical</b> <b>sheets,</b> the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3 D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, {{it is much easier to}} replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on-site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6. 6 m and an axial length of 1. 4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB 2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to identify human subjective response (health and comfort) to the micro-thermal environment established by integration of individually controlled localized chilled beam and chilled ceiling (LCBCC) system and to compare its performance {{with the performance of}} mixing ventilation combined with chilled ceiling (CCMV). Experiments were carried out in mock-up of an office (4. 1 m × 4. 0 m × 3. 1 m, L× W× H) with one person under two summer temperature conditions (26 °C and 28 °C). To mimic direct solar radiation in the room, five radiative panels on the wall together with <b>electrical</b> <b>sheets</b> on the half of the floor were used. The test room was set-up with two desks, as two workstations, and one laptop on each table. The main workstation (WS 1) was located close to the simulated window. The second work station (WS 2) was placed in {{the opposite side of the}} room. The room was equipped with two types of ventilating and cooling systems.   The first system consisted of a localized active chilled beam (LCB) unit together with chilled ceiling (CC) panels. The LCB was installed above the WS 1 to create micro-environment around the occupant sitting at the desk. The supply flow rate from the LCB could be adjusted by the occupant within the range of 10 L/s to 13 L/s by means of a desk-mounted knob. The integration of mixing ventilation (MV) system and chilled ceiling panels was the second ventilating and cooling strategy. Twenty- four subjects (12 female and 12 male) were exposed to different indoor environment established by two cooling systems. Each experiment session lasted 120 min and consisted of 30 min acclimatization period and 90 min exposure period. The performance of the systems was identified and compared by physical measurements of the generated environment and the response of the human subjects. The study showed that perceived air quality (PAQ), overall thermal sensation (OTS) acceptability and local thermal sensation (LTS) acceptability clearly improved inside the micro-environment by using LCBCC system. Moreover, at the main workstation, OTS and LTS votes were close to “neutral” thermal sensation (ASHRAE seven point scale) when LCBCC system was used. However, OTS and LTS votes increased to the “slightly warm” side of the scale by applying CCMV system which implied the better cooling performance of the LCBCC system. Acceptability of work environment apparently increased under the room condition generated by LCBCC system. In agreement with human subjective study, the results from physical measurements and thermal manikin study showed that uniform thermal condition was generated all over the room. Air and operative temperature distribution was almost uniform with no difference higher than 1 °C between the measured locations in the room. Thus, both LCBCC and CCMV systems performed equally well outside of the micro-environment region. The use of the chilled ceiling had impact on the airflow interaction in the room and changed the airflow pattern. It can be concluded that the combination of convective and radiative systems can be considered as an efficient strategy to generate acceptable thermal condition in rooms...|$|E
