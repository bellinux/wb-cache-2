5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of}} the war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E

5|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Ontonagon River was built in 1891. It was heavily damaged after {{a fire in the}} village a few years later. This bridge was deemed {{inadequate}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> traffic in Ontonagon in the 1930s. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) contracted for a replacement span in 1939. A temporary crossing was used while the original span was demolished and replaced with a swing bridge. This style of bridge was popular with the department {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, but fell out of favor as the MSHD transitioned to bascule bridges. Because of this change, the Ontonagon River Bridge was the last of its type built in the state when it was completed in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The school offers seven {{undergraduate}} majors {{along with}} MS, MBA and Ph.D. programs. As of the 2014-2015 academic year, there were approximately 3500 undergraduate students and 1300 graduate {{students enrolled in}} the Isenberg School of Management. Isenberg students have wide access to campus resources including over 30 student organizations in the Isenberg School itself, and many more across campus. The school also has a dedicated Chase Career Center, a career and professional development resource tailored especially <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> business students.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

50|$|Animal {{testing in}} the research-based {{pharmaceutical}} industry has been reduced in recent years both for ethical and cost reasons.

5|$|England had {{a diverse}} {{geography}} {{in the medieval}} period, from the Fenlands of East Anglia or the heavily wooded Weald, through to the upland moors of Yorkshire. Despite this, medieval England broadly formed two zones, roughly divided by the rivers Exe and Tees: {{the south and east}} of England had lighter, richer soils, able to support both arable and pastoral agriculture, while the poorer soils and colder climate of the north and west produced a predominantly pastoral economy. Slightly more land was covered by trees than in the 20th century, and bears, beavers and wolves lived wild in England, bears being hunted to extinction by the 11th century and beavers by the 12th. Of the 10,000 miles of roads that had been built by the Romans, many remained in use and four were of particular strategic importance—the Icknield Way, the Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street—which criss-crossed the entire country. The road system was adequate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the period, although it was significantly cheaper to transport goods by water. The major river networks formed key transport routes, while many English towns formed navigable inland ports.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 Ofcom {{commissioned}} research among {{residents of}} the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to pirate radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for pirate radio. According to the research both pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the public at large. Pirate radio was regarded as {{the best place to}} hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the story by AMO, and the parasitic {{nature of the}} rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake}} of coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E

5|$|The Gothic style {{developed}} {{fully in}} the later nineteenth century. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who adapted the Gothic style <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), trained {{in the office of}} leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, where he worked on many small churches, including St James the Less in Leith, Christ Church, Falkirk (1862) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh (1876). He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane (1890–93) and Paisley Abbey (1898–1907). Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75), working mainly in Glasgow, began in the Gothic style, but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). Scotland's most influential architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, designed a number of churches, but only one, Queen's Cross Free Church, Glasgow (1898–99) was built. It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower, and has a simple, elegant, rectangular structure with a single aisle.|$|E
5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E
