40|$|Clinacox® 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} containing 0. 5 % diclazuril {{and is used}} to control coccidiosis in poultry. The previous conclusion on the safety of diclazuril in chickens for fattening at the use level of 1 mg/kg complete feed is extended to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> are in a similar physiological stage as chickens for fattening. The use level proposed for diclazuril in feed {{is the same for}} both categories of birds. Consequently, the metabolic fate and residue status of this additive described for chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Feeding diclazuril at 1 mg/kg complete feed to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> <b>for</b> the first 16 weeks of life would result in negligibly low or absent residues of diclazuril in the first eggs for production. Therefore, maximum residue levels (MRLs) for eggs are not necessary. The previous assessment of consumer safety for the use of diclazuril in chickens for fattening is confirmed and extended to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> The same MRLs for tissues as already established can be applied. Clinacox® has a low irritation potential for the eye and skin. Skin sensitisation was not observed. Considering the particle size (particle of respirable size) and dusting potential, exposure by inhalation cannot be excluded, although workers’ exposure has been calculated to be low in comparison with the ADI. In the absence of any data on respiratory toxicity, a hazard from inhalation of dust cannot be entirely excluded and appropriate protective measures should be taken. The use of Clinacox® at 1 mg/kg complete feed does not pose a risk to the terrestrial or aquatic environment. One mg diclazuril/kg complete feed is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying...</b>|$|R

This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening.

The applicant is now seeking to reduce the minimum authorised dose from 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed to 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed when used with chickens for fattening and all minor avian species (except laying birds) and to extend this authorisation to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> The safety <b>for</b> the consumers, users of the product and the environment has been previously assessed by EFSA {{and found that it}} did not raise concerns. In a previous opinion the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening when used at the then recommended dose. The Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> This conclusion can be taken to apply to the revised dose for all of species under application. The data from three trials made with chickens for fattening confirmed the effectiveness of the additive when used at the currently authorised dose of 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed. Effects with the reduced dose of 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed were less clear and showed significantly positive results in only two of the five trials in which this dose was tested. However, a meta-analysis made by pooling results from the five trials showed significant gains in final body weight and improved feed conversion indicating that the additive had some potential to improve performance of chickens for fattening at the lower dose.

The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens for fattening {{has been established in}} a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying,</b> safety <b>for</b> this animal category can be presumed.

The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment.

30|$|Duck {{is still}} very famous and is in {{vigorous}} demands {{in many areas of}} the world, especially in Asia. Ducks come second to chicken for the production of eggs in India. They are predominantly <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> purpose. Spent and culled ducks are marketed after 3 – 4 laying years. Such duck meat intended for human consumption has less juiciness, more toughness, less palatability which are the concealed reasons for unacceptability of the duck meat by the consumers, though there is no substantial decline in its nutritive value with escalation in age (De 2001). Comminuted, emulsion type, value added meat products can be prepared from this desi duck meat to enhance their acceptability. Moreover, processing of duck meat is more critical to provide variety of duck meat products to consumer so that demand and marketability can be augmented. Comminuted emulsion products permit inclusion of edible by-products such as skin, gizzard and heart from the spent birds, which would suffice to reduce the cost of the product and improve the yield and quality of finished product.|$|R

Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel {{is in a position to}} adopt the already proposed ADI for diclazuril (1. 7 mg diclazuril per person per day). The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety. Consequently, no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys for fattening...|$|R

For this purpose, 24 white Dekalb laying hens, half of which had been reared in an aviary system and the other half in a conventional cage system, were tested in a holeboard task. Birds from both treatment groups learnt the task, however the cage-reared hens required more time to locate rewards and had poorer levels of working memory.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess the {{flexibility}} of production allowed by extensive production conditions faced with variations in the environment, i. e., market variations and climatic fluctuations, of Limousin beef systems. The study used a case-based methodology in which seven beef farms with less than 1 LU/ha were chosen. Data collection was based on three interviews using a semistructured questionnaire and on the analysis of productive and economic results over a 15 -year period (1991 - 2005). The main evolution of these farms is related to a rise in work productivity associated {{with an increase in}} herd size. Herd increase was made possible by enlarging the area, the margin of intensification being limited in these regions. To take advantage of the enlarged land area, <b>females</b> were <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> fattening or for reproduction instead of selling them at weaning. The Limousin female provides a wide product mix because of its plasticity, as has been studied by several researchers. This mix flexibility is achieved by delaying product differentiation, a form of production flexibility that can reduce the risk of under-producing or over-producing varied product configurations. On the other hand, calves sold to the Italian market after weaning are generic products, associated with a flexible production process to overcome fluctuations in forage availability due to climatic variations. The introduction of maize silage for feeding acts as an alternative route, actual and potential, through the system to overcome unexpected forage shortage from natural grasslands as a result of droughts. The study shows that extensive farming systems have developed types of flexibility to match different factors of uncertainty from the environment. Finally, the issue of farm system performance is thus not so much a question of whether a farm is fit at a specific moment in time, but whether it transforms into a less or more sustainable orientation...|$|R
