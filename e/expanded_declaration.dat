40|$|In 1991, the {{international}} nuclear nonproliferation community was dismayed {{to discover that}} the implementation of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under its NPT INFCIRC/ 153 safeguards agreement with Iraq had failed to detect Iraq's nuclear weapon program. It was now clear that ensuring that states were fulfilling their obligations under the NPT would require not just detecting diversion but also the ability to detect undeclared materials and activities. To achieve this, the IAEA initiated what {{would turn out to be}} a five-year effort to reappraise the NPT safeguards system. The effort engaged the IAEA and its Member States and led to agreement in 1997 on a new safeguards agreement, the Model Protocol Additional to the Agreement(s) between States and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards. The Model Protocol makes explicit that one IAEA goal is to provide assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The Model Protocol requires an <b>expanded</b> <b>declaration</b> that identifies a State's nuclear potential, empowers the IAEA to raise questions about the correctness and completeness of the State's declaration, and, if needed, allows IAEA access to locations. The information required and the locations available for access are much broader than those provided for under INFCIRC/ 153. The negotiation was completed in quite a short time because it started with a relatively complete draft of an agreement prepared by the IAEA Secretariat. This paper describes how the Model Protocol was constructed and reviews key decisions that were made both during the five-year period and in the actual negotiation...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} two {{significant}} recent findings. One is a culmination of the Superkamiokande experiments, which demonstrate Neutrino oscillation and therefore a non-zero mass. The other is {{the finding that the}} universe will continue to <b>expand</b> without <b>declaration</b> based on distant supernovae observations. At the very least these two findings call for a review of the existing and generally accepted theories. In this talk it is pointed out how such a Neutrino Mass can in fact be deduced from a theoretical model, as also the eternal expansion feature of the universe, and how both these findings do not contradict each other. ...|$|R
5000|$|States that {{ratify the}} Convention appoint a single body to receive {{requests}} from other state parties regarding {{information on the}} [...] "law and procedure in civil and commercial fields {{as well as on}} their judicial organisation". When a request for such information is received from a judicial authority in another state party, the Convention makes it mandatory of the state to provide information in response to the request. States may by individual agreement or <b>declaration</b> <b>expand</b> the categories of information that must be provided.|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution <b>expanded</b> {{upon the}} <b>Declaration</b> of the Rights of Man {{and of the}} Citizen of 1789, to which it added several rights: it proclaimed the superiority of popular {{sovereignty}} over national sovereignty. It added several new economic and social rights, including right of association, right to work and public assistance, right to public education, right of rebellion (and duty to rebel when the government violates {{the right of the}} people), and the abolition of slavery, all written into {{what is known as the}} Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793.|$|R
5000|$|After a year {{of intense}} {{consultations}} the defence ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the Benelux Declaration on Defence Cooperation on 18 April 2012. This <b>declaration</b> <b>expands</b> the 1987 Benelux agreement on cooperation and coordination in defence matters. The Belgian Defence minister Pieter De Crem said at that ceremony that [...] "we are {{en route to a}} totally new structure with a trinational command. This is a first step to a full integration of assets and joint operability." [...] The Dutch Defence minister Hans Hillen declared that BeNeSam was an extraordinary base to build upon. He didn't reject the idea of mixed crews. Earlier during that week Hillen also said on Belgian radio that it is not impossible that the three armed forces could be integrated into [...] "Benelux Armed Forces" [...] one day.|$|R
