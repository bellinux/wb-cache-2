5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

[...] His two-and-a-half years as Premier {{were the last}} of the thirty-six-year Social Credit dynasty, as his defeat by Peter Lougheed saw its {{replacement}} by a new era Progressive Conservative government. [...] He is remembered as an honest, <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> who lacked the political skills of his predecessor, Ernest Manning, or of Lougheed.|$|E

500|$|Paine {{could not}} publish part III of The Age of Reason in America until 1807 {{because of the}} deep {{antipathy}} against him. Hailed {{only a few years}} earlier as a hero of the American Revolution, Paine was now lambasted in the press and called [...] "the scavenger of faction", a [...] "lilly-livered sinical [...] rogue", a [...] "loathsome reptile", a [...] "demi-human archbeast", [...] "an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> except the President of the United States [...] ".

500|$|He {{refused to}} update the command {{structure}} of the Air Force from one based on region to one of function, something his successor, Air Marshal Hardman, would accomplish, and has been criticised for a systemic resistance to change. Jones was described in David Horner's The Commanders as [...] "a steady, sincere but colourless leader", while Alan Stephens found him [...] "a good and <b>decent</b> <b>man,</b> who had overcome considerable personal hardship in his youth to achieve exceptional professional success" [...] but [...] "neither an inspiring leader, nor a notable thinker". Nevertheless, his Plan D for the RAAF's post-war organisation remained the service's blueprint until the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Henry's reign did {{not receive}} much {{attention}} from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin. At {{the end of the}} 20th century, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority. Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian David Carpenter judges Henry to have been a <b>decent</b> <b>man,</b> who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been [...] "essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful".|$|E

Bush said of him; [...] "General Norm Schwarzkopf, to me, epitomized the 'duty, service, country' creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great Nation through our most trying international crises. More than that, {{he was a}} good and <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> and a dear friend." [...] In a statement, President Barack Obama said [...] "From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, General Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved." [...] In a letter, Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno wrote in a joint statement, [...] "Our nation owes a great debt of gratitude to General Schwarzkopf and our Soldiers will hold a special place in their hearts for this great leader. While much will be written in coming days of his many accomplishments, his most lasting and important legacies are the tremendous soldiers he trained and led." ...|$|E

However Mainwaring opposed an amendment to exclude men from Wales and Monmouthshire from the liability to do National Service, declaring that [...] "no <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> or woman in Wales would support the amendment".|$|E

2500|$|Thieu {{was criticized}} by many opponents and historians, and {{appreciated}} by others. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Ellsworth Bunker, told former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird about Thieu: [...] "He {{is an individual}} of very considerable intellectual capacity. He made the decision in the beginning to follow the constitutional road, not to rule with a clique of generals, which many of them expected he would do. He has been acting {{more and more like}} a politician, getting out into the country, following up on pacification, talking to people, seeing what they want." [...] The military historian Lewis Sorley suggests that South Vietnam’s President Nguyen Van Thieu “was arguably a more honest and <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> than Lyndon Johnson, and – given the differences in their respective circumstances – quite likely a more effective president of his country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A fictionalized Abberline was {{featured}} as {{the protagonist of}} Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel From Hell (1991–1999), and was subsequently portrayed by Johnny Depp in the very liberal film adaptation of that work (2001). The graphic novel paints him as a sulky but sympathetic policeman, different from his peers only in his moralism and being overweight, and takes pains to include little-known details of his life such as his involvement with the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. The film's version of Abberline was portrayed as an intelligent young detective who is {{ahead of his time}} in his deductive techniques. He is also portrayed as being clairvoyant, allowing the filmmakers to ascribe to Abberline the contributions of spiritualist and psychic Robert James Lees, thus combining the two into one character and simplifying the graphic novel's narrative. [...] Although Abberline is addicted to opium and drinks absinthe, he is a <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> who ultimately goes on a crusade against very powerful governmental and upper-class figures to stop the grotesque murders of Jack the Ripper. In the film, Abberline dies of an overdose in his late 30s; in reality, he died of natural causes aged 86.|$|E
2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> and he succeeds because that is what he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E

2500|$|Historians {{have been}} mixed in their {{evaluations}} of Charles and his reign. [...] One {{of the most critical}} has been Helmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who has described Charles as [...] "a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician." [...] However, others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried, as Emperor-King, to halt World War I. An English writer, Herbert Vivian, wrote: [...] "Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come." [...] Furthermore, Anatole France, the French novelist, stated: [...] "Emperor Karl is the only <b>decent</b> <b>man</b> {{to come out of the}} war in a leadership position, no one listened to him. He sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. It was a wonderful chance that was lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of his death, the entire, nearly commercial-free half-hour of NBC Nightly News was {{dedicated}} to Russert's memory. [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton released a joint statement saying Russert [...] "had a love of public service and a dedication to journalism that rightfully earned him the respect and admiration of not only his colleagues but also {{those of us who}} had the privilege to go toe to toe with him." [...] Many of his colleagues in both newspaper and television reporting also offered tribute to Russert in this and other programs. Other major news agencies, including CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, and the BBC spent large segments of their programming on June 13 reporting about Russert's life and career. President George W. Bush stated in a news conference with French president Nicolas Sarkozy: [...] "America lost a really fine citizen yesterday when Tim Russert passed away. I’ve had the privilege of being interviewed by Tim Russert. I found him to be a hardworking, thorough, <b>decent</b> <b>man.</b> And Tim Russert loved his country, he loved his family, and he loved his job a lot." [...] Bruce Springsteen, a friend of Russert's, gave an on-stage tribute to him while performing in Cardiff, Wales, on June 14 and again at Russert's televised Kennedy Center memorial service, calling him [...] "an important irreplaceable voice in American journalism" [...] and offering condolences to his family. [...] On the June 13, 2008, episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien simply walked onto the stage {{at the start of the}} show. Instead of his usual upbeat antics and monologue, O'Brien announced that he had just received news about the sudden death of his good friend, fellow NBC employee and frequent Late Night guest Tim Russert. O'Brien proceeded to show two clips of his favorite Russert Late Night moments.|$|E
