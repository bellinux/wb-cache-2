5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree <b>in</b> <b>physics</b> and mathematics at Swarthmore College.

5|$|In October 2008, 11 then-current {{faculty and}} {{research}} staff at Princeton University were Nobel laureates. By 2013, the cumulative total of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton was 36. Princeton claims laureates who attended as students or who were employed when they received the Prize {{or did the}} research leading to it. Woodrow Wilson, {{the former president of}} Princeton, was the first Princeton-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Princeton laureates: James Cronin and Val Logsdon Fitch won the 1980 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Physics,</b> Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. won the 1993 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Physics,</b> David Gross and Frank Wilczek won the 2004 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Physics,</b> and Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims won the 2011 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Seventeen Princeton laureates have won the Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Physics,</b> more than any other category. Twenty-five laureates were members of the Princeton faculty, 12 laureates received their Ph.D. at Princeton, and four laureates, Woodrow Wilson, Eugene O'Neill, Gary Becker, and Michael Spence, were Princeton undergraduates.|$|E

40|$|Implementing {{flip-flop}} teaching <b>in</b> a <b>physics</b> classroom {{allows students}} to learn concepts outside {{of the classroom and}} apply what they learn in the classroom, working with other students and getting immediate feedback from the instructor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of flip-flop teaching in the performance of engineering students <b>in</b> introductory <b>physics</b> particularly <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics.</b> The study employed descriptive and quasi-experimental method to describe and compare the performance of engineering students <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics</b> when grouped according to sex and types of instruction. Three physics classes consisting of 125 sophomore engineering students at the Batangas State University during the second semester of the SY 2013 - 2014 were handled by the researcher and selected purposively as participants of the study. It was found out that the variation in the performances of male and female students in the conceptual questions, in the problem solving questions, and overall performance <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics</b> are not significantly different. Male and female students have an overall satisfactory performance <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics.</b> The study also revealed that the variation in the performances of the students in the conceptual questions, in the problem solving questions, and overall performance <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics</b> when grouped according to the types of instruction are not significantly different. Engineering students taught <b>in</b> a traditional <b>physics</b> classroom, <b>in</b> a flipped <b>physics</b> classroom, and <b>in</b> an enhanced-flipped <b>physics</b> classroom are more likely to have similar performances <b>in</b> thermal <b>physics...</b>|$|R
