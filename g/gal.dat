5|$|The slow rate of {{production}} for the Hamilcar {{appears to be the}} result of a combination of factors. There was a great demand on the specific types of wood required to build the glider, and difficulty in finding suitably large airfields with enough skilled personnel where the gliders could be constructed and stored; it also appears that a lack of official priority and poor management at <b>GAL</b> also impeded production. Between March and August 1942 <b>GAL</b> had promised eighteen Hamilcars would be built and delivered, but by September only one had actually appeared; this slow rate {{of production}} so concerned the Ministry of Aircraft Production that it appointed an 'Industrial Panel' of three senior industrial experts to visit <b>GAL</b> and detail the causes of the problems. The panel visited <b>GAL</b> in early September 1942 and issued a report on 24 September which stated that the root of the problems was that <b>GAL</b> appeared to have taken a bigger workload than it could handle, which was exacerbated by poor organisation and management skills. There were also conflicts between <b>GAL</b> and the Hamilcar Production Group which hurt production; the Group had been formed by the Ministry on 28 July in an attempt to speed up production, but senior <b>GAL</b> managers resented this and failed to co-operate fully with the Group. The panel also identified a 'piecemeal method of ordering' by the Ministry of Aircraft Production as a cause of further delays. Ultimately several senior managers and staff at <b>GAL</b> were replaced on the recommendation of the panel in an attempt to decrease internal conflicts and speed up production.|$|E
5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US <b>gal).</b> This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US <b>gal)</b> drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US <b>gal)</b> drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the <b>GAL</b> issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the <b>GAL</b> case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the <b>GAL.</b> Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the <b>GAL</b> scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Galling</b> is a known failure {{mechanism}} in sheet metal forming. It results in increased cost of die maintenance and scrap rate of products. For high strength steels, problems with <b>galling</b> are of major interest, since forming pressure is high {{as well as}} shear stress. In the last ten years, significant {{progress has been made}} on development and understanding of <b>galling</b> in sheet metal forming. In this paper, the main test apparatus and the methods used to reduce <b>galling</b> tendency are reported. And the <b>galling</b> mechanisms of <b>galling</b> are also analyzed. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} for {{predicting}} {{the position of}} the <b>galling</b> generation in square cup drawing is proposed {{based on the fact that}} <b>galling</b> at a drawn cup occurs at the position subjected to the maximum temperature and at the moment that the position is just sliding out from the die. Three kinds of blank shape, square, octagon, and tricontadigon are used to change the <b>galling</b> position on the drawn cup. FEM simulation shows that <b>galling</b> on the drawn cup occurs at the top of the boundary between the drawn area and the bent area for the square blank and at the top of the middle of the drawn zone for the octagon or tricontadigon blank. Demonstration experiments using a high-tensile-strength steel sheet under a lubricated condition show that the <b>galling</b> on the drawn cup does occur as predicted by FEM simulation. <b>Galling</b> on the die surface is left at the path end of the <b>galling</b> position of the blank material. It is also found that the sliding distance after the <b>galling</b> position of the blank reaches the maximum temperature gives a great effect on the <b>galling</b> generation: the longer the sliding distance is, the easier the <b>galling</b> generation becomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} edge effects on communities of <b>galling</b> insects in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, were performed data analyses comparing the <b>galling</b> richness between disturbed and undisturbed areas, and subsequently evaluated the richness of <b>galling</b> at different distances from the forest edge. We registered 194 <b>galling</b> insect morphotypes in 116 host plant species. <b>Galling</b> insect richness was more pronounced in disturbed areas {{and closer to the}} forest edge, both to community in general as to specific host plant taxa. These results indicate positive responses of <b>galling</b> insect richness to edge effects in forest environments. Edge effect could influence the <b>galling</b> distribution in modified habitats because increases the stress conditions of the plants and decreases the attack pressure of natural enemies...|$|R
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US <b>gal)</b> tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US <b>gal)</b> oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US <b>gal)</b> fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the <b>GAL,</b> became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the <b>GAL.</b> Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the <b>GAL</b> scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E
5|$|The BVE {{vanished}} after 1981 but, from 1983 onwards, the <b>GAL</b> began {{carrying out}} similar attacks and abductions. The first in Bayonne occurred on 17 October 1983, when alleged ETA members Joxe Lasa Arostegi and José Ignacio Zabala disappeared. Their mutilated {{bodies were found}} in Alicante in 1985. An unsuccessful kidnapping attempt occurred the following day and, in December, Ramón Oñaederra, an alleged ETA member and Mikel Goikoetxea, an alleged ETA leader, were assassinated by the <b>GAL</b> in separate incidents. Prior to the Monbar attack, two people had been killed and six injured in three separate attacks in the town in 1985.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{high tensile}} steel sheet attracts {{attention}} in recent years. <b>Galling</b> occurs easily in the press forming processes of the {{high tensile steel}} sheet {{because of the high}} contact pressure. However, the <b>galling</b> behavior can’t be predicted in the forming process yet. The object {{of this study is to}} clarify the <b>galling</b> mechanism and develop a prediction method of <b>galling</b> behavior in press forming. Experiments were carried out to investigate the <b>galling</b> behavior in the square cup drawing of a high tensile strength steel sheet. On the die surface, <b>galling</b> occurs at the bottom of the boundary between the straight and corner. On the drawn cup <b>galling</b> starts at the top of the same boundary. The variations of contact pressure, sliding distance and temperature were investigated by using FEM. It was found that <b>galling</b> occurs on the sheet surface position having the history of maximum temperature and at the moment just before sliding out from the die. 1...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{mechanical}} properties of most wear materials are generally insufficient for structural applications, hardfacing alloys have been traditionally weld deposited {{to provide a}} wear resistance surface for a base material. An important attribute of a hardfacing alloy that is subjected to high load sliding contact is the resistance to adhesive (<b>galling)</b> damage. Although Co-base hardfacing alloys generally possess excellent <b>galling</b> wear resistance, there is interest in developing cobalt-free replacement hardfacings to reduce radiation exposure costs. A laboratory <b>galling</b> test has been developed for weld hardfacing deposits that is a modification of the standardized ASTM G 98 - 91 <b>galling</b> test procedure. The procedure for testing a weld hardfacing deposit on a softer base metal using a button-on-block configuration is described. The contact stresses for the initiation of adhesive <b>galling</b> damage were measured to rank the <b>galling</b> resistance of several commercial Fe-base, Ni-base and Co-base hardfacing alloys. Although the <b>galling</b> resistance of the Fe-base alloys was generally superior to the Ni-base alloys, neither system approached the excellent <b>galling</b> resistance of the Co-base alloys. Microstructure examinations were used to understand the micro-mechanisms for the initiation and propagation of <b>galling</b> damage. A physical model for the initiation and propagation of adhesive wear is used to explain the lower <b>galling</b> resistance for the Ni-base hardfacings and to understand the influence of composition on the <b>galling</b> resistance of Ni-base alloys. The composition of some Ni base hardfacings was modified {{in a controlled manner}} to quantify the influence of specific elements on the <b>galling</b> resistance...|$|R

5|$|The General Aircraft Limited <b>GAL.</b> 49 Hamilcar or Hamilcar Mark I {{was a large}} British {{military}} glider {{produced during}} the Second World War, {{which was designed to}} carry heavy cargo, such as the Tetrarch or M22 Locust light tank. When the British airborne establishment was formed in 1940 by the order of Prime Minister Winston Churchill it was decided to develop a large glider which would be able to transport heavy equipment in support of airborne troops. General Aircraft Limited were chosen in January 1941 to develop this glider, which they designated the <b>GAL.</b> 49 'Hamilcar'. It was designed to transport a single light tank or two Universal Carriers. A number of problems, which included vacillation by the War Office on the number of gliders that it wanted and poor management by <b>GAL,</b> led to delays in the production of the Hamilcar, and the first production glider was only assembled in mid-1943. These problems were only partially solved, and production of the glider continued to be slow, hampered by difficulties in finding suitable locations to store and construct the Hamilcars once their parts were produced. A total of 344 Hamilcars had been built when production ended in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Time <b>Gal</b> is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time <b>Gal,</b> uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E

Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Galling</b> is a known failure {{mechanism}} in many {{sheet metal forming}} processes, which limits the lifetime of tools, thus {{the quality of the}} products is affected. In this study, U-channel stamping experiments are performed to investigate the <b>galling</b> behavior of the advanced high strength steels in sheet metal forming. The sheet materials used in the tests are DP 590 and DP 780. In addition to the DP steels, the mild steel B 170 P 1 is tested as a reference material in this study. Experimental results indicate that <b>galling</b> problem becomes severe in the forming process and the <b>galling</b> tendency can be divided into three different stages. The results also show that sheet material and tool hardness have crucial effects on <b>galling</b> performance in the forming of advanced high strength steels.

40|$|The {{idea that}} <b>galling</b> insects {{actively}} manipulate host plant chemistry {{has been previously}} documented but has not been quantified {{across a range of}} <b>galler</b> and host plant taxa. We present the first quantitative review of the relationship between insect <b>galling</b> and levels of secondary metabolites in host plants. Using meta-analytic techniques, we examined this relationship across 40 <b>galler</b> and host plant species combinations. We found that <b>galling</b> insects are associated with significantly higher levels of tannins and phenolics; however, no difference was found for volatiles. Hymenoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera were associated with higher levels of secondary metabolites; however, only Hymenoptera was significant. The climatic zone of the study area did not explain significant differences in gall-induced secondary metabolites. Overall the results show that the ability of <b>galling</b> insects to manipulate host plant secondary chemistry is widespread across insect and plant taxa. The evolutionary success of <b>galling</b> insects may be in part due to this unique ability. Casey R. Hall, Anthony R. Carroll, Roger L. Kitchin...|$|R

The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US <b>gal)</b> left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US <b>gal)</b> per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft).
