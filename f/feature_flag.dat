2500|$|OpenZFS on OSX (abbreviated to O3X) is an {{implementation}} of ZFS for macOS. [...] O3X is under active development, with close relation to ZFS on Linux and illumos' ZFS implementation, while maintaining <b>feature</b> <b>flag</b> compatibility with ZFS on Linux. [...] O3X implements zpool version 5000, and includes the Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) originally authored for MacZFS, {{which has been}} further enhanced to include a memory management layer based on the illumos kmem and vmem allocators. [...] O3X is fully featured, supporting LZ4 compression, deduplication, ARC, L2ARC, and SLOG.|$|E

50|$|A feature toggle (also feature switch, <b>feature</b> <b>flag,</b> feature flipper, {{conditional}} feature, etc.) is {{a technique}} in software development that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple source-code branches (known as feature branches), such that the feature can be tested, even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the features, during run time. For example, during the development process, the developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for remaining users.|$|E

50|$|Deploying to {{production}} {{is the most}} sensitive step; it may be done by deploying new code directly (overwriting old code, so only one copy is present at a time), or by deploying a configuration change. This can take various forms: deploying a parallel installation of {{a new version of}} code, and switching between them with a configuration change; deploying a new version of code with the old behavior and a <b>feature</b> <b>flag,</b> and switching to the new behavior with a configuration change that performs a flag flip; or by deploying separate servers (one running the old code, one the new) and redirecting traffic from old to new with a configuration change at the traffic routing level. These in turn may be done all at once or gradually, in phases.|$|E

50|$|In a more {{distributed}} development model, {{having a}} single version number {{is far from}} ideal as all implementations of OpenZFS would need to agree on all changes to the on-disk file system format. The solution selected by OpenZFS was to introduce <b>feature</b> <b>flags</b> as a new versioning system that tags on-disk format changes with unique names, and supports both completely independent format changes and format changes that depend on each other. A pool can be moved and used between OpenZFS implementations as long as all <b>feature</b> <b>flags</b> in use by the pool are supported by both implementations.|$|R

50|$|Another {{benefit of}} <b>feature</b> <b>flags</b> is canary launches. A canary release (or canary launch or canary deployment) allow {{developers}} to incrementally test features {{by a small}} set of users. If a feature's performance is not satisfactory, then it can be rolled back, without any adverse effects.|$|R
