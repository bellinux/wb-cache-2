50|$|A <b>knitted</b> photo <b>blanket</b> {{is made by}} {{a machine}} that uses a similar {{scanning}} and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see knit). Often <b>knitted</b> photo <b>blankets</b> consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.|$|R

Knitting in Company is an {{activity}} held after school, during which students <b>knit</b> <b>blankets</b> that are then donated to Wrap with Love, a charity that provides blankets {{to people who}} are susceptible to hypothermia. Environment Group involves weekly meetings during which students tend to the school's vegetable gardens and discuss environmental issues. The Environment Group is also responsible for promoting the annual Green Day.|$|R

50|$|Since {{they live}} in the cold climate of the Andes, the Paez build their homes using brick, metal, cement, and wood. The Paez women raise and shear sheep for wool. They clean the wool, spin yarn from it, dye it and <b>knit</b> clothes and <b>blankets</b> for their families.|$|R
5000|$|Practices {{of craft}} or [...] "domestic arts" [...] have {{traditionally}} existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, {{the labor and}} production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was marginalized and undervalued. As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, <b>knitting</b> <b>blankets,</b> weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy {{has been successful in}} claiming these domestic values for women and using {{it as a way to}} keep women in subservient roles. The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices. Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was [...] "a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience." [...] Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in Consciousness raising that was key to Second-wave feminism as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.|$|R

I knit what I feel. Knitting is my way of interpreting, communicating and coming to terms with, {{the world that we}} inhabit. It sits between me and my internal world and the physical world around me like some form of <b>knitted</b> comfort <b>blanket.</b> <b>Knitting</b> has long held associations with practical function, the production of garments to keep us warm and comfortable. Like many people I have a desire to own functional, knitted works, but I have no desire to make them. When I was pregnant I was continually being asked what I had been knitting my baby. I had knitted nothing. Guilt got the better of me and she received a jumper, then depression and she received some giant pram trousers. In 1999 I exhibited my series of Odd Sweaters, at the Crafts Council Gallery in London. These sweaters are not garments to be worn but to “visually discuss” ideas about normality and conformity. One visitor to the gallery remarked that it was “such a waste”. Our need to justify objects through function is great, but our actual needs aren’t. Who really needs another jumper, cushion yet alone tea-cosy? Most of us in western society have far more than we need. Function is a fiction in our desire to knit. However the emotional function of knitting is another matter all together. In this paper I will reflect upon my own knitted works and my use of knitting to explore and communicate my thoughts about perfection, death, motherhood, gender inequality and {{what it is to be}} human.

5000|$|Given the {{dominance}} of subsistence farming in Iceland, {{there was a lack}} of specialisation and commerce among farms. As testified in some of the Icelandic sagas, domestic trade seems to have been suspect as a type of usury from the age of settlement. Trade with foreign merchant ships was lively, however, and vital for the economy, especially for cereals and honey, alcohol, and (later) tobacco. Fishing ships from the coastal areas of Europe stopped for provisions in Icelandic harbors and traded what they had with the locals. This would include stale beer, salted pork, biscuits, and chewing tobacco, sold for <b>knitted</b> wool mittens, <b>blankets,</b> etc. Merchant ships put in occasionally from Holland, Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Spain, to sell their products, mainly for stockfish. It is prominently displayed in the royal seal of Iceland.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the concept and development of a knowledge-based advisory system for the optimum utilisation of South African wool for the beneﬁt of present and potential investors and other interested parties. Wool is a natural animal ﬁbre produced in varying quantities around the world. The wool ﬁbre is far from homogenous; its type and quality, such as ﬁneness and length, depending on the breed of sheep and the environmental conditions prevailing during its growth. Wool is used {{in a variety of}} end uses, ranging from ﬁ ne worsted suiting, to hand <b>knitting</b> yarn, carpets, <b>blankets</b> and aircraft upholstery, its use depending largely on its ﬁbre ﬁneness and length. The wool industry {{is one of the oldest}} agricultural industries in South Africa, playing an important economic role as an earner of foreign exchange, and providing a living to many people. Wool is produced in many parts of South Africa under extensive, semi-extensive or intensive conditions, and is largely an export commodity. It is produced and traded in a sophisticated free market business environment into the international market place, where supply and demand forces determine price levels. More than 90 % of locally produced wool is exported in an unprocessed or semi-processed form which detrimentally affects employment, foreign exchange and income-generating opportunities associated with value-addition prior to export. To reduce the amount of wool exported in unprocessed or semi-processed form, wool-processing enterprises need to be established to produce internationally marketable end products. Therefore, South Africa needs to attract investors into the wool sector, who will set up manufacturing mills in an economically sustainable manner. Potential and present investors in the South African (S. A.) wool industry need easily accessible and up-to-date information on the production statistics, processing properties and end-use pplications of the wool they need for the particular end-products they manufacture or could manufacture. To achieve this and ensure accessibility to such continuously updated information, it is essential to develop an integrated computer-based system. It is with the above in mind that a knowledge-based system for the optimum utilisation of South African wool has been developed, which is described here. This paper reviews relevant work in this ﬁ eld and covers wool production statistics in South Africa, the end uses of the wool ﬁbre versus the diameter of the ﬁbre, the advantages of distributed architectures, and the ﬂow of processes in a wool utilization system. It then sets out the concept and development of the proposed system, including the architecture of the proposed expert system, the associated analysis and ﬁnally the conclusions. The components of the expert system, namely the knowledge base, inference engine, knowledge acquisition component, and explanation system are described. The architecture of the system incorporates the concept of distributed systems and the related advantages incorporated in its general architecture and within its internal components. It marries both expert and general knowledge-based systems, consisting of a combination of an ordinary knowledge-based system (KBS) that can be queried for information and an expert system that provides advice to users. The distributed system developed involves collection of autonomous components that are interconnected, which enables these components to coordinate their activities and share resources of the system, so that users perceive the system as a single integrated facility. There are a number of advantages of such a distributed system and these are articulated in the paper. This approach allows not only incremental development of the system, but also facilitates sharing of data and information. The distributed nature of the architecture of the system developed, consists of three main elements: The expert system to advise on the characteristics of the wool that is required for a particular end use A knowledge-based system for querying on the distribution of wool of the various characteristics in South Africa An expert system for the selection of the best alternative area for investment for the particular product end use. The knowledge base consists of a number of databases, each representing the various wool characteristics. This represents a distributed architecture of the knowledge base. Therefore, this architecture inherits all the advantages of distributed processing systems as described in the paper. These knowledge bases can be queried by the user via a database management system (DBMS), a software that manages the creation, updating, maintenance and querying of the database. In terms of wool utilization, the system involves capturing the end-use and requirements of a product and from it, retrieving the characteristics of the wool that will meet the particular end-use. The availability of the wool is then checked by region and province for each style, type, clip type, yield, colour, vegetable matter fault and micron range, in line with the latest statistics available. The system developed enables questions such as the following to be asked at the user interface: What is the anticipated end use of the wool? What criteria must the wool satisfy for the selected end-use? What quantities of wool are required? The outputs at the user interface of the system are the quantities of wool per province and region in terms of micron, style, yield, colour, type, clip type as available on the web-site of Cape Wools SA. At the very end of the system, the best alternative site for siting the manufacturing base can also be indicated. </p...|$|R
