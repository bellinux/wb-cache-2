40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a new approach to estimate the effective leakage area using the inverse modeling process {{as an alternative to the}} blower <b>door</b> <b>test.</b> An actual office building, which is the head quarter of Energy Efficiency Hub, was used as an example case in this study. The main principle of the inverse modeling process is comparing the real monitor boiler gas consumption with the result calculated from the EnergyPlus model with a dynamic infiltration rate input to find the best estimation of the parameter of effective leakage area (ELA). This thesis considers only the feasibility of replacing the blower <b>door</b> <b>test</b> with the calibration approach, so rather than attempting an automated calibration process based on inverse modeling we deal with generating a first estimate and consider the role of model uncertainties that would make the proposed method less feasible. There are five steps of the whole process. First, we need to customize our own actual weather data (AMY) needed by the energy model (EnergyPlus model), which can help increase our quality of the result. Second, create the building energy model in EnergyPlus. Third, create a multi-zone model using CONTAM with different ELA estimation of each facade to calculate the dynamic infiltration rate of each ELA estimate. Fourth, input the dynamic infiltration rate got from the CONTAM model to EnergyPlus model and output the boiler energy consumption. Fifth, compare the boiler gas consumption from the model and the real monitor data and find the best match between the two and the corresponding ELA, which gives the best estimate from the whole inverse modeling process. From the simulation result comparison, the best estimation of the total building ELA from the inverse modeling process is the 23437 cm 2 at 4 pa, while the result from the blower <b>door</b> <b>test</b> is 10483 cm 2 at 4 pa. Because of the insufficient information of the building and also the uncertainty of the input parameters, the study has not led to a definite statement whether the proposed calibration of the ELA with consumption data can replace a blower <b>door</b> <b>test</b> to get an equally valid or even better ELA estimate, but it looks feasible. As this this case study is done in a deterministic context, the full feasibility test should be conducted under uncertainty. A first step towards this will talk be discussed in chapter 4.

40|$|The {{most common}} method of {{measuring}} air leakage is to perform single (or solo) blower door pressurization and/or depressurization test. In detached housing, the single blower <b>door</b> <b>test</b> measures leakage {{to the outside}}. In attached housing, however, this "solo" test method measures both air leakage to the outside and air leakage between adjacent units through common surfaces. Although minimizing leakage to neighboring units is highly recommended to avoid indoor air quality issues between units, reduce pressure differentials between units, and control stack effect, the energy benefits of air sealing can be significantly overpredicted if the solo air leakage number {{is used in the}} energy analysis. Guarded blower <b>door</b> <b>testing</b> is more appropriate for isolating and measuring leakage to the outside in attached housing. This method uses multiple blower doors to depressurize adjacent spaces to the same level as the unit being tested. Maintaining a neutral pressure across common walls, ceilings, and floors acts as a "guard" against air leakage between units. The resulting measured air leakage in the test unit is only air leakage to the outside. Although preferred for assessing energy impacts, the challenges of performing guarded testing can be daunting...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to carry out a search based on {{available}} literature that focused on historical development of timbered houses in the Czech Republic that are intended for permanent living. A survey was conducted subsequently to this search. This survey concentrated on firms that nowadays build timbered houses and also on construction solutions and structure composition of such houses. The conducted survey describes prevalent construction solutions of timbered houses in the current housebuilding sector of the Czech market. The thesis focuses on thermal properties of today's timbered wooden structures. Next, an indicative measurement of these buildings {{was carried out by}} a blower <b>door</b> <b>test</b> and thermal imaging diagnostics. Furthermore, the thesis compares timbered structures with standard requirements for permanent housing. Interestingly, the measurements for instance showed that one new building met the requirements of the blower <b>door</b> <b>test.</b> Next, several thermography measurements demonstrated seamless heat transfer of a timbered wall as a whole. The conclusion of the thesis summarizes the current use and construction of timbered houses in the Czech Republic. Moreover, it sums up the results of the measurements and outlines the survey results regarding the thermal properties of these houses...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} well freezers, chest freezers, frozen and chilled door cabinets (solid or glass door) and open fronted chilled cabinets under EN 441 test conditions demonstrated that maximum temperatures in cabinets were generally in the most exposed (to ambient) areas and that minimum temperatures were located in the least exposed areas. Detailed positions of maximum and minimum temperature varied between cabinet types. In chest freezers 95 % of the maximum temperature positions were located in the top layer and 95 % of the minimum temperature positions were located in the middle layer of the cabinets. In <b>full</b> <b>door</b> frozen cabinets the maximum temperature position was in the majority of cases on the top shelf (64 %) with most maximum packs being {{at the front of the}} top shelf (53 %). In the chilled <b>full</b> <b>door</b> cabinets 94 % of the maximum temperature packs were situated at the front of the cabinet. In open fronted cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (97 %) were located at the front of the cabinet, the largest number (60 %) being at the front of the base of the cabinet. In well cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (81 %) were located in the top layer of the cabinet and the majority (91 %) of minimum temperature packs were located in the bottom of the cabinet. Large differences in energy consumed by cabinets of similar size and temperature performance were found indicating that large reductions in energy and CO 2 emissions could be achieved by selection of the most efficient cabinets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R
