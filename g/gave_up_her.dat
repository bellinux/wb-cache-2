5|$|Tubman {{served as}} a nurse in Port Royal, {{preparing}} remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery. She rendered assistance to men with smallpox; {{that she did not}} contract the disease herself started more rumors that she was blessed by God. At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{managed the}} first tour of Trial by Jury, which {{stopped at the}} Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by his vision for {{establishing}} a company to promote English comic opera and <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved {{in all of his}} business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years {{after the death of his}} first wife.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Indiana Jones {{universe}} and revolves around the eponymous protagonist's global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E
5|$|Bessie's {{increasingly}} centrist stance troubled {{party members}} in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down {{before the next}} general election. This {{was rejected by the}} NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the May 1955 general election the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 to deselect her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations had no effect on Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the municipal elections held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted alderman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Imogen became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began {{helping with the}} {{organisation}} of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint {{artistic director of the}} festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Imogen's own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.|$|E

5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the adopted {{daughter}} of Mr. Sanbourne and Ruby Lincoln and the adoptive sister of Eve Russell, who is Ruby's daughter {{from a previous}} marriage. Eve and Liz are both unaware of the adoption, believing that they were half-sisters. Mr. Sanbourne repeatedly molested Liz after Eve left home to be a nightclub singer, and a prostitute, and start a relationship with businessman Julian Crane. Liz blamed Eve for abandoning her to her father's sexual abuse. When she was fourteen, Liz went to Boston in search of Eve. She tracked down Julian at a jazz club {{to talk to him}} about her sister and their relationship. Later that night, Alistair Crane, Julian's father, raped Liz in his son's apartment; Julian was passed out in a drunken stupor in the same room and was unaware of what happened. The rape resulted in Liz's pregnancy with Chad Harris-Crane, who was later believed to be Eve and Julian's son; Liz <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> baby for adoption at birth, and was forced to undergo surgery that left her barren.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, {{a friend}} from the Jacaranda, heard about Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks, covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a desk, chair and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E
5|$|To {{make her}} {{performances}} {{as a female}} boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuña and her coach Ramón Chaparro. They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring {{and how to make}} various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training. Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, which was {{the first of its kind}} in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside. Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio.|$|E

5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the {{strippers}} JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
