5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure how many as {{a variety of other}} words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E

The music for the game was collected as a soundtrack, Uru Music, that was released in 2003.|$|E
5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect {{people all over the}} world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Claude Mézières {{himself has}} worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for {{director}} Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des temps (The Ice People). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a God for director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in Mézières Extras.|$|E
5|$|The city of Las Vegas had lobbied <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the {{headquarters}} for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was {{to be built in}} the desert near the dam site. This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} now {{dominated the}} government and parliament, there remained significant pockets of Scottish support for James, a movement which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James. This was especially strong among the clergy and gentry who lost out with the abolition of Episcopacy in the Church of Scotland and in certain Highland clans. It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> definitive on the extent or make up since clan loyalties or feuds were often as important as religion or attachment to the Stuarts; this included generalised hostility between Lowlanders and Highlanders, specific feuds (Campbells and McDonald's) or differences within branches of the same clan; Gordons and Fletchers fought on both sides in 1715 and 1745. In addition, the Stuart monarchy only ended {{with the death of}} Queen Anne in 1714, so until then, supporting the Stuarts was not necessarily the same as being a Jacobite.|$|E
5|$|In October 1985, Mézières was {{contacted}} by the German director Peter Fleischmann who proposed to adapt Russians Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's 1964 novel <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a God into a film. This {{was to be the}} first major German-Soviet co-production. Mézières travelled to Moscow to join the production team and also to Uzbekistan where it was proposed to shoot the film. Travelling from there to Munich, he produced several concept drawings and paintings over a three-month period before the project was suspended due to funding difficulties. At this point Mézières left the production and returned to France. Filming was eventually scheduled to begin in April 1986 in Kiev and Mézières re-joined the production, creating storyboards for some scenes. However, at this time the Chernobyl disaster occurred only 100km from Kiev and production was again halted. The film was eventually finished in 1989, but Mézières' concepts were barely used. Again, many of Mézières' designs were later published in Les Extras de Mézières.|$|E
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E

25|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{was started}} by Ivan Yefremov's utopian novel Andromeda Nebula (1957). He was soon followed by brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, who explored darker themes and social satire in their Noon Universe novels, such as <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a God (1964) and Prisoners of Power (1969), {{as well as in}} their science fantasy trilogy Monday Begins on Saturday (1964). A good share of Soviet science fiction was aimed at children. Probably the best known was Kir Bulychov, who created Alisa Selezneva (1965-2003), a children's space adventure series about a teenage girl from the future.|$|E
