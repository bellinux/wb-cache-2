5|$|Beaty {{was born}} into slavery on October 8, 1837, in Richmond, Virginia. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1849, where he {{received}} an education. He gained his freedom sometime on or before April 19, 1861; the exact date is unknown {{and may have been}} before his move to Ohio. While in school, he developed an interest in theater and made his public acting debut at a school concert. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a black cabinet maker and eventually worked as a turner. He continued to study acting privately and received training in the field from several coaches, including <b>James</b> <b>E.</b> Murdock, a retired professional stage actor from Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, <b>James</b> <b>E.</b> Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930–31 season, {{the team}} was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate <b>James</b> <b>E.</b> Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
