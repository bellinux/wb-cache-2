500|$|The {{steel frame}} of the {{building}} was made in Germany {{and is based on}} a model made in the early 1880s in Chicago to increase fire resistance. It was erected by Messrs Potts & Co. of Oxford Street. <b>Fireproofing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were conducted by <b>the</b> Columbian <b>Fireproofing</b> Company Ltd. of Pittsburgh and London, with steel-ribbed bars allowing for ventilation, while remaining sound proof and free from vibration. <b>The</b> internal <b>walls</b> consist of [...] "hollow, porous, terra-cotta blocks" [...] covered with plaster, and the hotel's flooring was also made <b>fireproof.</b> At <b>the</b> corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Hoover's {{contribution}} was to order that <b>the</b> home be <b>fireproof,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed of hollow tiles. Built from 1919 to 1920, {{the house was}} the couple's first and only permanent residence. The Hoovers lived there {{only a short time}} before Herbert was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Warren G. Harding in 1921, a role he continued under President Calvin Coolidge. It was here that Hoover awaited the Presidential election returns in 1928, when he won against Alfred E. Smith, and 1932, when he lost the election to Franklin D. Roosevelt. During Hoover's presidency (1929-32), the Hoover family only made brief visits to their Stanford home. They returned to this house after 1932, while maintaining a New York apartment as a second residence.|$|R
50|$|The Helepolis bore a fearsome {{complement}} of heavy armaments, with two 180-pound (82 kg) catapults, and one 60-pounder (27 kg) (classified {{by the weight}} of the projectiles they threw) on the first floor, three 60-pounders (27 kg) on the second, and two 30-pounders (14 kg) on each of the next five floors. Apertures, shielded by mechanically adjustable shutters, lined with skins stuffed with wool and seaweed to render them <b>fireproof,</b> perforated <b>the</b> forward <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> tower for firing the missile weapons. On each of the top two floors, soldiers could use two light dart throwers to easily clear <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of defenders.|$|R
40|$|This study uses a {{metal stud}} {{partition}} fireproof drywall measuring 83 [*]mm in thickness as a test specimen to explore the impact of an embedded junction box on the firefighting performance of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> through one time of standard fire test on a 300 [*]cm × 300 [*]cm area and five times of standard fire test on a 120 [*]cm × 120 [*]cm area. The {{results show that the}} quality of calcium silicate board plays a big role in <b>the</b> <b>fireproof</b> effectiveness. <b>The</b> embedded junction box located on the backside of the fire can reduce the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> especially <b>the</b> area above the socket. The thickness of rock wool may increase the performance, but in a limited rate. External junction box may not impact <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing</b> performance of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> but it still possesses some safety risks. An embedded junction box measuring 101 × 55 [*]mm could already damage the fire compartment, and in reality there may be more complicated situations that should be noted and improved...|$|R
5000|$|Trenton Central High School (TCHS) {{opened on}} January 4, 1932, and was {{dedicated}} on January 18 at ceremonies attended by 5,000 people. Hailed as [...] "an ornament to the city" [...] and [...] "one {{of the show}} places of Trenton," [...] TCHS {{was one of the}} largest and most expensive high schools built in the country. The Chambers Street façade stretches broadly for almost 1000 ft, nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall. The cost of the building, including land and furniture, totaled $3.3 million. Most firms involved in the construction were based in Trenton, including John A. Roebling's Sons who provided [...] "Jersey" [...] wire lath to <b>fireproof</b> <b>the</b> ceilings and <b>walls.</b>|$|R
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for removing asbestos- containing <b>fireproofing</b> require <b>the</b> construction of air-tight barriers, labor- intensive scraping of <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing,</b> and <b>the</b> installation of new asbestos-free <b>fireproofing.</b> <b>The</b> DMATM product {{is the result}} of a joint development by W. R. Grace 2 ̆ 6 Co. and Department of Energy 2 ̆ 7 s Brookhaven National Laboratory. The new technology uses a foamy solution sprayed directly onto asbestos-containing fireproofing. After absorbing into <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing,</b> <b>the</b> foam chemically digests asbestos fibers and dissolves them into harmless minerals. The process is the first to chemically destroy asbestos without first removing <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing...</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{structure}} that collapsed, {{only three of}} the four supporting columns was covered with a <b>fireproofing</b> material. <b>The</b> columns that supported the pressure relief valves and emergency vent piping had no <b>fireproofing</b> at all. <b>The</b> columns that were not <b>fireproofed</b> bent in <b>the</b> ensuing fire while <b>the</b> <b>fireproof</b> columns were found upright during the after-accident investigation. The American Petroleum Institute issued a recommendation in July 1988 that steel supporting pressure relief and emergency flare lines should be <b>fireproofed.</b> <b>The</b> recommendation had been issued prior to construction of the Olefins II Unit.|$|R
500|$|When Little Ferry, New Jersey {{contractor}} William Fehrs {{was hired}} to construct a film storage facility in 1934, he designed the structure to be <b>fireproof.</b> <b>The</b> building had [...] outer walls and a reinforced concrete roof. Internally, it was divided into forty-two individual vaults, each enclosed behind a steel door and separated with [...] brick interior <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> local fire department confirmed Fehrs's <b>fireproofing.</b> Despite <b>the</b> potential for fire, the facility was located in a residential neighborhood, and was equipped with neither a fire sprinkler system nor mechanical ventilation.|$|R
5000|$|Called the [...] "Tatsumi" [...] turret, the {{southeast}} turret {{looks like it}} has two stories, but it actually has three. The white coating on <b>the</b> mud <b>walls</b> made <b>the</b> structure both waterproof and <b>fireproof.</b> <b>The</b> southeast turret {{is similar to the}} southwest turret. The construction adheres to the original Tokugawa design. The symbol of a hollyhock, the crest of the Tokugawa family, can be seen on the ridge-end tiles. The turret has been designated an Important Cultural Asset.|$|R
50|$|The Williamsburg County Courthouse {{is located}} in the {{business}} district of Kingstree on Main Street. The original grounds of where the courthouse stands were the original parade grounds in the town of Kingstree and were used by the militia during the revolution. The courthouse was built in 1823 by Robert Mills, a nationally known architect that hailed from South Carolina. The second level of the courthouse suffered a fire in 1883 but because <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were 30 inches thick and <b>fireproof,</b> <b>the</b> building was restored. Other changes and additions were added to the courthouse including in parking for horses in 1901, and a third floor in 1954.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{protective}} <b>fireproofing</b> {{continues on}} <b>the</b> {{top of the}} kura by forming an inner roof covered {{in the same way}} as <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> timbers for the outer roof then sit on a <b>fireproof</b> box. <b>The</b> outer roof was used to protect the clay finish from rain. In rural areas this outer roof was often constructed of thatch which would burn off in the event of a fire. However, due to their relatively short lifespan and complexity in replacing, thatch roofs are becoming a rarity. [...] In towns the roofs were usually tiled. To prevent fire from destroying the roof timbers supporting the outer roof, the eaves were sometimes thickened up with the plaster coating and extended to the underside of the tiles.|$|R

5000|$|According to the New York Times, the Department of Buildings has {{for decades}} allowed [...] "...licensed {{professionals}} to self-certify that {{components of the}} construction process itself—installation of the girders, the bolts, <b>the</b> concrete, <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing,</b> <b>the</b> wiring and more—are performed according to code.|$|R
50|$|Designed by architects Frederic J. Klein and H. C. Alford, the {{exterior}} octagonal dome {{was done in}} an Italian Renaissance style while the auditorium was designed in a Spanish colonial style with tile-roofed balconies running along <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Twinkling star lights were put in the ceiling and a lighting effect projected clouds passing overhead. The theater had a capacity of 980, with 225 of those seats being in the balcony. Using local contractors, Vogel Brothers Construction saw to the installation of modern innovations in acoustics and <b>fireproofing.</b> <b>The</b> first theater in Wisconsin designed specifically for sound motion pictures, the Eastwood featured a $15,000 Western Electric Vitaphone system. The cost of the entire project neared $250,000. The first manager was A. P. Desormeaux, formerly of the downtown Strand Theater.|$|R
5000|$|Despite many common Glaswegian {{features}} [...] such as typical corner turrets, careful modelling of <b>the</b> external <b>walls</b> {{and a pair}} of steep gables on the roof, {{the building}} was built using the Hennebique system by French Engineer, François Hennebique. This system involves mainly reinforced concrete offering an alternative to steel frames, making <b>the</b> building <b>fireproof.</b> <b>The</b> Hennebique system was designed to strengthen concrete to make it withstand forces which damage concrete the most and consists of using situ concrete (situ meaning 'cast in its place'). This allows <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to be extremely thin with a thickness of 100mm in order to maximise the amount of space within the rooms and avoid the need to have exterior scaffolding. The Hennebique system was first used in 1894 in Wiggen, Switzerland [...] and the Lion Chambers was the second building in Scotland [...] to adopt this system {{and one of the first}} buildings in the UK.|$|R

50|$|The {{fire started}} around 7:30 p.m. on 2 August 1973, and {{was caused by}} three boys who were smoking in a small, disused kiosk {{adjacent}} to the centre's miniature golf course. Eventually the burning kiosk collapsed against {{the exterior of the}} building. This part of the building was clad in a material called Galbestos—profiled steel sheeting with asbestos felt on both sides coated with bitumen, with limited fire-resistance qualities. The fire spread to <b>the</b> <b>wall's</b> interior soundproofing material, which also had poor fire-resistance qualities, causing an explosion that ignited the highly flammable acrylic sheeting which covered the rest of the building. The fire spread quickly across the sheeting on <b>the</b> leisure centre <b>walls</b> and roof, and through vents which were not properly <b>fireproofed.</b> <b>The</b> acrylic melted, which allowed more oxygen to enter and dropped burning melted material, both starting other fires and injuring those trying to escape. The building's open-plan design included many unblocked internal spaces that acted as chimneys, adding to the conflagration.|$|R
50|$|Around 18:37, {{the trains}} collided, while {{traveling}} approximately 100 km/h each. The shock destroyed both locomotives and some cars in both trains, and ignited several gasoline-fueled fires. Due {{to the fact}} that the materials used in the carriages were not <b>fireproof,</b> <b>the</b> fire spread quickly, producing great amounts of smoke.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{experimentation}} and numerical simulating {{have been done}} to validate <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing</b> performance of big water curtain. The breadth and highness of water curtain is 15 m and 12. 5 m. The dimension of fire space: 18 m× 15 m× 12. 5 m (length×breadth×highness). The dimension of no fire space: 42 m× 15 m× 12. 5 m (length×breadth×highness). The result shows that: water curtain can prevent fire propagating and drops in temperature clearly; <b>the</b> water curtain <b>fireproofing</b> is feasible and effective; flux and thickness of the water curtain and the diameter of drip have major influence upon effect of <b>the</b> water curtain <b>fireproofing.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion of this paper should be helpful for <b>the</b> <b>fireproofing</b> water curtain design...|$|R
