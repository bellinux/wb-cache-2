40|$|<b>Friction</b> buffer <b>stops</b> are the favoured {{construction}} of buffer stop, mainly {{due to its}} high resistance and variety of layout. Last but not least is its manner of deceleration induced upon impact and during the braking what makes it smart solution in railway transport safety. The general approach of designing buffer stops is via usage of the kinetic energy and its conversion into work. Paper describes input parameters such as train velocity or buffer stop vicinity which is expressed by the safety coefficient implanted within the calculation. Furthermore, the paper shows the principle of calculation the <b>friction</b> buffer <b>stop</b> work, or to be more precise, the work of its braking jaws and optionally the work of additional braking jaws located behind the buffer stop. Last section of the paper {{is focused on the}} examples of designing <b>friction</b> buffer <b>stops,</b> points out the main complications and shows the charts of relation amongst braking distance, kinetic energy and braking force and the charts of relation between deceleration rate and braking distance...|$|R
50|$|When {{the brake}} pads and wheels got wet, {{there was little}} <b>friction</b> to <b>stop</b> the trains and they slid too far onto the brakes. For safety reasons, only one train ran per side in rainy weather.|$|R
50|$|<b>Friction</b> buffer <b>stops</b> are clamped 'loosely' to the rails, {{and when}} {{hit by a}} train that fails to stop correctly, move with the train for perhaps 30 m {{scraping}} {{the top of the}} rails, which absorbs considerable energy.|$|R

50|$|Electronic systems {{make use}} of {{electric}} currents or electromagnetic fields to trigger some action in the locomotive cab. While mechanical systems were generally limited to venting the brake pipe and triggering an emergency stop, electronic systems can trigger other actions such as an acknowledgment from the driver, cutting power or a less severe application of the brakes. Without physical contact electronic systems could be used with higher speeds, limited only be the equipment's ability to sense the signal from <b>stop</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ELV (Extra-baixa tens√£o or EBT in Portuguese) {{is officially}} defined into the Regulatory Standard no. 10 from the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment as any voltage [...] "not {{exceeding}} 50 volts a.c. or 120 volts d.c.". Although that standard defines safety rules for electricity, the Regulatory Standard no. 12 requires an even lower voltage for start and <b>stop</b> <b>devices</b> on machines and equipment made from March 2012 and on, stating it shall not exceed 25 volts a.c. or 60 volts d.c.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOperational {{reliability}} of a pipeline valve {{depends on the}} durability of the weld sealing surfaces of the <b>stop</b> <b>device,</b> while the durability of the sealing surface {{is determined by the}} coating material properties. To enhance stop valve durability, a new composition for a flux-cored wire was developed, ensuring the generation of the surfacing metal with alloying system Cr-Ni-Mo-Mn-Si-Nb-Ti-B. Such wire provides overall hardening of the coating matrix with carboboride and intermetallic phases, providing an advanced operational {{reliability of}} stop valve nodes operating under friction conditions in aggressive environment...|$|R
50|$|Signals set to {{stop for}} the diesel light rail cars are {{positively}} enforced via Intermittent Inductive Automatic Train Stop. The system is similar (but not identical) to the German Indusi system, where signal aspects are transmitted to moving trains from wayside devices. The inductive train <b>stop</b> <b>devices</b> are placed by the running rails {{in advance of the}} absolute signals. Train's emergency brakes are automatically engaged if a stop signal overrun occurs and interlockings are designed with sufficient overlap for trains to come to a complete stop before conflicting with other traffic.|$|R
5000|$|Cab {{signalling}} in the United States {{was driven}} by a 1922 ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that required 49 railways to install some form of automatic train control in one full passenger division by 1925. [...] While several large railways, including the Santa Fe and New York Central, fulfilled the requirement by installing intermittent inductive train <b>stop</b> <b>devices,</b> the PRR saw an opportunity to improve operational efficiency and installed the first continuous cab signal systems, eventually settling on pulse code cab signalling technology supplied by Union Switch and Signal.|$|R

Sprinters reach with some weight relief {{temporarily}} speeds of up to 45 km/h must therefore run on a large deck of up to 300 cm in length and have up to 100 cm width. At high physical exertion and increased risk of falling a fall stop unit is required to prevent a fall of the subjects or patients. This fall <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> is usually implemented by a safety arch on which a rope is attached to an electrical switch. A harness bears the subject preventing from falling and shuts down the running belt.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{basis for}} a cost-effective and reliable grinding process of mixed oxide ceramics requires a fundamental understanding of the prevailing grinding mechanisms to maintain surface quality and strength requirements. However, these material removal mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This paper presents an innovative quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> for the interruption of cut during grinding. This appropriate method allows {{a detailed analysis of}} the interactions of grains along the contact zone. The results reveal correlations between the prevailing grinding mechanisms, the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation of the zirconia based ceramics as well as the resulting bending strength. ¬© 2016 The Authors.

40|$|A quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> (QSD) was {{designed}} for use in orthogonal machining and rubbing experiments. QSD's are used to obtain chip root samples that {{are representative of the}} deformation taking place during dynamic (actual) cutting conditions. These 'frozen' specimens are helpful in examining the plastic deformation that occurs in the regions of compression and shear which form the chip; the secondary shear at the tool-chip interface; and the nose ploughing/flank rubbing action which operates on the newly machined surface. The Hammer QSD employs a shear pin mechanism, broken by a flying hammer, which is traveling at the same velocity as the workpiece. The device has been successfully tested up to 6000 sfpm (30. 48 m/sec) ...|$|R
40|$|The use of quick-stop device allows {{observing a}} {{sequence}} of frozen images focused on the chip formation area when machining in orthogonal turning tests. This work records {{the development of a}} quick-stop device employing a servo motor. The present invention relates generally to a quick <b>stop</b> <b>device,</b> for combination with a cutting machine that is able to abruptly interrupt the cutting process between a cutting tool and the surface being cut. A dead metal zone is clearly seen when using rounded-edge cutting tools. In this study, variation of the dead metal zone is examined with the computer aided quick-stop device (CAQSD). It is clear from the experimental photomicrographs that as the cutting edge radius increases, dead metal zone increases...|$|R
30|$|The {{temperature}} distribution of untreated samples and pretreated CuCl 2 samples with different welded times {{are shown in}} Fig.¬† 2. The first three figures a, b, and c show the untreated group with welded times 3, 5, and 7 ¬†s, and the latter three d, e, and f are the pretreatment group with welded times 3, 5, and 7 ¬†s. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.¬† 2 that in both the untreated groups and pretreated groups, the welding interface maintained a relatively high temperature in the rotation welding progress. The results indicated that the temperature decreased with the increase in the depth and the extension of time. Figure¬† 2 a, d shows that the temperature began to decline rapidly at 4 ¬†s for each depth. It indicated that the rotating friction provided a large amount of heat to the interface, and once the rotational <b>friction</b> <b>stopped,</b> the temperature decreased immediately. The same phenomenon also occurred in Fig.¬† 2 b, e at 6 ¬†s and Fig.¬† 2 b, f at 8 ¬†s.|$|R

40|$|AbstractContinuously cooled {{bainitic}} steels {{have the}} potential to replace conventional quenched and tempered steels in automotive applications. Whereas the machining performance often decides about the cost effectiveness of a particular part, little general knowledge exists about the machinability of such novel steels. First practical experiences with drilling operations confirm the good machinability of bainitic steels as well as the potential for further optimization. Also from a scientific point of view a better understanding of chip formation in the drilling process is desirable. This includes the variation of forces over the drilling edge and the determination of corresponding shear angles. For generating real chip roots a quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> was developed. In addition to conventional metallographic micro sections, a non-destructive method namely computer tomography was used for characterization of chip formation based on chip roots...|$|R
