500|$|The {{union of}} song and symphonic form in Mahler's music is, in Cooke's view, organic; [...] "his songs flower {{naturally}} into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast." [...] To Sibelius, Mahler expressed {{the belief that}} [...] "The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything." [...] True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life's struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. Amid all this is Mahler's particular hallmark—the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges {{as one of the}} majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony [...] "the most farcical {{and at the same time}} the most tragic piece that ever existed... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rarely, {{perhaps for}} the first time, has the vernacular {{language}} taken on such a godlike gentleness and sweetness and harmoniousness as {{in the language of}} Mr Pallis. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> one is listening to the tinkling of the bells of a distant flock, such as those that first greeted the Birth of Christ." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet it did {{provoke the}} {{beginning}} of the great period of exception in Picasso’s life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts… ...|$|E

Well, I entered those trees feeling a fairly honest man, and I came out of them feeling like a murderer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{something}} terrible {{had happened to me}} there; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had killed someone there. Ugh!" [...] and he shivered and took another pull at the Hollands.|$|R

2500|$|Eiseley's writing often {{includes}} {{his belief}} that mankind {{does not have enough}} evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In The Immense Journey, he writes, “…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we stood {{at the heart of a}} maze and no longer remembered how we had come there.” According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is [...] "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] and that [...] "the human version of evolutionary events [...] perhaps too simplistic for belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Barbara Brend: Superficially the {{illustrations}} to Jami's stories {{are very similar}} to those of works for Tahmasp; they are complex compositions of a high level of finish, but there are more figures which are slightly grotesque, more youths with a slightly louche, pussycat smile, and a palette which admits more brown and purple tertiary colours. [...] The eye is pulled restlessly over the page from detail to detail. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the painters had lost confidence {{in the power of the}} ostensible narrative subject to interest the viewer, and were searching for other means to hold the attention. [...] Innocence had been lost; the classic works would continue to be illustrated, but only as a vehicle for the painters' skill; they seem no longer to have a mythic hold on the imagination. [...] The future of painting was to lie in more realistic subjects, though their treatment often disguises that realism from us.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless." [...] It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.|$|E

2500|$|Sothern's {{next great}} role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's The Crushed Tragedian (1878, {{originally}} named The Prompter's Box) at the Haymarket. [...] The Era admired [...] "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" [...] of his portrayal. [...] He next appeared in The Hornet's Nest by Byron at the Haymarket. [...] The Crushed Tragedian {{was not a}} great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer raved, [...] "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ {{and you know that}} he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous." [...] In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play Money as Sir Frederick Blount.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the words, [...] "And {{they shall}} make an Ark," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Shalom taught that God {{said that all}} should come and occupy {{themselves}} with the Ark so that they all might merit the Torah. Rabbi Simeon taught {{that there are three}} crowns – the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but the crown of a good name surpasses them all. The table is the crown of kingship, of which [...] says, [...] "And make thereto a crown of gold round about." [...] The altar is the crown of priesthood, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make unto it a crown of gold round about." [...] And the Ark is the crown of the Torah, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make upon it a crown of gold round about." [...] The word for [...] "crown" [...] (zer, [...] ) can also be read as zar (stranger), to teach that if a person has merit, it becomes like a crown, but if a person does not have merit, then it becomes alien to that person. Of the other furnishings, Scripture says, [...] "And you shall make," [...] whereas of the Ark, [...] says, [...] "And they shall make," [...] to teach that the crown of the Torah stands above all; when a person acquires the Torah, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> that person has acquired all the rest.|$|E
