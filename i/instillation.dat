40|$|Objective: For {{more than}} 20 years, BCG {{intravesical}} therapy schedule has included 6 weekly <b>instillations.</b> Very few studies have, however, analyzed the rationale of this regimen. We previously demonstrated that intravesical BCG induced an increased peripheral immune response against mycobacterial antigens {{as compared to}} pretreatment values. In the present work, we have studied the weekly evolution of this immune response induced by intravesical BCG <b>instillations.</b> Materials and Methods: The evolution of the lymphoproliferative response of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} against BCG culture filtrate (CF), tuberculin (PPD) and BCG extract (EXT) was tested before, every week during the BCG <b>instillations</b> and at 3 and 6 months follow-up in 9 patients with superficial bladder cancer treated with 6 weekly BCG <b>instillations.</b> Lymphoproliferation was measured by means of a tritiated thymidine incorporation test. Results: A significant increase in the lymphoproliferative response against PPD, CF and EXT was observed in 9, 8 and 7 of the 9 patients, respectively, as compared to pre-BCG values. The maximal lymphoproliferation was achieved after 4 <b>instillations</b> in 4 / 5 patients initially reactive against mycobacterial antigens whereas 2 of 4 initially nonreactive patients required 6 <b>instillations.</b> At 6 months' follow-up, lymphoproliferation against BCG and the other mycobacterial antigens returned to pre-BCG values in all patients. In 3 patients who received additional <b>instillations</b> because of tumor recurrence within 1 year of follow-up, the maximum immune response was observed already after 2 <b>instillations.</b> Conclusion: In most patients, the maximal peripheral immune response is already observed after 4 weekly <b>instillations.</b> However, patients not previously immunized against mycobacterial antigens may require 6 weekly <b>instillations</b> to achieve a maximum stimulation level. Our data support the need to further evaluate the role of this status before starting BCG <b>instillations.</b> It could be of interest to study whether 6 BCG <b>instillations</b> are really necessary in patients previously immune against mycobacterial antigens.

40|$|Objectives: The {{smooth muscle}} is an {{important}} component of the lower urinary tract, as normal voiding depends on its ability to respond appropriately to stimulation. Impairment of the contractile capacity of the vesical smooth muscle may be reflected in the global voiding function. Repeated intravesical <b>instillations</b> with mitomycin C or farmorubicin have a prolonged effect on bladder volume and compliance. The present study was undertaken to determine whether previous intravesical <b>instillations</b> with mitomycin C and farmorubicin influence the contractile responses of the smooth muscle of the bladder in rats. Material and methods: Forty Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Rats in three of the groups had intravesical <b>instillations</b> of either mitomycin C, farmorubicin, or saline. Rats belonging to the 4 th group had no intravesical <b>instillations,</b> and served as normal controls. The doses of drugs administered were based on those used for therapeutic purposes. After an induction course of three weeks, each bladder was cut in four strips (ventral, Elbadawi line, cranial and dorsal). Thereafter 136 bladder strips underwent electrical field stimulation. Results: Contractile responses did not differ significantly depending on bladder location. The most intense contractile responses, however, were noticed in the dorsal bladder strips, and the weakest responses in the cranial pole strips. Previous intravesical <b>instillations</b> with chemotherapeutic agents did not influence the contractile response of the smooth muscle of the bladder. Conclusion: Repeated intravesical <b>instillations</b> with mitomycin C or farmorubicin have no prolonged effect on the contractile strength of the isolated smooth muscle of the bladder...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Based on the {{requirement}} of a Th 1 immune response for clinical efficacy, and incited by the arbitrary induction scheme, frequent side effects and the empirical approach in improving BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, an alternative intravesical BCG treatment schedule for dose reduction was investigated without compromising Thl cytokine induction in the bladder in a mouse model. Methods: Mice were submitted to 6 weekly BCG <b>instillations</b> and treatment schedules omitting intermediate <b>instillations</b> during this standard scheme. Th 1 (IFN-gamma, IL- 2, IL- 12 p 40), and Th 2 (IL- 10, IL- 4) cytokine responses in individual mouse bladders were measured by a semi quantitative RT-PCR based method. Results: A schedule of only two BCG <b>instillations,</b> administered in week I and week 6, resulted in induction of at least the same levels of IFN-gamma, IL- 2 and IL- 12 p 40 Th 1 cytokine mRNA compared to 6 weekly <b>instillations,</b> whereas significantly lower levels of Th 2 cytokines IL- 10 and IL- 4 mRNA were observed. Conclusions: During the 6 -week period the intermediate weekly BCG <b>instillations</b> 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not contribute to Th 1 cytokine upregulation in the bladder, provided that the BCG dose is sufficient. Whether such a reduced BCG frequency schedule has immunestimulating capacity and therapeutic efficacy associated with less side effects in patients remains to be investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

The {{findings of the}} IARC {{are based on the}} discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal <b>instillation.</b> The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer.

40|$|Purpose: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) {{therapy for}} {{superficial}} bladder cancer is immune dependent and activation of a Th 1 immune response is probably required for clinical efficacy. Given the empirical approach to improving BCG therapy we investigated in a mouse model {{the consequences of}} modifications in BCG therapy with regard to Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine responses in the bladder. These studies may provide a rationale for possible modifications of the established clinical treatment protocol. Materials and Methods: The dynamics of Th 1 (interferon-gamma, interleukin [IL]- 2, IL- 12 p 40 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and Th. 2 (IL- 10 and IL- 4) cytokine responses during and after 6 once weekly intravesical BCG <b>instillations</b> in mice was determined by a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based method. Results: During 6 weekly BCG <b>instillations</b> a dose and time dependent induction of the various Th 1 as well as Th 2 cytokines was observed. The response pattern was comparable to urinary cytokine induction patterns in patients. Electrocauterization prior to BCG <b>instillations</b> led to lower and more variable levels of cytokine polymerase chain reaction products compared with noncauterization. Lowering the dose of BCG seemed to affect the Th 1 cytokine response most, whereas the Th 2 response was less influenced by dilution of the BCG preparation. Six <b>instillations</b> with nonviable BCG induced Th 2 but failed to induce Th 1 cytokines, which may explain the necessity of BCG viability for antitumor activity. However, when mice were first treated 3 times with viable BCG and subsequently received 3 <b>instillations</b> with killed BCG, the Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine pattern was comparable to the standard 6 -week regimen with viable BCG. Conclusions: The model seems an appropriate one in which to investigate changes in Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine gene expression levels in bladders resulting from modifications in intravesical BCG treatment. It was possible to induce a local Th 1 cytokine response with nonviable BCG provided that local sensitization to BCG antigens had occurred during preceding <b>instillations</b> with a viable BCG preparation.

Urinary cytospin slides were made for six patients {{for each of the}} six clinical <b>instillations</b> which constitute a therapeutic course. These slides were also stained for ICAM 1 and for leucocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA 1). RESULTS [...] Bladder cancer cells did not essentially express either ICAM 1 or 2, but cells in the stromal areas surrounding tumour expressed both these antigens.

However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing voltages between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor transmission efficiency.

The rapid spread of AC and haphazard <b>instillation</b> of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current. Starting in 1888 the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a parallel goal to limit, to the point of ineffectiveness, the voltages in AC power systems, a market then dominated by Westinghouse Electric.

Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E
