40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the role of muscle fiber types in modulating skeletal muscle growth and development. In the first study, we used MyHC IIX- and IIB-null mice to examine clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle growth. Four-week-old mice were administered with clenbuterol (20 parts per million in drinking water) for 2 weeks. In soleus muscles, which normally contain no IIX or IIB fibers, the hypertrophic effect of clenbuterol was not observed in any genotypes. Further study demonstrated that clenbuterol induced new fiber type formation only in soleus of wild type mice (IIX and IIB fibers) and IIB null (IIX fibers) mice, not in IIX null mice, suggesting that transitional expression of type IIB MyHC depends on the presence of IIX MyHC. Meanwhile, Clenbuterol induced hypertrophy was blunted in fast muscles (gastrocnemius, TA and EDL) of IIX or IIB null mice, demonstrating that the presence of IIX and IIB muscle fibers is essential for clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Finally, the loss of total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> contributed to the reduced muscle growth in IIB null mice and clenbuterol failed to rescue this fiber loss. In the second study, we demonstrated that extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in both wild type and IIB null have the same number of muscle fibers at birth, suggesting that loss of IIB MyHC gene does not alter prenatal muscle fiber formation. Although the gastrocnemius muscles in both wild type and IIB null mice have the same amount of muscle fibers at age of 2 weeks postnatal, the gastrocnemius muscle loses almost 50 % of total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> by 4 weeks of age postnatal and maintains the existing muscle fiber until adult period of life. In the third study, we hypothesized that skeletal muscle specific overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammar coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α) might rescue loss of total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and subsequent muscle mass by driving formation of slower muscle fibers and/or maintaining integrate neuromuscular junction in gastrocnemius muscle of IIB null mice. The proportion of IIA fibers was increased by 18 % at the expense of proportion of IIX fibers when PGC- 1 α was overexpressed in gastrocnemius of IIB null mice. Moreover, PGC- 1 α significantly increased total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> by 43 % in gastrocnemius of IIB null mice. Taken together, IIB muscle fiber is necessary to maintain total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and the subsequent muscle growth, and skeletal muscle specific overexpression of PGC- 1 α partially rescue the loss of total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> in gastrocnemius of IIB null mice. These data reveal new insights into understanding the mechanisms controlling postnatal maintenance of total <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> in skeletal muscles. ...|$|E

Therefore, we {{examined the relationship between}} the condition of the less affected corticospinal tract and motor function in hemiplegic pediatric patients. Forty patients with hemiplegia due to perinatal or prenatal injury (13. 7 ± 3. 0 months) and 40 age-matched typically developing controls were recruited. These patients were divided into two age-matched groups, the high functioning group (20 patients) and the low functioning group (20 patients) using functional level of hemiplegia scale. Diffusion tensor tractography images showed that compared with the control group, the patient group of the less affected corticospinal tract showed significantly increased <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value. Significantly increased <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value in the low functioning group were observed than in the high functioning group.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} effects of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC: Paylean®, ELANCO Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) on swine growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality and if its response is influenced by varying muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and birth weight. The swine industry is under increasing pressure to maximize efficiency, profitability, and lean meat production. Advances in nutrition, genetics, and general livestock management have enabled producers to increase their efficiency. Increased efficiency is attained through shortening days to harvest (ADG), enhancing feed conversion (G:F), and increasing carcass leanness. One method to increase ADG, G:F, and carcass leanness is through the utilization of RAC. Ractopamine hydrochloride is an orally active β 1 adrenergic agonist that is approved for use in the United States, and is incorporated into the pig’s finishing diet for the last 20. 4 to 40. 8 kg of BW gain. Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of RAC in improving ADG, feed efficiency, carcass weight, dressing percentage, and its negligible effects on meat quality. In this group of studies it was also demonstrated that RAC (10 ppm) was able to increase ADG, G:F, and dressing percentage in pigs that were finished at heavier than normal weight of 147 kg. Ractopamine was also demonstrated to increase HCW, carcass cut yield, and lean cut yield linearly over durations of 7, 14, 21, 28, or 35 d (pooled response of 5. 0 and 7. 4 ppm). With both aforementioned studies, there were negligible effects on meat quality. Another way to increase productivity in swine production is through decreasing weight variation. Two factors that impact harvest weight variation is birth weight and muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>number.</b> It is commonly recognized that low birth weight correlates with decreased survivability and lower postnatal growth rates. Within this population of pigs that were investigated, muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> was not different between birth weight classes of light (0. 9 kg), medium (1. 2 kg), and heavy (1. 5 kg). Muscle fiber diameter however, was increased 14. 9 µm in the 5 ppm RAC light birth weight classification compared to the 0 ppm RAC light birth weight classification. When looking at the effects of muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> (tertile means of 1. 3, 1. 7, and 2. 1 million fibers) on growth performance and meat quality, no trends or patterns were evident...|$|E

The results indicate cross-species conservatism in callosal fiber composition with a good interspecies relation between <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and brain size. Across species, increases in both brain size and callosal area indicate more callosal fibers, although less than expected from the estimated increase in cortical cell number. Within each species, the correlation between <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and brain weight tends to disappear, although in most cases a larger callosum implies {{a larger number of}} callosal fibers. The median fiber diameter was conservative across species (0. 11 - 0. 2 microm), indicating the maintenance of conduction velocity of most callosal fibers regardless of interhemispheric distance. Nevertheless, the maximal fiber diameters tended to be higher in species with larger brains. Therefore, there is a population of coarse-diameter fibers that tend to increase their diameter and conduction velocity with increasing brain size. However, allometric calculations suggest that the associated increase in velocity in these large fibers may not be sufficient to maintain a constant interhemispheric transmission time in different species...|$|E

METHODS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters were quantified by corneal confocal microscopy in 42 diabetic patients and 27 age-matched controls. The parameters quantified were the <b>number</b> of <b>fibers,</b> the tortuosity of <b>fibers,</b> the <b>number</b> of beadings, and the branching pattern of the fibers. Peripheral neuropathy was also quantified using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. RESULTS: The <b>number</b> of <b>fibers,</b> <b>number</b> of beadings, and branching pattern of fibers significantly decreases in diabetic patients versus control subjects (P<. 0001; P<. 0001; P=. 0006, respectively), whereas nerve tortuosity significantly increases (P<. 0001). The same corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters show a statistical trend, suggesting progression of corneal neuropathy with peripheral diabetic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal confocal microscopy represents a new tool in the diagnosis, clinical evaluation, and follow-up of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. This study found that diabetes damages corneal nerves, particularly the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus. This damage may be easily and accurately documented using corneal confocal microscopy.

Vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, and vastus medialis muscles (three of the quadriceps muscles) were analyzed at 5 months of age and at 3 -month intervals between 12 and 39 months of age.

40|$|Skeletal {{muscles are}} readily {{characterized}} by their location {{within the body}} and by the number and composition of their constituent muscle fibers. Here, we characterize a mutation that causes a severe {{reduction in the number}} of fibers comprising the tergal depressor of the trochanter muscle (TDT, or jump muscle), which functions in the escape response of the Drosophila adult. The wild-type TDT comprises over 20 large muscle fibers and four small fibers. In crossveinless (cv) mutants, the number of large fibers is reduced by 50 %, and the number of small fibers is also occasionally reduced.

We hypothesized that nerves implanted into the appropriate target tissue regain their function, whereas they degenerate when implanted into a different tissue. Therefore, aortic nerves of rabbits were transected and implanted into arteries or veins, and their function and structure was reevaluated after 1. 5, 3, and 10 months. In a subset of animals, the nerves were again severed and implanted into the other vessel. Twelve of 18 nerves implanted into arteries regained typical neurophysiological activity, but none of those implanted into veins. Two times even baroreflexes were elicited through the newly built nerve endings. The structure of the nerve endings implanted into arteries resembled baroreceptors, whereas no fiber growth was detected in veins. Morphometrically, the <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> and diameter increased over the observed time period after implantation into arteries.

The first study showed that fiber diameter increased linearly with fish size, whereas <b>fiber</b> <b>number</b> increases non linearly with fish size in the Blue Catfish correlated with dietary shift. The second study showed shorter spines in domesticated Channel Catfish as compared to wild Channel Catfish was a result of reduction in selection pressure during domestication in the absence of fish predators...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} and morphology of Salpa fusiformis along 30 °W from 55 to 25 °N are studied, {{resulting in}} the conclusion that two distinct populations can be recognized in this area. The northern, temperate population {{is characterized by a}} high <b>number</b> of <b>fibers</b> in the body muscles (averaging 52 for M I-VI in the aggregate form and 28 for M IV in the solitary form). The population occurred in high numbers during the spring of 1980; no diurnal vertical migration was observed. The southern, subtropical-tropical population is characterized by a low <b>number</b> of muscle <b>fibers</b> (averaging 39 in the aggregate form and 18 in the solitary form). Its abundance during the spring of 1980 was low and diurnal vertical migration conspicuous. At 38 °N a few specimens were caught with intermediate muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>numbers.</b> This area coincided with a distinct minimum abundance of Salpa fusiformis...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} an {{analytic}} quasiperiodically forced circle flow with a not super-Liouvillean base frequency {{and which is}} close enough to some constant rotation is C^∞ rotations reducible, provided its <b>fibered</b> rotation <b>number</b> is Diophantine {{with respect to the}} base frequency. As a corollary, we obtain that among such systems, the linearizable ones and those displaying mode-locking are locally dense for the C^∞-topology...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{evaluated}} frozen databases {{from two}} 52 -week randomized placebo-controlled clinical diabetic neuropathy trials testing two doses of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) : 500 and 1, 000 mg/day t. i. d. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Intention-to-treat patients amounted to 1, 257 or 93 % of enrolled patients. Efficacy end points were sural nerve morphometry, nerve conduction velocities, vibration perception thresholds, clinical symptom scores, and a visual analogue scale for most bothersome symptom, most notably pain. The two studies were evalu-ated separately and combined. RESULTS — Data showed {{significant improvements in}} sural nerve <b>fiber</b> <b>numbers</b> and regen-erating nerve fiber clusters. Nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes did not improve, whereas vibration perception improved in both studies. Pain as the most bothersome symptom showed significant improvement in one study and in the combined cohort taking 1, 000 mg ALC. CONCLUSIONS — These studies demonstrate that ALC treatment is efficacious in alleviat-ing symptoms, particularly pain, and improves nerve fiber regeneration and vibration perception in patients with established diabetic neuropathy...|$|R
