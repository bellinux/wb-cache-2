40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> market, its current situation in terms of volume, growth, prices, interest rates and new products, and an analysis of mortgage integration {{are the focus of}} this paper. The recent creation of the <b>European</b> <b>Mortgage</b> Finance Agency (EMFA), as an attempt to build a single European securitization market, is an important step toward integration within the wider goal of EU financial integration. Obstacles to integration, potential members of the EMFA, and its main goals and advantages are discussed in the forward-looking section of this paper. In addition, the paper deals with three important aspects of the EU mortgage market, taken as a whole: • How it operates. Other aspects considered include transaction costs, transparency requirements affecting credit institutions (European Code of Conduct), and a classification of mortgage products on the market. • Refinancing in Europe (as compared to the USA). The secondary market for the funding of financial institutions, in relation to mortgage bonds and mortgage-backed securities, including explanations of their main characteristics and the differences between them. • How <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets influence the economy and how they may affect private investment and consumption, household debt (which continues to increase each year), and the performance of financial institutions (high competitiveness) are other important points considered. <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> market integration; Growth; Interest rate applied; Transaction costs;...|$|R
40|$|Do {{globalization}} and Europeanization {{lead to the}} deterritorialization of <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets? Neither economic globalization nor EU policies have resulted in one <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> market. The various <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets are still quite {{different from one another}} in many respects. In most countries national lenders continue to dominate the market even though regulation itself has been internationalized to some extent. Deterritorialization has been slow for various reasons: tax, law, cultural and structural differences play a part, but the limited market share of mortgage intermediaries and the unequal treatment of foreign mortgage lenders in some countries also form a barrier. Path-dependent trajectories are highly important, but can sometimes be bypassed by global processes or downplayed by the entry of foreign firms. The secondary mortgage market is increasingly becoming globalized, while most primary mortgage markets remain largely national. The financial crisis may temporarily slow down securitization, while simultaneously both decreasing and increasing the globalization of mortgage regulation, firms and markets.

30|$|The German Civil Code (BGB) defines {{two types}} of {{collateral}} in real estate. The ‘mortgage’ (Hypothek) is used for accessory charges on property and the ‘land charge’ (Grundschuld) is used for non-accessory charges on property. In contrast to the ‘mortgage’, a ‘land charge’ continues to exist even if the debt is extinguished. ‘Land charges’ are common in German banking practice and ‘mortgages’ are only rarely used. See <b>European</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Federation</b> (2007) for further information on the ‘mortgage’ and the ‘land charge’ in Germany.|$|E
30|$|In that context, {{mortgage}} creditors {{would like}} to enforce their claims outside bankruptcy via mortgage foreclosures, but they are quite slow and expensive. According to <b>European</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Federation</b> (2007), their total costs are between the 10 and 12  % {{of the price of}} allocation and their usual length is between 15 and 25 months. As a result, the response of creditors is to rely more on some types of collateral—such as personal guarantees and accounts receivable—that can be realised directly by secured creditors and are not diluted by preferential creditors. These collateral types are used more often than mortgage collateral (Davydenko and Franks 2008).|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} model – {{in the form}} of composite index – is put forward to highlight the comparative inflation potential of national, residential real estate markets of the European Union. The composite index is formed from a suite of economic, demographic, sociological, and environmental variables. They are drawn from the literature as the best indicators of long-term, aggregate housing price growth for the given context. The variables proposed are: future economic growth; future population growth; future population youthfulness; super-normal infrastructure investment; future mortgage growth; latent demand; future climate; supply inelasticity; and cyclical undervaluation. These variables are represented in the composite index by datasets from, respectively: The Atlas of Economic Complexity; United Nations World Population Prospects; Eurostat Europop; European Commission Structural Investment Funding allocation; <b>European</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Federation</b> Hypostat (outstanding loans to disposable income); Eurostat SILC (adults living with parents), and World Bank annual remittance data; Meldelsohn et al. (2000); Nordregio Mountain Areas in Europe, and Eurostat Land Cover (water and wetlands); and the OECD Analytical House Price Database (index price to income ratio).

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{to what extent}} there are still transition factors influencing the property markets in the former Communist countries. When transition began over 20 years ago, there were clear differences from market economies as {{a direct consequence of}} their history in terms of institutions, property rights, approaches to markets, business organisation, laws, and physical forms of built environment. The {{article examines}} the extent of convergence with market economies and whether transition economies can still be regarded as a distinct group in terms of their property markets. Design/methodology/approach - The article takes a wide range of data, including that from the World Bank, World Economic Forum, Bertelsmann, Jones Lang LaSalle, UNDP, <b>European</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Federation,</b> and Transparency International, and compares transition economies with non-transition economies of similar level of development to see if there remain distinct 'transition' differences. Findings - The initial findings indicate convergence {{under the influence of the}} EU, World Bank and FAO but also differences from market economies in areas such as property market transparency, strength of property rights and land governance. Research limitations/implications - There is a need for better quality data on transition countries' property markets. Practical implications - The differences suggest that transition economies continue to require specific policies for the development of their property markets. Originality/value - Whilst there have been studies of 'transition' factors generally in economies, there have not been ones that look specifically at property markets...|$|E

Its main aim is the research and analysis ot the market with mortgage bonds and mortgage loans in the Czech and Slovak Republic. The work also takes into concern the so discussed integration of <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first two chapters are theoretical and are focused on the legislature and the feature of bonds and mortgage bonds. One of the components is the problem of mortgage banks and mortgage loans. The practical section is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is focused on the position of mortgage banks in the Czech and Slovak Republics in the framework of the bank´s sector in the given country. The banks are evaluated on the basis of economic criteria including balance sheets, net profit, initial capital, capital feasibility, number of branches and number of employees. The final part of this section is the evaluation and comprison of the Czech and Slovak bank sectors and their comparison with the European Union. The second chapter deals with entities conducting in the field of mortgage banking and the evaluation of their position in the framework of the Czech and Slovak Republic.

40|$|Quantile {{regression}} {{is applied}} in two retail credit risk assessment exercises exemplifying {{the power of}} the technique to account for the diverse distributions that arise in the financial service industry. The first application is to predict loss given default for secured loans, in particular retail mortgages. This is an asymmetric process since where the security (such as a property) value exceeds the loan balance the banks cannot retain the profit, whereas when the security does not cover the value of the defaulting loan then the bank realises a loss. In the light of this asymmetry it becomes apparent that estimating the low tail of the house value is much more relevant for estimating likely losses than estimates of the average value where in most cases no loss is realised. In our application quantile regression is used to estimate the distribution of property values realised on repossession that is then used to calculate loss given default estimates. An illustration is given for a mortgage portfolio from a <b>European</b> <b>mortgage</b> lender. A second application is to revenue modelling. While credit issuing organisations have access to large databases, they also build models to assess the likely effects of new strategies for which, by definition, there is no existing data. Certain strategies are aimed at increasing the revenue stream or decreasing the risk in specific market segments. Using a simple artificial revenue model, quantile regression is applied to elucidate the details of subsets of accounts, such as the least profitable, as predicted from their covariates. The application uses standard linear and kernel smoothed quantile regression...|$|R

Granger Causality tests indicate that non-fundamentally justified prices dynamics contributed to herding by lenders and that this behaviour was a response by the banks as a group to common information on residential property assets. In contrast, in Germany, Portugal and Austria, residential property prices were largely explained by fundamentals. Furthermore, these countries show no evidence of either irrational price bubbles or herd behaviour in the mortgage market. Granger Causality tests indicate that both variables are independent...|$|R

Particularly we define some variables to describe the underlying property portfolio and the behavior of the real estate market to test their significance in explaining CMBS spreads. Multiple linear regression analysis using a databank of A Tranches issued between 1997 and 2007 indicates a strong relationship with bond-related factors, followed by real estate and mortgage market conditions. As floater coupon tranches tend to be riskier and exhibit higher spreads, we also estimate a model using this sub-set of data only and results hold reinforcing our findings. Finally, we estimate our model for both tranches A and B and discuss main differences. ...|$|R
