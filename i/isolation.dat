5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in <b>isolation,</b> conjectured to be Beringia. The <b>isolation</b> of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic <b>isolation</b> or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive <b>isolation</b> to evolve.|$|E

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{patterns of}} respiratory virus <b>isolations</b> from 10 laboratories in the USA {{were compared with}} that of deaths of children < 5 years old from July 1975 through June 1984. Isola-tions of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) occurred as yearly winter outbreaks; parainfluenza vi-rus 1 and 2 <b>isolations</b> occurred as well-defined outbreaks every other year in the autumn; parainfluenza virus 3 <b>isolations</b> occurred throughout the year with periodic, increased <b>isolations</b> suggestive of outbreaks; and influenza virus <b>isolations</b> (A, B, or A plus B) occurred as yearly winter outbreaks. After data were controlled for seasonal patterns, RSV <b>isolations</b> were strongly correlated with the winter peaks in lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) deaths of infants 1 - 11 months old; influenza virus <b>isolations</b> were correlated with the winter peak in LRI deaths of children 24 - 59 months old. The parainfluenza viruses were not correlated with respiratory deaths. This study supports the idea that RSV is a major contributor to winter peaks in LRI deaths of children 1 - 11 months old. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most im-portant lower respiratory tract pathogen in infants and young children in developed countries [1 - 6]. In temperate climates...|$|R

5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive <b>isolation,</b> a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive <b>isolation</b> could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive <b>isolation,</b> leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic <b>isolation,</b> influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E

5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens was {{not included}} in the theatrical version of the film, since 20th Century Fox was concerned about the film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: <b>Isolation,</b> Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the best way to focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: <b>Isolation</b> she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: <b>Isolation</b> was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarReference {{materials}} containing Listeria monocytogenes {{were tested}} in a collaborative study held in june 1989. Fourty laboratories participated.

The median contamination level of the capsules was 9. 27. Based on a lognormal distribution at least 19 out of 20 <b>isolations</b> should be made. With the Standard Method 97 % of the capsules were found positive and 85 % of the laboratories made at least 19 <b>isolations.</b> The OWN method gave significantly less isolations; 85 % of the capsules were found positive and 55 % of the laboratories made at least 19 <b>isolations.</b> Four laboratories (10 %) reported false positive <b>isolations</b> with the negative control samples.

An adapted ISO 6579 (proposed reference) method was used in combination with MSRV and, optionally, the laboratory's own routine method for the detection of Salmonella in chicken faeces.

5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} <b>isolation</b> for 80 {{million years}} and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants.

About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
