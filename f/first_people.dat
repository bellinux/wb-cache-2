5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the <b>first</b> <b>people</b> to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the meaning of prison quality for Australian <b>First</b> <b>Peoples,</b> the authors examine the aspects of prison considered to be positive and negative for <b>First</b> <b>Peoples</b> serving sentences of imprisonment in the Kimberley Region in Western Australia. The meaning of prison quality as experienced by <b>First</b> <b>Peoples</b> is compared with the meaning of prison quality as defined by an existing measure of the quality of prison life. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with 25 prisoners and staff members from West Kimberley Regional Prison and Broome Regional Prison, seven key aspects of prison as experienced by <b>First</b> <b>Peoples</b> are identified. Six of these key aspects, respect and courtesy, staff-prisoner relationships, bureaucratic legitimacy, fairness, family contact, and personal development, are consistent with dimensions previously identified as pertaining to the quality of prison life. An additional culture-traditions dimension was also identified. The findings show that the differences between prison quality as experienced by <b>First</b> <b>Peoples</b> and non-Indigenous peoples are influenced by aspects relevant to the culture and traditions of <b>First</b> <b>Peoples.</b> The authors highlight the importance of considering culture and traditions in understanding the meaning of prison quality for <b>First</b> <b>Peoples.</b> Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Criminology and Criminal JusticeFull Tex...|$|R

5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>people</b> he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress.

They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware.

Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front.

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>people</b> are {{estimated}} to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000years ago. By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as Tsenacommacah. The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west, and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, {{to the north and}} south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network. Powhatan controlled more than 30smaller tribes and over 150settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>people</b> {{known to}} live in the Catlins, Māori of the Kāti Mamoe, Waitaha, and Kāi Tahu iwi (tribes), merged via {{marriage}} and conquest into the iwi now known as Kāi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from Stewart Island/Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to the best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by Maeroero (wild giants).|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>people</b> {{to rush to}} the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
