5|$|The modern koala is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around {{the same size as}} the modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the <b>incisor</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the development and}} testing {{of a system that}} measures forces exerted by the tongue and upper lip on a tooth during rest and during swallowing. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects, aged 19 - 31 years (mean: 23. 2 years) were submitted to measurement of forces exerted by the upper lip and tongue on the maxillary right central <b>incisor</b> <b>tooth.</b> Flexiforce resistive sensors were fixed on the labial and lingual surfaces of the tooth.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the dam is to create {{deepwater}} refugia enabling the beaver to escape from predators. When deep water is already present in lakes, rivers, or larger streams, the beaver may dwell in a bank burrow and bank lodge with an underwater entrance. The beaver dam is constructed using branches from trees the beavers cut down, as well as rocks, grass, and mud. The inner bark, twigs, shoots, and leaves of such trees are also {{an important part of}} the beaver's diet. The trees are cut down using their strong <b>incisor</b> <b>teeth.</b> Their front paws are used for digging and carrying and placing materials. The sound of running water dictates when and where a beaver builds its dam. Besides providing a safe home for the beaver, beaver ponds also provide habitat for waterfowl, fish, and other aquatic animals. Their dams help reduce soil erosion and can help reduce flooding. However, beaver dams are not permanent and depend on the beavers' continued presence for their maintenance. Beavers generally concentrate on building and repairing dams in the fall in preparation for the coming winter. In northern areas, they often do not repair breaches in the dam made by otters, and sometimes breach the dam themselves and lower the water level in the pond to create more breathing space under the ice or get easier access to trees below the dam. In a 1988 study in Alberta, Canada, no beavers repaired [...] "sites of water loss" [...] during the winter. Of 178 sites of water loss, beavers repaired 78 when water was opened, and did not repair 68. The rest were partially repaired.|$|E
