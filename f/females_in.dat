5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} <b>females.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, <b>females</b> <b>in</b> aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E
5|$|<b>Females</b> <b>in</b> estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating.

5|$|However, {{mitochondrial}} DNA reflects {{only the}} history of the <b>females</b> <b>in</b> a population and so may not represent {{the history of}} the population as a whole.

5|$|The {{loudness}} of {{the song}} is correlated {{with the size of}} the male {{and the quality of the}} habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness.

5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner.

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. <b>Females</b> <b>in</b> oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to <b>females</b> <b>in</b> other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
