40|$|Steps towards {{implementing}} a collision based two-qubit gate in optical lattices have previously been realized by the parallel merging all pairs of atoms in a periodicity two superlattice. In contrast, we propose an architecture {{which allows for}} the merger of a selected qubit pair in a novel long-periodicity superlattice structure consisting of two optical lattices with close-lying periodicity. We numerically optimize the <b>gate</b> <b>time</b> and fidelity, including the effects on neighboring atoms, and {{in the presence of}} experimental sources of error. Furthermore, the superlattice architecture induces a differential hyperfine shift, allowing for single-qubit gates. The fastest possible single-qubit <b>gate</b> <b>times,</b> given a maximal tolerable rotation error on the remaining atoms at various values of the lattice wavelengths, are identified. We find that robust single- and two-qubit <b>gates</b> with <b>gate</b> <b>times</b> of a few 100 μs and with error probabilities ∼ 10 ^- 3 are possible. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Polarization {{switching}} of picosecond laser pulses is {{a fundamental}} concept in signal processing [C. Chen and G. Liu, Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. 16, 203 (1986); V. R. Almeida et al., Nature 431, 1081 (2004); and A. A. P. Pohl et al., Photonics Sens. 3, 1 (2013) ]. Conventional switching devices rely on the electro-optical Pockels effect and work at radio frequencies. The ensuing <b>gating</b> <b>time</b> of several nanoseconds is a bottleneck for faster switches which is set by the performance of state-of-the-art high-voltage electronics. Here we show that by substituting the electric field of several kV/cm provided by modern electronics by the MV/cm field of a single-cycle THz laser pulse, the electro-optical gating process can be driven orders of magnitude faster, at THz frequencies. In this context, we introduce diamond as an exceptional electro-optical material and demonstrate a pulse <b>gating</b> <b>time</b> as fast as 100 fs using sub-cycle THz-induced Kerr nonlinearity. We show that THz-induced switching in the insulator diamond is fully governed by the THz pulse shape. The presented THz-based electro-optical approach overcomes the bandwidth and switching speed limits of conventional MHz/GHz electronics and establishes the ultrafast electro-optical gating technology {{for the first time}} in the THz frequency range. We finally show that the presented THz polarization gating technique is applicable for advanced beam diagnostics. As a first example, we demonstrate tomographic reconstruction of a THz pulse in three dimensions...|$|E

40|$|Fast {{entangling}} gates for trapped ion pairs offer {{vastly improved}} <b>gate</b> operation <b>times</b> relative to implemented gates, {{as well as}} approaches to trap scaling. Gates on a neighbouring ion pair only involve local ions when performed sufficiently fast, and we find that even a fast gate between a pair of distant ions with few degrees of freedom restores all the motional modes given more stringent gate speed conditions. We compare pulsed fast gate schemes, defined by a timescale faster than the trap period, and find that our proposed scheme has less stringent requirements on laser repetition rate for achieving arbitrary <b>gate</b> <b>time</b> targets and infidelities well below 10 − 4. By extending gate schemes to ion crystals, we explore the effect of ion number on gate fidelity for coupling two neighbouring ions in large crystals. Inter-ion distance determines the <b>gate</b> <b>time,</b> and a factor of five increase in repetition rate, or correspondingly the laser power, reduces the infidelity by almost two orders of magnitude. We also apply our fast gate scheme to entangle {{the first and last}} ions in a crystal. As the number of ions in the crystal increases, significant increases in the laser power are required to provide the short <b>gate</b> <b>times</b> corresponding to fidelity above 0. 99.

At injection current of 80 mA,a 3 dB optical bandwidth {{of more than}} 85 nm is achieved due to dominant band-filling effect. Moreover, {{the most important is}} that very low polarization dependence of gain (＜ 0. 7 dB),fiber-to-fiber lossless operation current (70 ～ 90 mA) and a high extinction ratio (＞ 50 dB) are simultaneously obtained over this wide 3 dB optical bandwidth (1520 ～ 1609 nm) which nearly covers the spectral region of the whole C band (1525 ～ 1565 nm) and the whole L band (1570 ～ 1610 nm).

40|$|We {{found that}} the actual {{computational}} time-cost of the QFT is O(n 2 ^n) for large n in a quantum computer using nuclear spins. The computational cost of a quantum algorithm has usually been estimated as {{the sum of the}} universal gates required in such ideal mathematical models as the Quantum Turing Machine(QTM) and the quantum circuit. This cost is proportional to an actual time-cost in the physical implementation where all quantum operations can be achieved in the same time.

40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} at LNLS to perform bunch cleaning in the booster synchrotron injector {{to satisfy the}} requests for single-bunch runs either for time-resolved experiments or machine studies.

This fast switching is achieved through the utilization of a double balanced mixer. The switched excitation signal is amplified and applied to a stripline kicker. A PECL timing card supplies the gating signal, synchronized to the fRF, which (negatively) modulates the excitation carrier.

40|$|Excitonic {{transitions}} offer {{a possible}} route to ultrafast optical spin manipulation in coupled nanostructures. We perform here a {{detailed study of}} the three principal exciton-mediated decoherence channels for optically controlled electron spin qubits in coupled quantum dots: radiative decay of the excitonic state, exciton–phonon interactions, and Landau–Zener transitions between laser-dressed states. We consider a scheme for producing an entangling controlled-phase gate {{on a pair of}} coupled spins which, in its simplest dynamic form, renders the system subject to fast decoherence rates associated with exciton creation during the gating operation. In contrast, we show that an adiabatic approach employing off-resonant laser excitation allows us to suppress all sources of decoherence simultaneously, significantly increasing the fidelity of operations at only a relatively small <b>gating</b> <b>time</b> cost. We find that controlled-phase gates accurate to one part in 102 can realistically be achieved with the adiabatic approach, whereas the conventional dynamic approach does not appear to support a fidelity suitable for scalable quantum computation.

40|$|Each gating {{mechanism}} controlling permeability in a membrane may {{be influenced}} by only a few charge binding sites on the membrane surface, so that fluctuations in the occupancy of these sites are important. Tow extreme cases arise. (a) The time scale of these fluctuations is much shorter than the <b>gating</b> <b>time</b> constant. Then the gating mechanisms are subject to a rapidly varying electric field. If the gating in the absence of these fluctuations obeys exponential kinetics, so does the gating {{in the presence of the}} fluctuations. Changes in surface charge do not simply shift the gating variable curves on the voltage axis, but also change their shape. Such effects are seen experimentally and cannot be explained in terms of conventional surface charge theory. If the activation curve in the absence of any surface charge binding is symmetric about the half-activation point, when some of the surface charge sites are occupied the activation curve is in general asymmetric. (b) The fluctuations occur much more slowly than the gating reaction. There are several pools of channels present with different time constant and activation curves. Again the activation curve is asymmetric about the half-activation point, and its shape is changed by alterations in the surface charge.

40|$|The {{classical}} Hodgkin [...] Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion {{concentrations in}} spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore {{limited to a}} time scale of milliseconds, which {{is determined by the}} membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the <b>gating</b> <b>time</b> constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.
