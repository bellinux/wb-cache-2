5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals <b>have</b> <b>very</b> large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} of {{an orbit}} describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System <b>have</b> <b>very</b> low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits. Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as {{well as several}} extrasolar planets) <b>have</b> <b>very</b> high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, {{semiconductor}} technology was introduced into timebase circuits.

5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they <b>have</b> <b>very</b> poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast to <b>have</b> <b>very</b> demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower {{than what is}} recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
