40|$|Abstract: Research on {{cognitive}} theories about programming learning suggests that experienced programmers solve problems {{by looking for}} previous solutions that are related with the new problem {{and that can be}} adapted to the current situation. On the other hand, an apprentice who does not have any previous programming experiences in mind can only appeal to the sentences of the language that he had learned so far.

In this model, learning {{can be seen as a}} process of pattern recognition, which compares experiences from the past with the current situation. In this work, we present a programming environment in which a student can program using a set of pedagogical patterns, i. e., elementary programming patterns recommended by a group of teachers. In this environment, while the student is editing a program, he can select and <b>insert</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to satisfy subgoals of a given problem. After having a compiled program, the student can submit it to a diagnosis system for detection of (i) possible errors and/or (ii) student's misconceptions on the use of patterns.

However, design of the aperture pattern plays a very critical role. Previous approaches for designing aperture codes make simple assumptions on image distributions to obtain metrics for evaluating aperture codes. However, real images may not follow those assumptions and hence the designed code may not be optimal for them. To address this drawback we propose a data driven approach for learning the optimal aperture pattern to recover depth map from a single coded image. We propose a two stage architecture where, in the first stage we simulate coded aperture images from a training dataset of all-focus images and depth maps and in the second stage we recover the depth map using a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our learned aperture code performs better than previously designed codes even on code design metrics proposed by previous approaches. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Watermarking is {{the process}} of <b>inserting</b> {{predefined}} <b>patterns</b> into multimedia data {{in a way that the}} degradation of quality is minimized and remain at an imperceptible level. Many digital watermarking algorithms have been proposed in special and transform domains. The techniques in the spatial domain still have relatively low-bit capacity and are not resistant enough to lossy image compression and other image processing operations. For instance, a simple noise in the image may eliminate the watermark. On the other hand, frequency domain-based techniques can embed more bits for watermark and are more robust to attack. Some transforms such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used for watermarking in the frequency domain. In this thesis, we compare the DCT watermarking algorithms and especially the DWT watermarking algorithms based on robustness criteria. In other words, the robustness of different transform watermark algorithms is evaluated by applying different attacks. One main reason to consider the DWT watermarking algorithms is that several multimedia standards such as the JPEG 2000 and MPEG- 4 are based on the DWT.
