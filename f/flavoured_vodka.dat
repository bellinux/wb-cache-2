Some modern cold mixed absinthes have been bottled at strengths approaching 90% ABV. Others are presented simply as a bottle of plain alcohol with a small amount of powdered herbs suspended within it.|$|R

In 2014, Smirnoff {{was chosen as the}} best selling vodka across the world.The vodka is made using a traditional charcoal filtration method developed by P.A. Smirnoff. Recipe NO.21 was created by P.A.'s son Vladimir after escaping Russia and the Bolshevik revolution.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 the State alcohol {{monopoly}} was funded in Warsaw. Łańcut distillery {{managed to hold}} its position among the best companies in the country thanks to investments in equipment and innovations. The plant survived the outbreak of World War II largely intact, but it suffered major destruction in 1944 from the withdrawing German armies and advancing Russian units. In 1951 a state enterprise called Łańcut Spirits Industries was created out of the Łańcut Spirits Stock Company and Count Alfred Potocki's Privileged Distillery of Liqueurs, Rosoglios and Rum in Łańcut. In 1969 the plant was producing fifteen kinds of unflavoured and <b>flavoured</b> <b>vodkas,</b> about 200,000 bottles a day.|$|R
50|$|William Chase {{invested}} {{the proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} equity in Tyrrells to found the Chase Distillery, Ltd. in 2008. Initially, the distillery focused exclusively on producing high-quality potato vodka from potatoes grown on site. The construction of an exceptionally tall 70 ft rectification column enabled Chase Vodka to be distilled up to 119 times. Chase Vodka sales totalled £140,000 in the first year and the brand quickly achieved success on the export market. William Chase gradually developed and brought new products to market including fruit liqueurs (notably Chase Elderflower Liqueur) and <b>flavoured</b> <b>vodkas</b> (e.g. Chase Marmalade Vodka and Chase Smoked English Oak Vodka).|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study {{designed to assess}} the impact of the multisensory atmosphere (involving variations in lighting and music) on people’s rating of unflavoured and flavoured (citron and raspberry) vodkas is reported. The auditory and visual attributes of the environment were changed as people tasted, and then rated, four unlabelled glasses of vodka (two unflavoured samples, one sample of citron-flavoured and one sample of raspberry-flavoured vodka). Due to the public nature of the event, all participants experienced the same order of auditory and visual changes at the same time. For <b>flavoured</b> <b>vodkas,</b> we saw significant correlations between atmosphere-vodka matching and both liking and fruitiness, and this was reinforced by results showing that those participants who tasted the vodkas in congruent atmospheric conditions (raspberry vodka in red lighting and sweet music, citron vodka in green lighting and sour music) gave significantly higher ratings of liking and fruitiness than did those participants who tasted the vodkas in atmospheric conditions that were incongruent. Specifically, the participants liked the raspberry-flavoured vodka significantly more, and rated it as tasting significantly fruitier, under red lighting while listening to sweet music as compared to under green lighting and listening to sour music. Meanwhile, the unflavoured vodka was liked less under green lighting while listening to the putatively sour music than under white lighting and no music. These results demonstrate how the multisensory attributes of the environment impact on people’s experience of both unflavoured and <b>flavoured</b> <b>vodkas,</b> even when they are not given any information about what they are tasting. Some of the real-world implications for bars (i. e., the “on trade”), experiential events, and other beverage businesses are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a {{grandson}} and heir of the Duchess, {{started to run}} the Łańcut and Lwów Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties, and implemented the Schwartz distillation equipment. The production of premium vodkas, liqueurs, creams and ratafias was started, in addition to regular and anise <b>flavoured</b> <b>vodkas.</b> The estate ran two company outlets in Lwów and Vienna. In 1882 Alfred Józef Potocki created a network of agents to promote sales in Galicia and Austria-Hungary. Trains of the Viennese rail lines passing through the town of Łańcut used to make longer stops to allow travellers to buy the distilleries' famous products. In 1900, Count Alfred Potocki's Distillery {{won a gold medal}} at the International Exposition in Paris for his array of products. Between 1911-1912 Roman Potocki moved the plant to a newly equipped building. Some of the buildings were destroyed with the eruption of World War I. The difficulties were helped by establishing a stock company in 1917.|$|R

5000|$|Coumarin {{is often}} found in {{artificial}} vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, {{largely because of the}} hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among [...] "Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food", according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed [...] "in alcoholic beverages only" [...] (21 CFR 172.510).

50|$|Kubanskaya is a Russian, <b>flavoured</b> {{brand of}} <b>vodka</b> or nastoyka {{with a touch}} of lemon. 40% alcohol. Bottle volume 50cl. The highly {{recognizable}} label http://media.photobucket.com/image/kubanskaya+vodka+/alivebarmaley/Vodka/Kubanskaya.jpg on the bottle depicts a Cossack on a horse.The original Kubanskaya was produced by the renowned Kristall vodka factory in Moscow, the origin of Stolichnaya vodka. The beverage became insanely popular among expatriates living in Moscow during the 1990s, due to its pleasant taste and the relatively low hangover risk. Another major factor leading to this popularity was the cult song Kubanskaya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oioTyE0uMAA by the Zelenograd rock group NTO Retsept http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_rus_rock/373/НТО. This song, in turn, was inspired by the brief cameo this vodka made in the underground novel Moscow-Petushki.The 1998 Russian financial crisis triggered an exodus of the Moscow expats. Consequently, Kristall ceased production of Kubanskaya. Kubanskaya vodka is still for sale in Russian stores, but is produced by less-known factories. While the taste resembles the taste of the original Kristall brand, connaisseurs are able to taste the difference.|$|R
5000|$|Curonians {{are one of}} the Baltic tribes. Their Culture, {{religion}} and architecture are similar to those found in Germany and Sweden. Curonians are related with Lithuanians and Latvians. The Kuršininkai were predominantly Lutheran, like most former inhabitants of East Prussia, although some ancient pagan customs were preserved. Most Kuršininkai were bilingual or even trilingual: the Curonian language was used within the family and while fishing, German was used in everyday communication, and the language of church services was German and Lithuanian. The Kuršininkai were primarily fishermen. Some elements of cuisine are named after Kuršininkai, for example Curonian coffee (Kurenkaffee); a drink made of <b>vodka</b> <b>flavoured</b> with coffee, honey and other ingredients was popular throughout East Prussia.The first who took an interest in Kuršininkai culture and language was Paul Kwauka, a member of the separatist movement of Memel Territory. His book [...] "Kurisches Wörterbuch" [...] is a highly valuable source of information.The work of describing their heritage is continued by one of the last remaining Curonians, Richard Pietsch.|$|R
