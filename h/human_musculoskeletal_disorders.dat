40|$|Abstract: Efficacious bone {{regeneration}} could {{revolutionize the}} clinical management of many bone and <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Bone has the unique ability to regenerate and continuously remodel itself throughout life. However, clinical situations arise when bone {{is unable to}} heal itself, as with segmental bone loss, fracture non-union, and failed spinal fusion. This leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Current attempts at improved bone healing have been met with limited success, fueling the development of improved techniques. Gene therapy in many ways represents an ideal approach for augmenting bone regeneration. Gene therapy allows specific gene products to be delivered to a precise anatomic location. In addition, the level of transgene expression {{as well as the}} duration of expression can be regulated with current techniques. For bone regeneration, the gene of interest should be delivered to the fracture site, expressed at appropriate levels, and then deactivated once the fracture has healed. Delivery of biological factors, mostly bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), has yielded promising results both in animal and clinical studies. There has also been tremendous work on discovering new growth factors and exploring previously defined ones. Finally, significant advances are being made in the delivery systems of the genes, ranging from viral and non-viral vectors to tissue engineering scaffolds. Despite some public hesitation to gene therapy, its use has great potential to expand our ability to treat a variety of <b>human</b> bone and <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is conceivable that in the near future gene therapy can be utilized to induce bone formation in virtually any region of the body in a minimally invasive manner.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) It is well {{established}} that dental hygienists are commonly affected by <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, due {{to the complexity of}} this occupational health issue, an understanding of the progression of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> and strategies for prevention are far from being understood. The aim of this thesis is to establish the prevalence and correlates of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> among the previously understudied demographic of dental hygienists and dental hygiene students, and to also investigate the effect of loupes as an intervention for this problem. To meet this aim, three research projects were undertaken. A systematic review of the evidence confirmed that <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> are reported by dental hygienists at consistently high rates; however, a lack of longitudinal studies and standardised research techniques limited any conclusions about the progression of disease or successful interventions. A longitudinal cohort study followed dental hygiene students across the three years of their education and training, to determine whether <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> begin even before their careers begin. Dental hygiene students reported <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> at rates similar to practising hygienists. A cross sectional study of Australian dental hygienists identified that both work-related tasks and psychosocial factors influence the reporting of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders,</b> and that equipment such as loupes may have a protective effect. An intervention study investigated the effect of loupes on <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> among a sample of dental hygienists; both positive and negative outcomes for physical measures were noted. Overall, the findings in this thesis provide evidence that <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> begin during dental hygiene training, are prevalent in a relatively young and recently established group of practicing dental hygienists, and are influenced by a multitude of factors. Furthermore, it appears that loupes might not be a panacea for optimal musculoskeletal health, at least in dental hygienists. Recommendations for future studies in this field are provided...|$|R

Employment rates increased and social differentials narrowed in the general population, while employment declined and social differentials widened among patients with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> These trends were masked when analyses were restricted to individuals employed at baseline. Following hospital admission, the odds of leaving employment increased annually for patients; by 2001, their adjusted odds were over three times greater [odds ratio (OR) = 3. 36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 89 – 3. 91] than for the general population. Women with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} leave employment during follow-up than men (OR= 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 49 – 2. 56). Semi- and unskilled manual workers with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> were over three times as likely to leave employment than their professional counterparts (OR= 3. 40, 95 % CI 2. 41 – 4. 81). Conclusions. People with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders,</b> particularly women and semi- and unskilled manual workers, are vulnerable to leaving employment.

40|$|Background Individual {{factors are}} usually {{important}} as non-occupational parameters that {{participate in the}} prevalence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Personality traits {{are one of the}} individual factors that affect physical illness, which are constant over time, thereby reflecting stable individual differences. Identifying the personality trait can be used to predict <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> in workers and select individual with appropriate personality traits for different works. Objectives The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify the personality traits used to determine the relationship between different personality traits and the prevalence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods 136 people of 2 different companies in Tabriz (in 2015) were selected as the study population. The first group was selected from the petrochemical repair workers and the second from a dairy factory. The 50 -item version of Goldberg’s big five personality scale was used to assess the personality traits. Nordic questionnaire was employed to evaluate the prevalence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Chi-square test was incorporated for analyzing the data. Finally, logistic regression test was used to study the factors affecting upper and lower body pain. Results Results indicated that individual personality traits were associated with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorder</b> prevalence in some members of body: Extraversion with wrist (P-value = 0. 013) and hip (P-value = 0. 044), emotional stability with shoulder (P-value = 0. 012), wrist (P-value = 0. 043), back (P-value = 0. 034), low back (P-value = 0. 029) and ankle(P-value = 0. 014), Conscientiousness with Hip (P-value = 0. 009), Agreeableness with shoulder (P-value = 0. 004), back (P-value = 0. 001), Hip (P-value = 0. 006) and ankle (P-value = 0. 019). Conclusions According to the results of this study, the personality traits can contribute to <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Therefore, notice of personality traits can be used to predict individuals who are prone to <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> Necessary actions may be tailored for the people that are proportional to individual personality traits to prevent <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> As a further study, it is recommended that a better relationship may be revealed between personality traits and <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
