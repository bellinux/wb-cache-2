5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by one of its affiliates.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare contribution <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by individuals with contribution <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by group representatives. We present the results from a laboratory experiment that compares <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by individuals in inter-individual public good games with <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by representatives on behalf of their group in inter-group public good games. Our main finding is that contribution behavior differs between individuals and group representatives, but only for women. While men’s choices are equally self-interested as individuals and group representatives, women make less self-interested choices as group representatives...|$|R

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E

The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet.

The first <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> was to create a game about chocobos, market research showed that the characters are most popular with younger players, thus the game was designed for the Nintendo DS system, a popular system with that age group.|$|E
40|$|Procedural reasons, {{unlike other}} reasons for {{invalidity}} of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the Assembly in a Limited liability company (hereinafter:Ltd) in the judicial and business practice open up {{the highest number of}} legal questions. These are “mistakes in the steps” that lead to invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the Assembly in Ltd. about which in the domestic legal literature has not been systematically discussed. The starting point for the elaboration of this issue is based on the circumstance that in the provision of article 448 of the Companies Act is stipulated that to the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the Assembly in Ltd. appropriately apply the provisions on the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the General Assembly in PLC (Public Limited Company). Procedural differences in working of the General Assembly in PLC and Assembly in Ltd. is one of the fundamental differences between these two types of capital companies and this kind of positive legal regulation leads to legal uncertainty and misinterpretations. The first part of this paper gives a chronological overview of the domestic law with regard to invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the Assembly in Ltd. Then are doctrinally deferred invalid decisions from the other decisions with defect. Then, each provision on the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the General Assembly in PLC is tested and then explicitly formulated provision which is valid only within the context of Ltd. Apart from domestic law are analyzed also solutions from comparative law (especially German) because domestic law largely overlaps with the solutions from comparative law. In conclusion after completion of analysis, the obtained findings are used as guidelines for more practical de lege ferenda regulation in the Companies Act regarding the invalidity of <b>decisions</b> <b>made</b> by the Assembly in Ltd...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E
5|$|Central Coast Mariners' {{bid for a}} {{franchise}} in the Football Federation Australia's new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to {{the announcement of the}} franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.|$|E
