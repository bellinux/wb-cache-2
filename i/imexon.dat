50|$|<b>Imexon</b> (INN, {{trade name}} Amplimexon) is a {{substance}} that is being studied {{in the treatment of}} some types of cancer, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, melanoma, and multiple myeloma. It is a cyanoaziridine derivative.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Imexon</b> is an aziridine-containing small pro-oxidant {{molecule}} with promising antitumor {{activity in}} myeloma, lymphoma and lung and pancreatic cancer. <b>Imexon</b> {{is already in}} clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors. The present study {{examined the effects of}} <b>imexon</b> on H 9 and Raji lymphoma cell lines in vitro when given in combination with ionizing radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H 9 and Raji lymphoma cells were grown in culture and exposed to <b>imexon,</b> radiation, or both. Cells were assessed for cell viability, glutathione content, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and also subject to Western blot analysis. RESULTS: <b>Imexon</b> inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Imexon,</b> given for 48 h prior to irradiation at a clinically achievable dose of 40 muM, potently enhanced the cell radiosensitivity. <b>Imexon</b> enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis and accumulated cells in G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. <b>Imexon</b> induced caspase- 3 activation and PARP cleavage. Alterations in glutathione levels were not observed at 40 microM of <b>imexon.</b> CONCLUSION: In conclusion, <b>imexon</b> efficiently augmented lymphoma cell radiosensitivity independently of glutathione and the underlying mechanisms include induction of apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution...|$|E
40|$|<b>Imexon</b> is an iminopyrrolidone {{derivative}} {{that has}} selective antitumor activity in multiple myeloma. The exact mechanism of <b>imexon</b> action is unknown. In human 8226 myeloma cells, the cytotoxicity of <b>imexon</b> was schedule dependent and long exposures (≥ 48 hours) to low concentrations of <b>imexon</b> were most effective at inducing cytotoxicity. Our {{data suggest that}} <b>imexon</b> does not affect DNA, but it can alkylate thiols by binding to the sulfhydryl group. We have also shown by HPLC studies that in human 8226 myeloma cells, <b>imexon</b> depletes cellular stores of cysteine and glutathione (GSH). Oxidative stress in myeloma cells exposed to <b>imexon</b> was detected by staining with dihydroethidium (HE) and flow cytometry, and by immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody to 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) followed by confocal microscopy. This antibody can also recognize 8 -hydroxyguanine and 8 -hydroxyguanosine. The images showed increased levels of oxidized nucleotides in the cytoplasm of cells treated with <b>imexon.</b> Interestingly, 8 -OHdG staining was not observed in the nucleus of <b>imexon</b> treated cells, {{in contrast to the}} diffuse staining seen with t-butyl hydroperoxide. Myeloma cells exposed to <b>imexon</b> showed classic morphologic features of apoptosis on electron microscopy and phosphatidylserine exposure detected as Annexin-V binding on the cell surface. Mitochondrial enlargement was observed by electron microscopy in the cells treated with 90 μM <b>imexon</b> at as early as 4 hours. Morphometric studies indicated that mitochondrial volume significantly increased from 14. 1 % in control cells to 18. 7 % in cells treated with 45 μM <b>imexon</b> for 24 hours. In flow cytometric experiments it was shown that the increase in levels of ROS (measured by staining with dihydroethidium) in myeloma cells exposed to <b>imexon</b> precedes the loss of Δψ(m) (detected by MitoTracker Red labeling). Damage of mitochondrial DNA was detected by semiquantitative PCR assay in myeloma cells treated with imexon; however nuclear DNA remained unaffected by <b>imexon</b> treatment. Moreover, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol was observed in <b>imexon</b> treated cells. Partial protection of myeloma cells against <b>imexon</b> cytotoxicity was achieved by treatment with theonyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of superoxide production at mitochondrial complex 11. Myeloma cell line was developed that is stably resistant to <b>imexon.</b> This cell line shows an increase in the expression of mitochondrial proteins (e. g. Bcl- 2, thioredoxin 2) with antioxidant properties. These changes are consistent with drug-induced mitochondrial oxidation and apoptotic signaling...|$|E

40|$|<b>Imexon</b> is an iminopyrrolidone {{aziridine}} which previously {{has shown}} activity against {{a variety of}} human cancer types, including multiple myeloma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Recently, mechanistic studies in the MIA PaCa- 2 human pancreatic cancer cell line have demonstrated binding to sulfhydryls, build-up of reactive oxygen species (ROS), perturbations in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9. Because <b>imexon</b> binds sulfhydryls and generates ROS, {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>imexon</b> would have considerable activity against pancreatic cancer by promoting oxidative stress in cells which are already oxidatively challenged and in combination with gemcitabine by interacting with key sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes involved with gemcitabine metabolism. In vitro anti-tumor activity of <b>imexon</b> and gemcitabine was evaluated in PANC- 1, MIA PaCa- 2, MutJ, and BxPC- 3 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Interactions between <b>imexon</b> and gemcitabine were assessed with simultaneous drug exposure at a fixed (imexon: gemcitabine) ratio using median effect analysis. The PANC- 1, MutJ, and BxPC- 3 cells demonstrated synergy with combination treatment. Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice bearing PANC- 1 cells treated with <b>imexon</b> and gemcitabine demonstrated tumor growth inhibition and regression. <b>Imexon</b> inhibited ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) at drug concentrations ≥ 100 μMol. This is similar to the selective RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea, suggesting that <b>imexon</b> may enhance gemcitabine-mediated inhibition of RNR as a mechanism of synergy. An S phase accumulation of PANC- 1 cells occurred at ≥ 300 μMol <b>imexon</b> at 24 hr. This was associated with a ≥ 2 -fold increase of radiolabeled gemcitabine incorporation into PANC- 1 DNA at ≥ 100 μMol <b>imexon.</b> Therefore the mechanisms of synergy between <b>imexon</b> and gemcitabine appear to include: (1) cell cycle arrest in S-phase, and (2) inhibition of RNR. Both actions would increase the uptake of the active metabolite, gemcitabine-triphosphate, (GEM-TP), into DNA. Arresting cells in S-phase would increase the time of cellular incorporation of deoxynucleotides, including GEM-TP, into DNA. Similarly, RNR inhibition reduces the availability of normal deoxynucleotides which compete with GEM-TP for incorporation. Overall, these data demonstrate that <b>imexon</b> is uniquely synergistic with gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo and support the rationale for combining the agents in clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{protein folding}} in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) requires strict regulation of redox homeostasis. Disruption of the lumenal redox balance induces an integrated ER stress response that {{is associated with}} reduced protein translation, increased chaperone activity, and ultimately cell death. <b>Imexon</b> is a small-molecule chemo-therapeutic agent that has been shown to bind glutathione (GSH) and induce oxidative stress in tumor cells; however, the mechanism of cytotoxicity is not well understood. In this report, we investigate the effects of <b>imexon</b> on the integrated ER stress response in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Acute exposure to <b>imexon</b> induces an ER stress response characterized by accumulation of the oxidized form of the oxidoreductase Ero 1 a, phosphorylation of eIF 2 a, and inhibition of protein synthesis. An RNA interference chemosensitization screen identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF 2 B 5 as a target that enhanced imexon-induced growth inhibition of MiaPaCa- 2 pancreatic cancer cells, but did not significantly augment the effects of <b>imexon</b> on protein synthesis. Concurrent reduction of intracellular thiols with N-acetyl cysteine reversed <b>imexon</b> activity, however cotreatment with superoxide scavengers had no effect, suggesting thiol binding may be a primary component of the oxidative effects of <b>imexon.</b> Moreover, the data suggest that disruption of the redox balance in the ER is a potential therapeutic target.

40|$|<b>Imexon,</b> a pro-oxidant small molecule, has {{antitumor}} {{activity in}} preclinical models. The drug induces apoptosis through accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The {{purpose of this}} trial was to define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynam-ics of <b>imexon</b> in patients with advanced cancers. Patients and Methods Forty-nine patients with metastatic cancer received intravenous <b>imexon</b> over 30 to 45 minutes for 5 consecutive days (one course) every other week (days 1 through 5 and 15 through 19) monthly. Doses were initially escalated using an accelerated trial design and then a modified Fibonacci method. Plasma <b>imexon</b> levels and six different thiols were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography assays. Results There were 13 dose levels evaluated, from 20 mg/m 2 /d to 1, 000 mg/m 2 /d. The MTD recom-mended for phase II studies was 875 mg/m 2 /d for 5 days every 2 weeks (n 9 patients). The two dose-limiting toxicities at 1, 000 mg/m 2 /d involved grade 3 abdominal pain and fatigue and grade 4 neutropenia, which occurred in one patient each. Other common toxicities included nausea and vomiting (58 %) and constipation (63 %); both were managed well with prophylactic medications. One partial response was obtained in a heavily pretreated patient with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Pharmacokinetic studies showed dose-independent clearance, with a 95 -minute mean half-life. Plasma thiol studies showed a dose- and area under the curve–dependent decrease in cystine levels 8 hours after dosing at 750 mg/m 2 /d. Conclusion The phase II recommended dose of <b>imexon</b> is 875 mg/m 2 /d for 5 days every other week. A decrease in plasma thiols did correlate with <b>imexon</b> exposure.

40|$|Induction of {{oxidative}} stress {{is a key}} component of cancer therapy. Pro-oxidant drugs have been demonstrated to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. An emerging concept is that therapeutic outcomes are dictated by the differential redox buffering reserve in subpopulations of malignant cells, indicating the need for noninvasive biomarkers of tumor redox {{that can be used for}} dose identification and response assessment in a longitudinal setting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced with the thiol-binding contrast agent Gd-LC 6 -SH, and hemodynamic response imaging (HRI) in combination with hypercapnia and hyperoxia were investigated as biomarkers of the pharmacodynamics of the small molecule pro-oxidant <b>imexon</b> (IMX). Human multiple myeloma cell lines 8226 /S and an IMX-resistant variant, 8226 /IM 10, were established as contralateral tumors in SCID mice. T 1 slope, an MRI measure of the washout rate of Gd-LC 6 -SH, was significantly lower post-IMX therapy in 8226 /S tumors compared with vehicle controls, indicating treatment-related oxidization of the tumor microenvironment, which was confirmed by analysis of tumor tissue for thiols. T 1 slope and ex vivo assays for thiols both indicated a more reduced microenvironment in 8226 /IM 10 tumors following IMX therapy. HRI with hypercapnia challenge revealed IMX inhibition of vascular dilation in 8226 /S tumors but not 8226 /IM 10 tumors, consistent with decreased immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin in treated 8226 /S tumors.

40|$|Peroxiredoxin- 3 (Prdx 3) is a {{mitochondrial}} {{member of}} the antioxidant family of thioredoxin peroxidases that uses mitochondrial thioredoxin- 2 (Trx 2) {{as a source of}} reduc-ing equivalents to scavenge hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Low levels of H 2 O 2 produced by the mitochondria regulate physiological processes, including cell prolif-eration, while high levels of H 2 O 2 are toxic to the cell and cause apoptosis. WEHI 7. 2 thymoma cells with stable overexpression of Prdx 3 displayed decreased levels of cellular H 2 O 2 and decreased cell proliferation without a change in basal levels of apoptosis. Prdx 3 -transfected cells showed a marked resistance to hypoxia-induced H 2 O 2 formation and apoptosis. Prdx 3 overexpression also protected the cells against apoptosis caused by H 2 O 2, t-butylhydroperoxide, and the anticancer drug <b>imexon,</b> but not by dexamethasone. Thus, mitochondrial Prdx 3 is an important cellular antioxidant that regulates physiological levels of H 2 O 2, leading to decreased cell growth while protecting cells from the apoptosis-inducing effects of high levels of H 2 O 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{immunomodulatory}} polysaccharide-rich substance (Noni-ppt) {{from the}} fruit juice of Morinda citrifolia {{has been found}} to possess both prophylactic and therapeutic potentials against the immunomodulator sensitive Sarcoma 180 tumour system. The antitumour activity of Noni-ppt produced a cure rate of 25 %– 45 % in allogeneic mice and its activity was completely abolished by the concomitant administration of specific inhi-bitors of macrophages (2 -chloroadenosine), T cells (cyclosporine) or natural killer (NK) cells (anti-asialo GM 1 antibody). Noni-ppt showed synergistic or additive beneficial effects when combined with a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, adriamycin, mitomycin-C, bleomycin, etoposide, 5 -fluorouracil, vincristine or camptothecin. It was not beneficial when combined with paclitaxel, cytosine arabinoside, or immunosuppressive anticancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or 6 -thioguanine. Noni-ppt also demonstrated beneficial effects when combined with the Th 1 cytokine, interferon gamma, but its activity was abolished when combined with Th 2 cytokines, interleukin- 4 or interleukin- 10, thereby suggesting that Noni-ppt induces a Th 1 dominant immune status in vivo. The combination of Noni-ppt with <b>imexon,</b> a synthetic immunomodulator, also demonstrated beneficial effects, but not when combined with the MVE- 2 copolymer...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of cancer is {{often accompanied by}} a loss of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular protrusion that functions as a cellular antenna and that puts a break on cell proliferation. Hence, restoration of the primary cilium in cancer cells may represent a novel promising approach to attenuate tumor growth. Using a high content analysis-based approach we screened a library of clinically evaluated compounds and marketed drugs {{for their ability to}} restore primary cilium expression in pancreatic ductal cancer cells. A diverse set of 118 compounds stimulating cilium expression was identified. These included glucocorticoids, fibrates and other nuclear receptor modulators, neurotransmitter regulators, ion channel modulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors, antibacterial compounds, protein inhibitors, microtubule modulators, and COX inhibitors. Certain compounds also dramatically affected the length of the cilium. For a selection of compounds (Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus, <b>Imexon</b> and Dexamethasone) their ability to restore ciliogenesis was confirmed in a panel of human cancer cell line models representing different cancer types (pancreas, lung, kidney, breast). Most compounds attenuated cell proliferation, at least in part through induction of the primary cilium, as demonstrated by cilium removal using chloral hydrate. These findings reveal that several commonly used drugs restore ciliogenesis in cancer cells, and warrant further investigation of their antineoplastic properties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{substantial}} progress {{made over the}} last decades {{in the treatment of}} cancer, there still is a great need for novel therapies. Especially for patients with advanced disease, chemotherapy is the best option. Nature is the primary source of anticancer drugs with compounds isolated from plants or micro-organisms. Moreover, the marine ecosystem provides for a growing number of promising agents in clinical trials. Besides natural resources, the increasing knowledge of tumour pathology and drug resistance mechanisms boosts the development of rationally designed anticancer agents, i. e. chemically synthesised derivatives of known anticancer agents exhibiting more favourable characteristics or development of novel biomolecularly engineered agents. It is rarely the case that a drug can be administered to humans as the pure chemical compound itself. Therefore, to enable evaluation of the novel anticancer drug in humans, a pharmaceutical formulation has to be developed. Anticancer agents at the early stage of development are generally administered as an intravenous bolus injection or infusion in order to obtain absolute bioavailibility, circumvent possible disturbance of or degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, {{and to be able to}} adjust or stop administration of the drug instantaneously in case of acute toxicity. Consequently, the development of a pharmaceutical formulation of a novel anticancer agent is focused on issues associated with the design of sterile and stable injectable products. This thesis describes the pharmaceutical development of three novel anticancer drugs, namely <b>Imexon</b> (chapter 1), C 1311 (chapter 2), and ES- 285. HCl (chapter 3). <b>Imexon</b> is a member of the class of 2 -cyanoaziridine derivatives and recent in vitro research demonstrated high cytotoxic activity for lymphoid malignancies, such as malignant lymphomas and multiple myeloma. C 1311 is the lead compound from the group of imidazoacridinones, a novel group of rationally designed anticancer drugs and exhibited significant cytotoxic activity in vitro towards several tumours and both in vitro and in vivo towards a range of colon tumours. ES- 285. HCl was originally derived from the marine clam Spisula polynyma. It has shown in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity against various tumour cell lines with selectivity for certain solid tumours (i. e. hepatocellular, prostate and renal). For each drug, the initial part of the chapter is dedicated to the development of a stability indicating assay for the novel anticancer drug. Moreover, the structural and analytical characterisation of the drug substance is described. Subsequently, the development of the pharmaceutical formulation and its stability upon storage is described. The chapters end with studies that were performed to evaluate the stability of the final formulated product in clinical practice, thus after reconstitution with an appropriate reconstitution solution and subsequent dilution in infusion solutions. Moreover, the (bio-) compatibility of the formulation solution with infusion systems and blood is described. The chapter dedicated to ES- 285. HCl is concluded with a study on the compatibility of platinum catalysed silicone tubing with the complexing excipient 2 -hydroxypropyl-Beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) used in the manufacture of ES- 285.

40|$|AbstractGd-LC 6 -SH is a thiol-bearing DOTA {{complex of}} {{gadolinium}} designed to bind plasma albumin at the conserved Cys 34 site. The binding of Gd-LC 6 -SH shows {{sensitivity to the}} presence of competing thiols. We hypothesized that Gd-LC 6 -SH could provide magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhancement that is sensitive to tumor redox state and that the prolonged retention of albumin-bound Gd-LC 6 -SH in vivo can be exploited to identify a saturating dose above which the shortening of MRI longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) of tissue is insensitive to the injected gadolinium dose. In the Mia-PaCa- 2 pancreatic tumor xenograft model in SCID mice, both the small-molecule Gd-DTPA-BMA and the macromolecule Galbumin MRI contrast agents produced dose-dependent decreases in tumor T 1. By contrast, the decreases in tumor T 1 provided by Gd-LC 6 -SH at 0. 05 and 0. 1 mmol/kg were not significantly different at longer times after injection. SCID mice bearing Mia-PaCa- 2 or NCI-N 87 tumor xenografts were treated with either the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine or the thiol-oxidizing anticancer drug <b>Imexon,</b> respectively. In both models, there was a significantly greater increase in tumor R 1 (= 1 /T 1) 60 minutes after injection of Gd-LC 6 -SH in drug-treated animals relative to saline-treated controls. In addition, Mercury Orange staining for nonprotein sulfhydryls was significantly decreased by drug treatment relative to controls in both tumor models. In summary, these studies show that thiol-bearing complexes of gadolinium such as Gd-LC 6 -SH can serve as redox-sensitive MRI contrast agents for detecting differences in tumor redox status and can be used to evaluate the effects of redox-active drugs...|$|E
