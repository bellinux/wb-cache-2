40|$|In a {{collaborative}} study involving six laboratories in the USA, Europe, and India the molecular weight distributions of {{a panel of}} <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> samples were determined, in order to compare <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> of bovine intestinal origin with that of bovine lung and porcine intestinal origin. Porcine samples met the current criteria as {{laid out in the}} USP <b>Heparin</b> <b>Sodium</b> monograph. Bovine lung heparin samples had consistently lower average molecular weights. Bovine intestinal heparin was variable in molecular weight; some samples fell below the USP limits, some fell within these limits and others fell above the upper limits. These data will inform the establishment of pharmacopeial acceptance criteria for <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> derived from bovine intestinal mucosa. The method for MW determination as described in the USP monograph uses a single, broad standard calibrant to characterize the chromatographic profile of <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> on high-resolution silica-based GPC columns.

Five patients in group 1 were between three and five years old. One patient was 1. 5 years old and six patients in group 2 were between three and five years old. During the procedure, group 1 received anterior chamber irrigation with <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (5 IU/cc) and 1 ml of <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (concentration 10 IU/ml) added to the irrigating balanced salt solution (BSS Plus; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) while group 2 received BSS without <b>heparin</b> <b>sodium</b> only.

In general, tests requiring whole blood call for blood samples collected in test tubes containing some form of the anticoagulant EDTA. EDTA chelates calcium to prevent clotting. EDTA is preferred for hematology tests because it does minimum damage to cell morphology. Sodium Citrate is the anticoagulant used in specimens collected for coagulation tests. The majority of chemistry and immunology tests are performed on serum, which is produced by clotting and then separating the blood specimen via centrifuge. These specimens are collected in either a non-additive tube or one containing a clotting activator. This clotting activator can interfere with some assays, and so a plain tube is recommended in these cases, but will delay testing. Tubes containing lithium <b>heparin</b> or <b>sodium</b> <b>heparin</b> are also commonly used for a variety of chemistry tests, as they do not require clotting and can be centrifuged immediately after collection.

Results: Heparin spray had analgesic, angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, and did not require secondary wound closure. Pain control was of fundamental importance to the patients; in the three cases, improvement in analgesia was achieved within 24 h of treatment.

40|$|Summary: P-Selectin {{represents}} a cell surface glycoprotein that is constitutively {{present in the}} Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and in the &alpha;-granules of platelets. In inflam-mation and thrombogenic conditions, plasmatic P-selectin lev-els are markedly elevated, indicating the leakage of this marker from these sites. In this study, a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing a monoclonal soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) antibody was employed to as-sess this marker in blood samples collected in various antico-agulants such as <b>heparin,</b> hirudin, <b>sodium</b> citrate (3. 2 % and 3. 8 %), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The soluble P-selectin levels ranged from 26 ng/mL to 44 ng/mL. Sodium citrate (3. 8 %) was used to collect platelet-poor plasma (PPP) from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), coronary angioplasty (CA), or coronary atherectom...|$|R
