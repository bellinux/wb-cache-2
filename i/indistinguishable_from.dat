5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E

5|$|Biopsy of {{the kidney}} may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} a second {{object in the}} same region, Pallas. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> {{several other}} morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> M.sextelata. Although there are subtle differences {{in the structure of}} the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent.|$|E

A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas.|$|E
5|$|Using light microscopy, {{the spores}} of Calvatia craniiformis are {{generally}} <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> those of C.rubroflava and C.gigantea; electron microscopy reveals that each has distinctive spore ornamentation. C.craniiformis features small, well-separated verrucae (wartlike projections) up to 0.2μm tall with rounded tips. In comparison, C.gigantea has larger verrucae (up to 0.4μm tall) {{that are more}} irregularly arranged.|$|E

5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> the noise.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

50|$|South Hamilton {{is not a}} town or a neighborhood. It is {{a postal}} address {{assigned}} to ZIP code 01982 by the Postal Service and is <b>indistinguishable</b> geographically <b>from</b> the town of Hamilton, Essex County, Massachusetts, United States (ZIP code 01936). This is shown by an absence of South Hamilton on the Massachusetts Secretary of State's list of all cities and towns in Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|Philpott {{stated that}} A. incompta was hardly <b>indistinguishable</b> in colour <b>from</b> A. orphnaea but that A. incompta differs as its antennal pectinations are shorter {{and it has}} less {{developed}} palpal hairs.|$|R
5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, a Miocene fossil {{alligator}}'s skull {{was found}} at Marion County, Florida. Unlike the other extinct alligator species of in the same genus, the fossil skull was virtually <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> that of the modern American alligator. This alligator and the American alligator are now considered to be sister taxa, meaning that the Alligator mississippiensis lineage has existed in North America for over 8 million years.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this trend {{is likely to increase}} in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
30|$|Elongation {{proportion}} is {{the proportion}} between {{the breadth of}} the hover of an <b>indistinguishable</b> range <b>from</b> the dendritic drainage of the sub basin (Schumm 1956 a, b) and the most extreme distance. It has a measure {{of the state of the}} stream basin and it relies upon the atmosphere and geologic sorts. The pappiredipatti watershed of elongation ratio is 0.785 which proposes that the bowl has a place with the prolonged shape (Strahler 1964). Miller points out (1953) characterized dimensionless circularity ratio as the proportion of the zone to the range of circle having an <b>indistinguishable</b> edge <b>from</b> the sub basin. A circularity ratio of the watershed is 8.35 which shows emphatically stretched and exceedingly penetrable homogenous geologic character of rock materials. The Low estimation shows the youthful phases of the life cycle of the tributaries in the pappiredipatti watershed. Elongation proportion is impacted by the length and recurrence of the streams, lithology of area, recharge structures, land use/land cover changes, climate condition, relief and aspect, and slope.|$|R

She {{instantly}} was conveyed away from him, and her cab joined the knotted stream of vehicles, each marked by a light, and <b>indistinguishable</b> one <b>from</b> the other. He stood watching for a moment, and then, as if swept by some fierce impulse, from the spot where they had stood, he turned, crossed the road at a rapid pace, and disappeared.|$|R
50|$|For example, Cryan's buckmoth (Hemileuca maia) feeds only on {{the herb}} Menyanthes trifoliata, {{commonly}} known as buckbean, and while <b>indistinguishable</b> morphologically <b>from</b> related buckmoths, and not differentiated at the genetic markers tested, the moth is highly adapted to its host plant, having 100% survivorship on Menyanthes, while close genetic relatives all died when reared on the plant. In this case gene flow was sufficient to reduce differentiation at neutral markers, but did not prevent local host adaptation.|$|R
