40|$|We {{investigated}} mechanisms {{involved in}} inhibition of maize (Zea mays L.) leaf-elongation growth following addition of non-penetrating osmolyte {{to the root}} medium. The elongation rate of the first true leaf remained inhibited for 4 h after addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG; - 0. 5 MPa water potential), despite progressive osmotic adjustment in the growing leaf tissues. Thus, inhibition of leaf growth {{did not appear to}} be directly related to loss of leaf capacity to maintain osmotic potential gradients. Comparative cell-wall-extension capacities of immature (still expanding) leaf tissues were measured by creep extensiometry using whole plants. Reductions in irreversible (plastic) extension capacity (i. e. wall hardening) were detected minutes and hours after addition of PEG to the roots, by both in vivo and in vitro assay. The onset of the wall-hardening response could be detected by in vitro assay only 2 min after addition of PEG. Thus, initiation of wall hardening appeared to precede transcription-regulated responses. The inhibition of both leaf growth and wall-extension capacity was reversed by removal of PEG after 4 h. Moreover, wall hardening could be induced by other osmolytes (mannitol, NaCl). Thus, the leaf responses {{did not appear to be}} related to any specific (toxic) effect of PEG. We conclude that hardening of leaf cell walls is a primary event in the chain of growth regulatory responses to PEG-induced water deficits in maize. The signaling processes by which PEG, which is not expected to penetrate root cell walls or membranes, might cause cell-wall hardening in relatively distant leaves was also investigated. Plants with live or <b>killed</b> <b>roots</b> were exposed to PEG. The <b>killed</b> <b>roots</b> were presumed to be unable to produce hormonal or electrical signals in response to addition of PEG; however, inhibition of leaf elongation and hardening of leaf cell walls were detected with both live and <b>killed</b> <b>roots.</b> Thus, neither hormonal signaling nor signaling via induced changes in surface electrical potential were necessary, and hydraulic signals appeared to generate the leaf responses...|$|R

50|$|Catechins {{released}} into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. Centaurea maculosa, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant's <b>root</b> to <b>kill</b> <b>root</b> cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where Centaurea maculosa is an invasive, uncontrolled weed.|$|R

50|$|Phalaenopsis bellina prefers bright, {{filtered}} light, warm temperatures, {{and good}} air circulation. It {{is essential that}} potting/mounting media approaches dryness between waterings to avoid root rot. Distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water is recommended if municipal water is hard or has a high TDS count, because salt buildup in the planting media can quickly desiccate and <b>kill</b> <b>roots.</b> Large plants grow quickly and should thus be fertilized regularly {{during the growing season}} to promote growth of new leaves, roots, and flowers. When plants have outgrown their pots or mounts, it is recommended to move them into the new substrate while new roots are growing so that the plant can acclimate to its new conditions. Since P. bellina is epiphytic, it prefers to have good air movement around its roots. This means using a loose, airy medium such as fir bark, tree fern fiber, synthetic media, and others.|$|R

2500|$|Foaly's {{investigation}} {{points to}} French personal investigator Luc Carrére. Holly leads a squad consisting of Root, Artemis and Butler, and herself above ground to France to interrogate Luc. Butler breaks into {{his apartment in}} Paris, but finds only a heavily mesmerized Luc, counterfeit Euros, and a fairy handgun. Butler neutralises Luc, ensures the Parisian knows nothing of the goblin use of batteries, and leaves the private eye to be arrested. Although Artemis is concerned by the ease of the operation, he puts aside his concerns to travel to Murmansk with Butler, Root and Holly to attempt a rescue for Artemis Fowl I. Cudgeon sees this as the perfect opportunity to <b>kill</b> <b>Root,</b> and sends a goblin [...] to ambush the party. The goblins nearly succeed in killing the four as all fairy weapons currently in use by the force have just been disabled by Koboi. The resulting attack leaves Butler unconscious and trapped under rubble from an overhang with Commander Root. Holly and Artemis use a nuclear train to free Root and Butler, but the group is then forced to perform an emergency healing when the train door cuts off Holly's trigger finger. Holly questions Artemis about his father and {{how he came to}} be so ruthless in the events of the previous book, and, in a rare moment of sincerity, Artemis admits he made a mistake, a sign of his moral development that continues through the series.|$|R

50|$|Formaldehyde is {{featured}} on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of the top 10 most hazardous chemicals for damaging the environment. It is carcinogenic in humans and animals because the cross-linking can cause DNA to keep cells from halting the replication process. This unwarranted replication of cells can lead to cancer. Unicellular organisms found in the soil and groundwater are also quite sensitive to cross-linking, experiencing damage at a concentration of 0.3 mg to 22 mg per liter. Formaldehyde also affects aquatic invertebrates, with crustaceans being the most sensitive type. The range of concentration damaging them is 0.4 mg to 20 mg per liter.

50|$|This disease infects {{any part}} of the plant below ground, so it often targets the roots; pegs or pods that are below ground are also vulnerable. Infected parts turn black and die. Often the {{infection}} spreads and <b>kills</b> the entire <b>root</b> system, effectively killing the plant. Originally the disease was localized to North Carolina and Virginia, but recently Florida and Georgia have begun experiencing higher incidences of the rot. Recent research has shown tebuconazole to significantly suppress the disease and increase yields by up to 1,500 pounds per acre.|$|R
30|$|Together, the {{two studies}} {{emphasize}} the importance of disturbance type (i.e. natural vs. anthropogenic) and severity on understory plant community composition in paludified forests. Restricting circulation of logging machinery to evenly-spaced trails, such as during careful logging around advanced growth, leaves the understory vegetation and soils intact between the trails, which may induce rapid proliferation of ericaceous species such as R. groenlandicum and K. angustifolia (Lorente et al. 2012). These species may compete directly with trees for nutrients, and indirectly by modifying humus quality and inducing allelopathic effects (Thiffault et al. 2013). In contrast, by disturbing the organic layer in which the roots of ericaceous shrub proliferate (Mallik 1993; Hébert and Thiffault 2011), clearcutting can limit shrub proliferation and their negative effect on tree growth. Similarly, high-severity soil burns may <b>kill</b> the <b>roots</b> of ericaceous shrubs, whereas low-severity soil burns have the potential to stimulate their vegetative reproduction through sprouting and rhizomes growth (Mallik 2003).|$|R
50|$|The Oregon {{eradication}} effort, {{which began}} {{near the town}} of Brookings in southwest Oregon in 2001, has adapted its management efforts over the years in response to new information about P. ramorum. For example, after inoculation trials of various tree species more clearly delineated which hosts are susceptible, the Oregon cooperators began leaving nonhost species such as Douglas fir and red alder on site. In another example, after finding that a small percentage of tanoak stumps that were resprouting on the host removal sites were infected with the pathogen—whether these infections were systemic or reached the sprouts from the surrounding environment is unknown—the cooperators began pretreating trees with very small, targeted amounts of herbicide to <b>kill</b> the <b>root</b> systems of infected tanoaks before cutting them down. The effort has been successful in that while it has not yet completely eradicated the pathogen from Oregon forests, the epidemic in Oregon has not taken the explosive course that it has in California forests.|$|R

50|$|Necrotic ring spot is {{a common}} disease of turf caused by soil borne fungi (Ophiosphaerella korrae) that mainly infects roots (4). It is an {{important}} disease as it destroys the appearance of turfgrasses on park, playing fields and golf courses. Necrotic Ring Spot {{is caused by a}} fungal pathogen that is an ascomycete that produces ascospores in an ascocarp (6). They survive over winter, or any unfavorable condition as sclerotia. Most infection occurs in spring and fall when the temperature is about 13 to 28°C (5). The primary hosts of this disease are cool-season grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass and annual bluegrass (6). Once turf is infected with O. korrae, it <b>kills</b> turf <b>roots</b> and crowns. Symptoms of the disease are quite noticeable since they appear as large yellow ring-shaped patches of dead turf. Management of the disease is often uneasy and requires application of multiple controls. The disease can be controlled by many different kind of controls including chemicals and cultural.|$|R
