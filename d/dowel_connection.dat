40|$|In {{order to}} be able to realistically and {{consistently}} elucidate and subsequently simulate the load–displacement behavior of single-dowel connections, the material behavior of the individual components, namely steel dowels and wood, needs to be investigated. The behavior of slotted-in, single-dowel steel-to-laminated veneer lumber (LVL) <b>connections</b> with <b>dowel</b> diameters of 12 and 20 mm is thoroughly discussed here in relation to steel dowel and LVL properties. In addition to connection tests at different load-to-grain directions of 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, the corresponding embedment behavior of LVL was tested up to dowel displacements of three times the dowel diameter. The material behavior of steel dowels was studied by means of tensile and 3 -point bending tests and accompanying finite element simulations. A pronounced nonlinear behavior of the single-dowel connections was observed for all load-to-grain directions. In case of loading perpendicular to the grain, a significant hardening behavior was obvious. Due to the anisotropic material properties of wood, enforcing a loading direction of 45 ° to the grain resulted in an additional force perpendicular to the load direction which was quantified in a novel biaxial test setup. Thus, a comprehensive and consistent database over different scales of observations of <b>dowel</b> <b>connections</b> could be established, which subsequently was exploited by means of engineering modeling. The comparison of experimental and numerical data illustrates the potential of the engineering modeling approach to overcome drawbacks of current design regulations, which are unable to appropriately predict stiffness properties of <b>dowel</b> <b>connections.</b> Moreover, the quasi-elastic limit of <b>dowel</b> <b>connections</b> was calculated and discussed by means of the model...|$|R
40|$|Ductile {{behavior}} of timber connections with metal fasteners {{is essential to}} achieve a robust structure. Moreover, a ductile {{behavior of}} the fastener and the timber prior to failure is necessary to fulfill the boundary conditions for applying the Johansen theory (1949). If these boundary conditions are not fulfilled, the capacity of a connection is overestimated and brittle failure may occur. However, using sufficient spacing, end and edge distances reduces tensile stresses perpendicular to the grain, the main stresses initiating brittle failure. If {{in addition to that}} the influence of the relation between fastener diameter and timber volume is considered, brittle failure mechanisms can be avoided. This paper discusses quasi static tests carried out on <b>dowelled</b> <b>connections</b> with different spacing and loaded end distances chosen in accordance to the above criterion. The results were compared with the capacity calculation for <b>dowelled</b> <b>connections</b> of Eurocode 5, chapter 8. 2, the design approach against block shear failure of Eurocode 5, Annex A, and the design proposal for the avoidance of block shear failure proposed by Hanhijärvi and Kevarinmäki (2008).

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} the knowledge on the seismic behavior of dowel beam-to-column connections, typically employed in precast buildings in Europe. Despite the large diffusion {{of the industrial}} buildings, a high seismic vulnerability was exhibited by these structures, mostly due to the connection systems deficiencies, during some recent earthquakes (Emilia 2012, Turkey 2011). An experimental campaign was conducted on a typical <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> between an external column and a roof beam. In this paper, the performed cyclic shear test is described. According to the experimental results, the seismic response {{of the system is}} evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness and failure mechanism. Moreover, the complete damage pattern of the test is described by means of the instrumentations records. The connection failure occurred due to the concrete cover failure in the column (splitting failure). Such a mechanism corresponds to a negligible energy dissipation capacity of the connection, compared to the overall seismic response of the structure. The experimental results are also compared with the results of a similar monotonic shear test, as well as with some literature relationships for predicting the strength of dowel connections under horizontal (seismic) loads...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) {{consist of}} a steel tube with {{concrete}} infill. CFST columns offer an effcient and economical alternative to conventional reinforced concrete bridge columns, in that CFST columns can offer larger strength and stiffness and facilitate rapid construction. The first phase of this research project uses numerical and experimental methods to develop design procedures for various CFST column-to-cap beam connections. Three connections were studied, namely: (1) an embedded ange connection in which the CFST {{is embedded in the}} cap beam, (2) a welded <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> in which a series of headed dowels is welded inside the tube and embedded into the cap beam (both fully bonded and partially deboned conditions were studied), and (3) a <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> in which an independent cage of headed dowels and transverse reinforcing is developed into the CFST and embedded into the cap beam. All specimens were constructed using precast cap-beam components to demonstrate the feasibility of using these connections for accelerated bridge construction (ABC). The experimental program included specimens that simulated either the transverse or longitudinal direction of the bridge. Results showed that the three connection types provide excellent ductility under reversed-cyclic loading while all super-structure elements remained essentially elastic. The document provides design expressions, design examples and proposed codified language to facilitate immediate implementation of the research results into practice. In the second phase, performance based earthquake engineering (PBEE) tools were used to evaluate and compare the response of a reinforced concrete (RC) bridge with a CFST bridge designed using the design expressions developed in phase 1. The PBEE tool set included fragility functions that express the likelihood of damage and reparability, nonlinear analysis methods that capture the full cyclic response of the structural system, and incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) to evaluate collapse potential. The analysis process was as follows: (1) the selected bridge was designed using RC and CFST components, with the objective of having the same strength and stiffness, (2) the structures were subjected to a suite of ground motions scaled to represent servicability (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design (7 % probability of exceedance in 75 years), and maximum considered (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) seismic hazard levels, (3) fragility curves were used to compare the performance of the bridge including damage state as well as maximum and residual drift, and (4) IDAs were conducted to compare the collapse probability.

40|$|The grouted <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> is {{a simple}} and {{cost-effective}} connection used in many precast concrete structural systems. The required dowel length is currently designed as a regular bar in reinforced concrete, which underestimates the bond strength, thus resulting in excessive connection lengths. Furthermore, precast wall construction continues throughout cold weather, where in-situ heating of the grout used in the grouted dowel connections is usually conducted for short periods of time. Hence, early-age exposure to subfreezing conditions may {{affect the quality of}} the grout and subsequently the bond strength of the connection, which can compromise structural integrity. In this thesis, full-scale pullout tests were performed and their results were compared with relevant data in the open literature in order to develop a reliable design equation for predicting the required dowel development length. The equation was found to produce results three times smaller than that determined by the ACI 318 - 14 code, while being desirably 10 % more conservative than equations proposed in previous research. The effect of subfreezing exposure on the bond strength of the connection, along with the mechanical properties, hydration process and pore size distribution of the grout were also examined. Grout specimens were initially cured at ambient temperature (23 ± 1 °C) for one day and then placed inside an environmental chamber at - 10 °C. The compressive strength of the grout was monitored at additional temperatures of 1 °C and - 20 °C. It was found that early-age subfreezing curing temperatures reduced the compressive strength of the grout, leading to increased dowel embedment length to achieve bar fracture. The bond strength of the connection remained proportional to the square root of compressive strength, even when subsequent to early-age subfreezing exposure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{good design}} of <b>dowel</b> type {{fastener}} <b>connections</b> {{is essential to}} ensure safe designs for the whole structure and cost effective solutions. With reinforced connections, engineers can achieve better capacity of the connection and safer designs by increasing the ductility of the connection (so-called ``capacity design'' with a ductile connection to be the weak point). This paper presents {{an overview of the}} reinforcement of <b>dowel</b> type <b>connections.</b> Most of the failures encountered in <b>dowel</b> type <b>connections</b> occur because of an excess of shear stresses or tensile stresses perpendicular to the grain in the connection area. Because of the large amount of situations and reinforcement techniques, this report mainly focuses on the reinforcement of dowel-type <b>connections</b> when the <b>dowels</b> are mainly loaded parallel to the grain. For such connections, modes of failure of un-reinforced and reinforced connections, updated design models and the effect of the reinforcement on the ductility of the connection will be presented.

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{panels are}} a popular construction technique {{due to their}} increased construction speed, low cost {{and the ability to}} use the precast concrete elements for structural walls to provide high strength and stiffness when used for structural purposes. Slender precast concrete wall panels are a common construction method for single storey warehouse type buildings. Following the Canterbury earthquake sequence Christchurch from 2010 – 2014, damage was observed in precast concrete wall buildings that resulted in out-of-plane collapse of wall panels.. This project seeks to investigate the behaviour of precast reinforced concrete walls designed for limited ductility under gravity and quasi-static in-plane loading. The main point of interest in this thesis research is to understand the seismic behaviour of the connection as well as the out-of-plane stability of slender panels. To investigate the behaviour of this panel and connection type, three slender precast concrete walls, representing full scale panel geometry were subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. Two common panel to foundation connection types were studied: 1) threaded inserts and 2) traditional starter bars as well as one alternative connection which was developed as a means to improve the out-of-plane response and understand the impact of this design choice on the in-plane behavior of the wall. For all the three units, the <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> performed well and the thin wall failed under flexural failure due to loss of strength cause by fracturing of longitudinal rebars after being buckled under the effects of lateral cyclic loading. Significant horizontal cracking occurred on each of the tests at dowel level except unit threaded insert with 50 mm cover behind the head of the insert (TI 12 -C 50 -IP) which suffered a secondary horizontal crack at 500 mm above the main crack and a diagonal crack {{at the center of the}} wall. Moreover, this unit was able to undergo more deformation due to a secondary crack...|$|E
40|$|The {{inadequacy}} of beam -to-column connections in RC precast structures can cause catastrophic collapses due, for instance, to loss of s upport phenomena {{in the case}} of absence of mechanical devices. In order to achieve an adequate global seismic capacity, hence, the retrofitting of these connections is a necessary step for existing precast structures. An experimental campaign is performed in order to investigate the seismic behavior of typical beam -to-column connections for precast one- story buildings. The reference connection is a dowel beam -to-column connection, tested under cyclic shear loads up to collapse. It showed a very brittle fai lure with concrete cover splitting in the column and a non- symmetric behavior for the two loading directions. In particular, for pulling loads (i. e. horizontal loads against the column frontal cover) a significant strength degradation occurs after the attainment of the maximum shear strength, corresponding to the occurrence of the first crack in the column concrete cover. After the cyclic shear test, the described beam -to-column connection was retrofitted. The proposed retrofitting solution is based on two main mechanical principles: the three hinged arch and the dowel effect so that the total seismic force applied to the beam is transferred to the other two hinges on the column by two steel profiles. The cyclic global behavior in terms of force -displacement curve was investigated and the damage patterns after the test were described by means of both visual inspections and instrumentation records. The experimental results demonstrate a good behavior under seismic actions, since no significant damage in the concrete was recorded due to the large concrete covers in the retrofitted system which prevented brittle failures in the connected elements. The horizontal shear force was mostly sustained by the three hinges mechanism, ensured by the two steel profiles unde r axial loads. Moreover, the comparison between the retrofitted and the dowel beam -to-column connection also allow to define the main critical features of this connection system, as the concrete cover of steel bars in the connected structural elements. T he retrofitted connections showed larger shear strength as well as larger dissipated energy values than the standard <b>dowel</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|E
40|$|Timber {{platform}} frame {{has evolved}} as an efficient method of construction for domestic dwellings and is experiencing continual {{growth in the}} UK due to it lending itself to off-site modem methods of construction (MMC), being environmentally efficient and exhibiting structural robustness. The challenge faced by the industry in the UK is to continue the evolutionary process such that the future demands of off-site MMC and regulatory changes are met. By conducting {{a study of the}} development of timber platform frame construction and reviewing the current and future requirements of the domestic dwelling construction market the challenges for the industry were highlighted. The business drivers of a timber platform frame manufacturer were considered and in conjunction with the information from the review an agenda of research programmes was derived. The objective of the research, although primarily from a structural timber engineering perspective, was to address the challenges faced by the industry employing a holistic approach with a view to implementing applied research. The UK procurement process for domestic dwelling construction is such that building layout is determined by architectural requirements. Building layout can have an adverse effect on structural stability and result in an inefficient system. A design review was conducted to determine the influencing factors which impinge upon system stability as a result of which recommendations for improvements were made. From the investigation the transfer of shear from a wall diaphragm to the foundation was deemed critical. Therefore, an experimental study was carried out which has resulted in an optimised specification. Further to this mathematical modelling techniques were used to demonstrate the impact that architectural layout has on stability, quantifying the financial penalty of inefficient layout and making recommendations to improve current designs. One of major priorities of the UK Government is to reduce climate change by implementing a low carbon economy with sustainable production and consumption; all with duty of care towards natural resources. Improvements to the Building Regulations (2006), in conjunction with other requirements, will result in wall U-values in domestic dwellings to be between 0. 27 to 0. 30 W/m 2 K. To determine an efficient method of meeting the new regulations an all encompassing research programme was conducted with the primary function being to develop a sustainable method of achieving thermal efficiency. Another method of wall construction is Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) and this option was reviewed. Initial work by Kermani (2005) on the structural performance of SIPs was extended to examine their racking characterisitcs with comparative studies to European and British structural codes of practice carried out. One of the key industry drivers which the review highlighted was the need for the implementation of lean technologies. The fabrication of flitch beams (timber-steel-timber sandwich configuration), used in cases of onerous load span conditions and limited depth of section, was improved through the implementation of a shot fired <b>dowel</b> <b>connection</b> method. To optimise the method of fabrication and achieve implementation an extensive laboratory study was carried out the results of which are compared to European structural codes of practice with recommendations made for design. The implementation of off-site MMC methods results in a change in associated risk during construction from minor consequence and high risk to major consequence and low risk. The crane erect method of timber platform frame construction optimises on-site performance in terms of both time and cost and reduces the requirement of working at height, which on average causes almost one fatality every week. The biggest health and safety risk associated with the crane erect method is failure of the roof system when being lifted into position. Using an analytical model, verified by full scale laboratory testing, a range of lifting conditions were researched and a best practice lifting procedure was developed which allows the safe lifting of standard roof systems used in domestic dwelling construction.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} results of an extensive experimental and analytical investigation into the effect of connections on the seismic response of precast concrete buildings, which was performed {{within the framework of the}} two European projects: SAFECAST and SAFECLADDING. The investigation was concerned with two important groups of connections, i. e. those between columns and beams, and those between the cladding panels and the main structure. Cyclic tests were first performed on specimens from both groups of connections, after which the failure mechanisms, based on the obtained experimental results, and making use of detailed 3 D numerical analyses, were explained. A number of robust engineering models were developed, which take into account some of the key characteristics of the cyclic response of connections of the investigated types. In the case of <b>dowel</b> <b>connections,</b> the effect, on the load-carrying capacity of the connection, of stirrups, as well as of the large relative rotations between columns and beams, was investigated. This represents one of the main contributions of the dissertation. In order to evaluate the effect of connections on the seismic response of whole buildings, an extensive parametric study was then performed, which examined the fragility and seismic risk of typical singlestorey and three-storey precast buildings located in Ljubljana. It was found that if the load-carrying capacity of the <b>dowel</b> <b>connections</b> was inaccurately assessed, then the safety of such structures could be seriously affected, since the ability of connections of this type to dissipate seismic energy by means of plastic deformation is relatively low.

Hereby the influence of different parameters is studied such as the geometry (bond-line length and thickness) and the material properties (e. g. adhesives of highly diverse stiffness). Additionally, reference tests on a dowel-type connection are made. The purpose is to see the differences between <b>dowelled</b> and glued <b>connections</b> and {{to see if there are}} some advantages in using glued timber connections (the base geometry was chosen acc. to Eurocode 5).

It was found that glued connections with the adhesives SikaPower- 4720 and SikaFast- 5215 NT (an epoxy and an acrylate, respectively) had higher stiffness than the <b>dowel</b> <b>connections,</b> whereas connections with the silicone adhesive SikaSil SG- 500 had a lower stiffness.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development and}} validation of Finite Element Methods (FEM) to simulate the dynamic response of a dowelled-joist timber floor. This is a solid floor comprised of timber joists connected using timber dowels with individual assemblies connected using inclined metal screws. The {{focus is on the}} structural dynamics in the low-frequency range up to 200 Hz which is the relevant range for impact sound insulation and vibration serviceability. <b>Dowel</b> <b>connections</b> between the joists that formed each assembly were modelled using either rigid or spring connectors in the FEM models. The validation against experimental modal analysis showed that both approaches were valid in terms of the eigenfrequencies, Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) and the spatial-average velocity with point excitation. Whilst the FEM model with spring connectors had a higher number of correlated modes in the MAC analysis, this required removal of many spurious modes before predicting the response. The validated models were used to demonstrate the potential in predicting assessment parameters for vibration serviceability that are contained in EN 1995 - 1 - 1 (Eurocode 5).

40|$|In timber structures, the {{connections}} are generally flexible {{in comparison to}} the members they connect, and so contribute significantly to the dynamic properties of the structure. It is shown here that a widely-used form of connection, the dowel-type connection, exhibits nonlinear stiffness and energy dissipation, even at pre-yield loads, and that this nonlinearity affects the modal properties of structures with such connections. This study investigates that behaviour by modal analysis of a portal frame and a cantilever beam constructed from timber with steel <b>dowel</b> <b>connections.</b> The observed nonlinearity is explained qualitatively by considering the measured force–displacement response of individual connectors under cyclic load, which show a reduction in stiffness and an increase in energy dissipation with increasing amplitude of vibration. The structures were tested by modal analysis under slow sine sweep and pseudo-random excitation. Under pseudo-random excitation, a linear single degree-of-freedom curve fit was applied to estimate the equivalent linear modal properties for a given amplitude of applied force. Under slow sine sweep excitation, the frequency response function for the structures was observed to show features similar to a system with a cubic component of stiffness, and the modal properties of the structures were extracted using the equation of motion of such a system. The consequences for structural design and testing are that two key design parameters, natural frequency and damping, vary depending on the magnitude of vibration, and that parameters measured during in-situ testing of structures may be inaccurate for substantially different loads...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dowel</b> type <b>connections</b> such as bolts {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{specified}} mechanical fasteners used in wood frame construction in North America. Current design practice for bolted timber joints is based on the yielding of the bolt or wood rather than the fracture potential of splitting or shear failure in wood. This decision to not formally recognize the influence of fracture within the connection design process could be a critical oversight. Yield-based design of bolted joints can be misleading, especially when multiple bolted connections are considered. This issue becomes even more complex when Engineered Wood Products (EWPs) are introduced as members in the joint systems. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStructural {{sections}} of laminated bamboo can be connected using methods common in timber engineering, however the different material properties of timber and laminated bamboo {{suggest that the}} behaviour of connections in the two materials {{would not be the}} same. This study investigates the <b>dowelled</b> <b>connection,</b> in which a connector is passed {{through a hole in the}} material, and load is resisted by shear in the connector and embedment into the surrounding material. Steel dowels were used in a connection between a laminated bamboo member and a steel plate in a central slot in the bamboo, and the behaviour of this connection was compared with a similar connection in timber. The laminated bamboo was made from Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) which had been treated by one of two preservative processes, either bleaching or caramelisation. Following testing, substantial qualitative differences between the bamboo and timber specimens were observed: the bamboo failed most often by the formation of a shear plug whereas the timber failed by a single split. The two preservative treatments resulted in different behaviour: the bleached bamboo had a degree of ductility roughly twice that of the caramelised bamboo. Digital image correlation provided full-field strain measurements, which gave further insight into the differences between the materials, particularly between bamboo and timber. Shear strain is dominant in the bamboo, compared with tensile strain perpendicular to grain in the timber. Numerical modelling showed that this difference in the strain field could be explained by the different orthotropic elastic and frictional properties of the two materials...|$|R
40|$|The author proposes several {{structural}} solutions {{aimed at}} the reinforcement of monolithic floor slabs by means of fastening metal stripes {{onto the surface of}} slabs, laying supplementary reinforcement rods inside indents and attaching them by dowels. The author describes a force redistribution pattern identified in the course of analysis of monolithic floor slabs of buildings that have a wall design system. The author provides recommendations concerning the method of trial loading designated for the assessment of the true bearing capacity of floor slabs of residential buildings. The monolithic nature of reinforced slabs is attained by supplementary <b>dowel</b> <b>connections.</b> The <b>dowel</b> joint of old and new concrete elements takes the transverse shearing force in the event of bending to assure the monolithic behaviour of elements. Efficient behaviour of a monolithic slab is attained by means of a reliable connection between supplementary reinforcement rods and reinforcement rods inside slabs. Elements made of composite materials have been recently applied to strengthen reinforced concrete structures. These materials are basically composed of polymer tars and reinforcement materials (glass fiber, carbon and aramid fibers). Polymer sheets, stripes and fabric replace metal sheets, stripes and reinforcing meshes.

30|$|In {{the last}} decade, some 2 D finite element (FE) {{models have been}} {{proposed}} [8 – 10]. These models can be efficient to simulate the embedding behavior with thin wood members (such as the American test). However, they are limited with long fasteners such as dowel-type connections with thick timber members and slender dowels, which are three-dimensional problems (non-uniform stress distributions across the thickness of members). Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop a 3 D FE model to simulate the embedding behavior of timber with dowel-type fastener, in particular, for multi-fastener joints with thick timber members and slender dowels. The 3 D FE models have the ability to predict the load carrying capacity of <b>dowel</b> timber <b>connections</b> as well as the 3 D stress field.|$|R
40|$|Load-duration {{behavior}} of steel <b>doweled</b> wood <b>connections,</b> such as bolted and nailed connections, {{has been studied}} to only a limited extent. The assumption in design is that the load-duration {{behavior of}} connections {{is identical to the}} load-duration behavior of wood members in flexure. Load-duration tests on small specimens are underway to examine the adequacy of existing time effect factors. A total of 160 specimens are being tested under long term load. The data available to date was fitted to the exponential damage rate model and a preliminary time effect factor of 0. 73 was determined for occupancy live load. This value is somewhat lower than the existing value of 0. 8. Judgements about the implications of this difference must be saved until more data is available...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{load-carrying}} capacity calculation of laterally loaded metal <b>dowel</b> type <b>connections</b> according to Eurocode 5. It is based on analytically derived, relatively complicated mathematical relationships, and thus it can be quite laborious for practical use. The aim is to propose a possible simplification of the calculation. Due to quite a great variability of fasteners’ types and the connection arrangements, the {{attention is paid to}} the most commonly used nailed connections. There was performed quite an extensive parametric study focused on the calculation of load-carrying capacity of the simple shear and double shear plane nail connections, joining two or three timber parts of softwood or hardwood. Based on the study results, in conclusion there are presented simplifying recommendations for practical design...|$|R
