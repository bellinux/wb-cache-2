5|$|Once Italy {{entered the}} war, Emanuele Filiberto {{was used as}} a harbor defense ship in Venice to protect the port from Austrian naval attacks. She was aided <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task</b> by her sister and the old {{battleship}} , along with two cruisers and several smaller craft. The ship remained in the Italian Navy's inventory for only a short time {{after the end of the}} war in 1918, and she was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

Since its arrival in the zone {{the division}} had been assisted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task</b> by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.|$|E

5|$|Circumstances became {{unfavorable}} in Dvin when Turkish generals {{seized the}} town from its Kurdish prince. Shadhi left {{with his two}} sons Ayyub and Asad ad-Din Shirkuh. His friend Mujahid ad-Din Bihruz—the military governor of northern Mesopotamia under the Seljuks—welcomed him and appointed him governor of Tikrit. After Shadhi's death, Ayyub succeeded him in governance of the city {{with the assistance of}} his brother Shirkuh. Together they managed the affairs of the city well, gaining them popularity from the local inhabitants. In the meantime, Imad ad-Din Zangi, the ruler of Mosul, was defeated by the Abbasids under Caliph al-Mustarshid and Bihruz. In his bid to escape the battlefield to Mosul via Tikrit, Zangi took shelter with Ayyub and sought his assistance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task.</b> Ayyub complied and provided Zangi and his companions boats to cross the Tigris River and safely reach Mosul.|$|E

There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, was the better option to help <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task.</b> While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in La Democracia. He subsequently noticed that his travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as Muñocistas and Barbosistas.|$|E
5|$|Lepanto {{was removed}} from front-line service in 1902 and {{converted}} into a gunnery training ship; to aid <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task,</b> the ship received a variety of light weapons that trainees {{would go on to}} use in the fleet. Italia was modernized in 190508, losing two of her funnels and several of her small-caliber guns; from 1909 to 1910, she served as a torpedo training ship. Both ships were reactivated in September 1911 after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, initially assigned to the 5th Division. After the capture of Tripoli in October, Italia and Lepanto were sent to the city to provide gunfire support for the soldiers defending it. Lepanto was stricken from the naval register on 26 May 1912, before the war ended, but she was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as an auxiliary. She did not remain in service long, being stricken again on 27 March 1915 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official papers to and from her government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task</b> by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder sister, would normally have been selected to assist, her inability to go long without crying was held against her.|$|E

5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>task</b> for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
