50|$|Sonic <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{the study}} and {{exploitation}} of sound {{as one of the}} principal channels conveying information, meaning, and aesthetic/emotional qualities in interactive contexts. Sonic <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing. If <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> about designing objects people interact with, and such interactions are facilitated by computational means, in sonic interaction design, sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an input medium.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the two-day}} conference Innovation Forum <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> <b>was</b> to focus on all aspects of {{interface}} and interaction design: mobile telephine amb media interfaces, problem solutions and product visions, web pages and virtual worlds, art and commerce, business and science. Using both concrete projects and visionary concepts, current developments in <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>were</b> presented and discussed by regional and international experts from the design, research and business worlds...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{dimensions}} of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>were</b> introduced in Moggridge's book <b>Designing</b> <b>Interactions.</b> Crampton Smith wrote that <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> draws on four existing design languages, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D. Silver later proposed a fifth dimension, behaviour.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Now that {{individual}} patterns for <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> {{have started to}} appear, the issue of structuring collections of patterns into Pattern Languages becomes relevant, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. In this paper, we investigate how Pattern Languages in <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> can <b>be</b> structured in a meaningful and practical way. A top-down approach is taken where patterns for <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> <b>are</b> organized hierarchically, from high-level design problems to low-level design problems. In addition, the usefulness of additional views and classifications for practical use are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Interaction design, often {{abbreviated}} as IxD, is [...] "the {{practice of}} designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services." [...] While the digital {{side of this}} statement is true, <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include design, human-computer interaction, and software development. While interaction design {{has an interest in}} form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior. Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> what clearly marks IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile <b>{{interaction}}</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> part of {{the interaction}} design which heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires {{of the majority of}} people who will use the product. The processes in mobile interaction design are in the following main types of activity: ...|$|E
50|$|Like user {{interface}} design and experience design, <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{often associated with}} the design of system interfaces {{in a variety of}} media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time, with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user's experience and not the other way around.|$|E
5000|$|Interactive {{communication}} {{is a modern}} term that encompasses these evolving forms of conversation. It is a primary characteristic of the present Information Age. New experiments in <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> evolving on a daily basis.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of human-computer interaction, the Natural Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules Language (NGOMSL) model {{is one of the}} most popular methods for {{modelling}} knowledge and cognitive processes for rapid usability evaluation. The NGOMSL model is a description of the knowledge that a user must possess to operate the system represented as elementary actions for effective usability evaluations. In the last few years, mobile robots have been exhibiting a stronger presence in commercial markets and very little work has been done with NGOMSL modelling for usability evaluations in the human-robot interaction discipline. This paper focuses on extending the NGOMSL model for usability evaluation of human-humanoid robot interaction in the soccer robotics domain. The NGOMSL modelled human-humanoid <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> of Robo-Erectus Junior was evaluated and the results of the experiments showed that the <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> able to find faults in an average time of 23. 84 s. Also, the <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> able to detect the fault within the 60 s in 100 % of the cases. The Evaluated <b>Interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> adopted by our Robo-Erectus Junior version of humanoid robots in the RoboCup 2007 humanoid soccer league...|$|R
50|$|Applying {{a pattern}} {{language}} approach to <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> first suggested in Norman and Draper's book User Centered System Design (1986). The Apple Computer's Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines also quotes Christopher Alexander's works in its recommended reading.|$|R
50|$|User {{expectations}} {{refers to}} the consistency that users expect from products. <b>Interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> very concerned with this topic. For example, our user expectations for traffic behavior {{is one of the}} more consistent ones because it is governed by traffic laws that are enforced. Software, or even worse small consumer electronics, on the other hand, can have widely varying degrees of consistency.|$|E
5000|$|A {{good rule}} of thumb or design {{principle}} to use in <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> to follow the [...] "Principle of least astonishment". In the case of interactive software applications, for example, users form expectations based on their experience with similar kinds of software. Effective software design aims to conform with prevailing norms for aspects of behavior such as the software's user interface and its responsiveness.|$|E
5000|$|Product {{design in}} the context of sonic <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> dealing with methods and {{experiences}} for designing interactive products having a salient sonic behaviour. Products, in this context, are either tangible and functional objects that are designed to be manipulated, or usable simulations of such objects as in virtual prototyping. Research and development in this area relies on studies from other disciplines, such as: ...|$|E
5000|$|User {{interface}} concepts {{were first}} mapped out by Pentagram {{working closely with}} litl. [...] Personas and detailed <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> <b>were</b> by Cooper Consulting in consultation with litl's internal design team. Fort Franklin also contributed to some design elements.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> Patterns <b>are</b> {{approached}} as {{an instrument}} to support the mapping of generic user tasks and user requirements with proven <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> solutions. Generic user tasks and user requirements need to be valid across different applications within a specified context of use. User tasks and user requirements <b>are</b> integrated into <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> patterns. Using an example from interactive television applications an user task and user requirement based <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> pattern <b>is</b> presented...|$|R
5000|$|In {{some cases}} Interactive <b>Design</b> <b>is</b> equated to <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design,</b> however in the {{specialized}} study of Interactive <b>Design</b> there <b>are</b> defined differences.To assist in this distinction, <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> can <b>be</b> thought of as: ...|$|R
50|$|While both {{definitions}} {{indicate a}} strong {{focus on the}} user, the difference arises from the purposes of Interactive Design and Interaction Design. In essence Interactive Design involves the creation of meaningful uses of hardware and systems and that <b>Interaction</b> <b>Design</b> <b>is</b> the design of those hardware and systems. Interaction Design without Interactive Design provides only hardware or an interface. Interactive Design without Interaction Design cannot exist for there is no platform {{for it to be}} used by the user.|$|E
50|$|IDEF8, or {{integrated}} {{definition for}} human-system <b>interaction</b> <b>design,</b> <b>is</b> {{a method for}} producing high-quality designs of interactions between users and the systems they operate. Systems are characterized {{as a collection of}} objects that perform functions to accomplish a particular goal. The system with which the user interacts can be any system, not necessarily a computer program. Human-system interactions are designed at three levels of specification within the IDEF8 method. The first level defines the philosophy of system operation and produces a set of models and textual descriptions of overall system processes. The second level of design specifies role-centered scenarios of system use. The third level of IDEF8 design is for human-system design detailing. At this level of design, IDEF8 provides a library of metaphors to help users and designers specify the desired behavior in terms of other objects whose behavior is more familiar. Metaphors provide a model of abstract concepts in terms of familiar, concrete objects and experiences.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{a theory}} {{for the field}} of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> based on philosophical pragmatism. The theory frames <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> as a pragmatic experience shaped by the inquiries of designers. The contributions of the theory are that it positions the designer at the centre of a theory, describes <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> practice to <b>be</b> more than a collection of methods and strategies, and provides a sound basis for generating and verifying new knowledge through design. The thesis describes and analyzes two <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> research projects through self-reflexive accounts that illustrate the proposed theory. The projects are a tangible museum guide and a responsive environment for physical play. The thesis examines the value of understanding <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> through pragmatism and how <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> when viewed as experience opens the field up to a new theoretical framework. The two <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> research projects arc described as design inquiries constituted by a design inquirer, designer intentions, and design rationales. Further descriptions of the projects show <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> to <b>be</b> comprised of <b>design</b> actions based on judgment and interpretation. <b>Interaction</b> <b>design</b> can <b>be</b> assessed by {{the degree to which}} there is integrity between the design inquiry and design actions, {{as well as by the}} transferability and discursiveness of the design inquiry findings that are relevant to the wider field of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> and related disciplines like human-computer interaction. The implications of the theory lead to new ways of mobilizing <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> research and <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> education. The pragmatic theory shows capacity for clear descriptions and analysis of <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> inquiries in ways that extract and communicate new knowledge from <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> practice and research. The theory shows <b>interaction</b> <b>design</b> to <b>be</b> a distinct and independent field of inquiry that generates knowledge through design.
