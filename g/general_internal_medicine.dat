25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{nephrology}} (or often renal medicine) is a subspecialty {{of general}} medicine. A nephrologist has completed medical school, foundation year posts (FY1 and FY2) and core medical training (CMT) {{and passed the}} Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) exam before competing for a National Training Number (NTN) in renal medicine. The typical subspecialty training is five years and leads to a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in both renal medicine and <b>general</b> (<b>internal)</b> <b>medicine.</b> Subspecialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees (MD/PhD).|$|E
25|$|Causes {{parallel}} the evolutionary changes {{occurring in the}} US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, {{most of which are}} handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening. Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> <b>medicine</b> career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.|$|E
