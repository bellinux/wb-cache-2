5000|$|André Desvallées had two {{influences}} in his career: Georges Henri Rivière and Hugues de Varine.

Rivière worked with Desvallées for many years, marking his influence also on the modus operandi of the MNATP's museum practices and, later, on his work with the <b>ecomuseums.</b> Varine, author of the term [...] "ecomuseum", influenced Desvallées to develop this concept, which broke with traditional patterns and directed the museological field to the [...] "New Museology" [...] movement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{representation}} of <b>Ecomuseums</b> with equipment 4. 0. <b>Ecomuseums</b> concern territories with traditional environmental characteristics enriched with natural heritage or historical architectural buildings involved in specific protection actions. The Lombard case {{is actually a}} vanguard within the national context {{with the establishment of}} 44 eco-museums from the Regional Law of 2007; this law defines the nature and establishes the recognition criteria of these entities. From those years <b>Ecomuseums</b> in Lombardy have gradually enriched the tools of {{representation of}} their peculiarities and their own rooms for the use. The attempt over the protection was making the equipment usable for creative processes of placemaking not yet implemented. The paper summarizes a research proposal that analyzes the possibility to use digital tools industry 4. 0 to represent and convey existence and use of these places and re-throw them in the exploitation network of national heritage using innovative methods currently belonging to the most advanced instrumentation industry. The purpose is analytical: on the one hand represent the diffuse objects in the territory with the latest technology, the other read its use by single users according to the type of read and write typical of the latest generation of industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ecomuseums</b> are {{innovative}} {{institutions in}} which new museological systems {{are used to}} conserve and interpret the tangible and intangible heritage of a defined geographical area and its corresponding community. <b>Ecomuseums</b> have {{a strong interest in}} public participation, in terms of both creation and subsequent development. Such institutions aim to establish an enduring dialogue between staff and community members and to influence positively the social and economic development of the locality. This research focuses on two <b>ecomuseums</b> in rural communities in Mexico. I analyse the impact of both museums on their communities in terms of social improvement within statutes of sustainability. I look at their value in enabling environmental and cultural conservation; and I examine the various communication processes linking outside “experts” and community members. The two museums tell markedly contrasting stories and show different processes of creation and community appropriation. The museum of San Juan Raya, located in a desert community in central Mexico, is a success story where an outside initiative was transformed into a beneficial community project largely run by local people. On the other hand the museum of Frontera Corozal, in the tropical jungle of southern Mexico, developed in a complex and fraught historic-political background, shows a much more problematic identity and no management continuity. My research draws the conclusion that, assuming appropriate communication processes are established, <b>ecomuseums</b> have the ability to help to empower rural communities, to promote social change, and to implement successful techniques of conservation and management of natural resources. Although these two museums are of interest in themselves, this research considers and finds meaning in their different trajectories. The results of this evaluation are relevant to other worldwide communities setting up equivalent institutions, and may facilitate the understanding and development of community museums.
