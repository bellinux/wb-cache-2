We also derive closed-form expressions for writer-extendible options and discuss the writer's economic incentives for extending an out-of-the-money option. We apply these results to show that corporate debtholders have a strong incentive to extend the maturity of defaulting debt if there are liquidation costs.

40|$|This paper {{tests and}} compares five {{distinct}} methods for estimating the term structure. The Unsmoothed Fama-Bliss method is an iterative {{method by which}} the discount rate function is built up by computing the forward rate necessary to price successively longer maturity bonds. The Smoothed Fama-Bliss "smooths out" these discount rates by fitting an approximating function to the "unsmoothed" rates. The McCulloch method fits a cubic spline to the discount function using an implicit smoothness penalty, while the Fisher-Nychka-Zervos method fits a cubic spline to the forward rate function and makes the smoothness penalty explicit. Lastly, the Extended Nelson-Siegel method, introduced in this paper, fits an exponential approximation of the discount rate function directly to bond prices.; The tests demonstrate the dangers of in-sample goodness-of-fit as the sole criterion for judging term structure estimation methods. A series of residual analysis tests are introduced to detect misspecification of the underlying pricing equation relating the term structure to bond prices. These tests establish the presence of unspecified, but nonetheless systematic, omitted factors in the prices of long <b>maturity</b> <b>notes</b> and bonds.; Comparisons of the five term structure estimation methods using these parametric and non-parametric tests finds that the Unsmoothed Fama-Bliss does best overall. Differences with some alternatives may not be economically significant given the much larger number of parameters this method estimates. Users seeking a parsimonious representation of the term structure should consider either the Smoothed Fama-Bliss or the Extended Nelson-Siegel methods. One method {{was found to be}} unacceptable. The Fisher-Nychka-Zervos cubic spline method performs poorly relative to the alternatives, both in- and out-of-sample.

We are working to develop heat tolerant baby and Fordhook type lima bean cultivars that are adapted to the Mid-Atlantic Region. Both field and greenhouse screening methods {{have been used to}} test inbred lines for heat stress response, but greenhouse screening has been particularly useful in determining the physiological effects of heat stress. METHODS Eight lima bean inbred lines were grown in two climate controlled chambers inside of the greenhouse under hot and cool night temperature regimes. Experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 5 replications. Target night temperatures were 27 °C in the hot chamber and 18 °C in the cool chamber. For experiment 1, target daytime temperatures were 32 - 35 °C in the hot chamber and 27 - 30 °C in the cool chamber. For experiment 2 target daytime temperatures for both chambers were 32 - 35 °C. Newly opened flowers were collected from plants grown under hot and cool night conditions. The style, with pollen adhering to it, was removed from the flower, stained with acetocarmine, then viewed and photographed under 40 x magnification.

The author shows that in 1975, Treasury officials financed an unusually rapid expansion of the federal deficit with a flurry of tactical offerings. Because the timing and maturities of the offerings followed no predictable pattern, the sales sometimes took investors by surprise, disrupting the market. These events led Treasury officials to embrace a more regularized program of regular and predictable issuance - a program they had been using for decades to auction bills.

Fifty leaves per plant were washed in distilled water, put in paper bags and oven dried at 60  °C for 48  h. Shoot height was measured from root collar to the apex at various DAS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study includes 100 normal singleton gestations between 10 to 40 weeks of gestation referred to our centre for routine antenatal ultrasound examination. All the women were evaluated by transabdominal ultrasonography. Foetal gestational age in weeks was determined by crown rump length, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femoral length. Placental thickness was measured in millimeters. All the placentae were graded using ultrasonographic grading system. RESULTS Our observations revealed that the placental thickness gradually increased from 11. 8 mm at 12 weeks to 38. 5 mm at 39 weeks. Placental thickness almost corresponds to advancing gestational age exhibiting a linear and direct growth. Progressive <b>maturity</b> changes were <b>noted</b> in placenta with advancing gestational age.
