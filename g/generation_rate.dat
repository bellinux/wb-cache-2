25|$|Goldsmith {{proposed}} {{that in addition}} to increasing the <b>generation</b> <b>rate,</b> and thereby evolution rate, a limited lifespan improves the evolution process by limiting the ability of older individuals to dominate the gene pool. Further, the evolution of characteristics such as intelligence and immunity may specially require a limited lifespan because otherwise acquired characteristics such as experience or exposure to pathogens would tend to override the selection of the beneficial inheritable characteristic. An older and more experienced, but less intelligent animal would have a fitness advantage over a younger, more intelligent animal except for the effects of ageing.|$|E

The major concern of the present paper is to explore the effects of Pr on the detailed information of local distributions of entropy {{generation in}} virtue of frictional and heat transfer irreversibility and the overall entropy generation in the whole flow field. The results of this work indicate that the significant viscous entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> (Su) gradually expand to bulk contributions of cavity {{with the increase of}} Pr, thermal entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> (Sθ) and total entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> (S) mainly concentrate in the steepest temperature gradient, the entropy generation in the flow is dominated by heat transfer irreversibility and for the same Rayleigh number, the amplitudes of Su, Sθ and S decrease with increasing Pr. It is found that that the amplitudes of the horizontally averaged viscous entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates,</b> thermal entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> and total entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> decrease with increasing Pr. The probability density functions of Su, Sθ and S also indicate that a much thinner tail while the tails for large entropy generation values seem to fit the log-normal curve well with increasing Pr.

25|$|Orders from {{countries}} fighting World War I required determining charges for different European military rifle cartridges, and production volume supported research for improvements. Improved military rifle propellants included a longitudinal perforation converting each grain to a tube with a progressive burning interior surface allowing a more consistent gas <b>generation</b> <b>rate</b> through the reaction period. Early propellants {{were identified by}} a two-digit number. As the number of experimental variations increased, each improved military rifle propellant was identified by a four-digit number. In addition to the canisters available from DuPont, the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) sold surplus improved military rifle propellants {{to members of the}} National Rifle Association. By 1936 improved DuPont process control produced batches conforming to published reloading data rather than requiring different charge specifications for each batch; and those propellants have remained in production. Non-conforming batches were used to load commercial and military cartridges following traditional testing procedures.|$|E

40|$|This work aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} study on the heat transfer and entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> of a horizontal channel partially filled with a porous medium which experiences internal heat generation or consumption due to exothermic or endothermic chemical reaction. The focus {{has been given to}} the local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model. The LTNE approach helps us to deliver more accurate data regarding temperature distribution within the system and accordingly to provide more accurate Nusselt number and entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates.</b> Darcy-Brinkman model is used for the momentum equations, and constant heat flux is assumed for boundary conditions for both upper and lower surfaces. Analytical solutions have been provided for both velocity and temperature fields. By incorporating the investigated velocity and temperature formulas into the provided fundamental equations for the entropy generation, both local and total entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> are plotted for a number of cases. Bifurcation phenomena regarding temperature distribution and interface heat flux ratio are observed. It has been found that the exothermicity or endothermicity characteristic of the channel does have a considerable impact on the temperature fields and entropy <b>generation</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|S>These {{programs}} are intended to:ssist in establishing reflector cooling requirements, {{as well as}} thermal stresses in the reflectors and pressure vessel. The main program (304 -Rec I) establishes required velocities between reflectors {{as a function of}} geometry, heat <b>generation</b> <b>rates,</b> material and fluid properties, and allowable surface temperature. This is done by iterating on velocities for successive water gaps. When required velocities have been established, corresponding thermal stresses are calculated. Rec II (301) and Prev I (301 A) are supplement programs. Rec II is utilized for establishing surface temperatures of a reflector as a function of velocities, geometry, heat <b>generation</b> <b>rates,</b> and matenial and fluid properties. It handles only one reflector per case. This program also calculates thermal stresses in the reflector. Prev I is intended for calculations concerning a pressure vessel, perfectly insulated at the outer surface. It calculates surface temperature and thermal stresses in the vessel as a function of velocity, geometry, heat <b>generation</b> <b>rates,</b> and matenial and fluid properties.

40|$|Measuring dust {{deposition}} and <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> {{is important}} for both its fundamental physics {{and the application of}} indoor air quality control. These measurements are very difficult to conduct directly in occupied livestock buildings. Two indirect methods were developed for the measurement of both deposition and <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> under steady-state conditions and unsteady-state conditions respectively. A new mathematical model of particle size distribution was also developed for swine building dust. Based on the mass balance equation for a typical well mixed ventilation space, the nonlinear mathematical solutions were derived. For steady-state conditions, a transformation was employed to the nonlinear solution so the linear model was obtained. Then the sequential parameter estimation method was developed to estimate both dust deposition and <b>generation</b> <b>rates.</b> The input data were airborne dust concentrations versus filtration efficiency. This steady-state method actually converted the difficult measurements of dust deposition and <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> into the simple measurements of dust concentrations versus filtration efficiency. For unsteady-state conditions, the nonlinear parameter estimation technique was employed to estimate the unknown parameters in the solution of the model. The input variable to this model was dust concentration versus time. The estimated unknowns were dust deposition and <b>generation</b> <b>rates.</b> This unsteady-state method actually converted the difficult measurements of dust deposition and <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> into the simple measurements of dust concentration versus time. For the validation of the steady-state method, two sets (six sub-sets) of steady-state condition experiments were conducted in the laboratory and the data were compared to computer simulations. Three experiments were conducted to validate the unsteady-state method. The proposed methods were also tested using data from Gao and Feddes (1992) for steady-state conditions, and from Wadden and Scheff (1983) for unsteady-state conditions, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The local heat {{generation}} {{in a single}} stack lithium ion battery cell was investigated {{as a function of}} the C-rate and state of charge (SoC). For that purpose, a custom build electrochemical cell design developed for local in-operando temperature measurements is used. The local temperature evolution in both electrodes and the separator is compared with local heat <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements. The impact of reversible and irreversible heats is evaluated {{as a function of the}} C-rate and the SoC.

Significant SoC dependencies of the local reversible and irreversible {{heat generation}} are reflected by both the local temperature measurements and the heat <b>generation</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from GITT.
