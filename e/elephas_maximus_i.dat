50|$|In the 19th century, a zoological {{exploration}} {{established that}} wild elephants occurred naturally in a restricted region of northeastern Borneo. The status and taxonomic distinctiveness of the Borneo elephants has been controversial since then. In 1940, Frederick Nutter Chasen considered Bornean elephants as descendants of an introduced stock, {{and placed them}} in the subspecies <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> indicus. Reginald Innes Pocock having studied specimens in the British Museum of Natural History disagreed in 1943, and placed all Sundaic elephants in the subspecies <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> sumatrensis. In 1950, Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described a subspecies <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in the National Geographical Magazine.|$|R

50|$|The Borneo elephant, {{also called}} the Borneo pygmy elephant, is a {{subspecies}} of Asian elephant that inhabits northeastern Borneo, in Indonesia and Malaysia. Its origin remains the subject of debate. A definitive subspecific classification as <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> borneensis awaits a detailed range-wide morphometric and genetic study. Since 1986, <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the population has declined by at least 50% {{over the last three}} generations, estimated to be 60-75 years.

5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an elephant from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the binomial <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian elephant under the binomial Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the binomial Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour {{and amount of}} depigmentation. The Sri Lankan elephant (<b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is native to mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is smaller {{than all the other}} subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial <b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|R
50|$|Several large Palearctic animals became extinct {{from the}} end of the Pleistocene into {{historic}} times, including the Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus), aurochs (Bos primigenius) woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), North African elephant (Loxodonta africana pharaoensis), Chinese elephant (<b>Elephas</b> <b>maximus</b> rubridens), cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), and European lion (Panthera leo europaea).|$|R
