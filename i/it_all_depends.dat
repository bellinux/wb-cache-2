[...] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J.

[...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation."

Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to keep us from complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, if you love the X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E

2500|$|Firstly, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> {{who has to}} pay for the cost, {{and what}} kind of {{sanctions}} there are for polluters. If the state pays the cost out of general taxes, the costs to individual private enterprises would be much lower compared to their gains. It may be that some businesses gain from an environmentally friendly policy, while others do not, so that they are in competition with each other. Mathematicians would point out that the costs of clean air and water are only a very small component of total capital costs, but some argue that corporations are profitable precisely because they do not pay for externalities. According to Leontief Prize winner Duncan K. Foley, the perception that curbing greenhouse gases is [...] "costly" [...] assumes that capitalism is [...] "efficient" [...] without such controls, but if externality costs exist, it means precisely that capitalism is not at all operating at its [...] "efficiency frontier".|$|E
2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> on the specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies. This [...] "indeterminacy" [...] criticism revolves around the idea that technological change could have many different and contradictory effects. It could reduce costs, or it could increase unemployment; it could be labor saving, {{or it could be}} capital saving. Therefore, so the argument goes, it is impossible to infer definitely a theoretical principle that a falling rate of profit must always and inevitably result from an increase in productivity. Perhaps the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall might be true in an abstract model, based on certain assumptions, but in reality no substantive empirical predictions can be made. In addition, profitability itself can be influenced by an enormous array of different factors, going far beyond those which Marx specified. So there are tendencies and counter-tendencies operating simultaneously, and no particular empirical result necessarily follows from them.|$|E
