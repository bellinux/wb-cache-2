40|$|The {{definition}} of a <b>finalized</b> <b>program</b> for the conversion of a degraded urban contest is a complex operation which must take in to account various aspects (technicalaesthetic, environmental, social, economic-financial and procedural); the feasibility of a salvaged operation is strictly dependant on financial and economic benefits originated by a reconversion program which made of sustainable and compatibility its referent assets. “Real “wealth can be made if the process of settled transformation born from program /project produces positive plusvalency and exteriority. The 61 area plan (PdZ) “Corviale” in Rome concerns an area of around 70 hectares, on which lies a town building of 960 meters built to host more than 6000 inhabitants, made of housing of public estate with an autonomous equipment of community services, expression of the modern theories on the housing unity and on the linear town, which is today the symbol of urban degradation which interests both the architectonic and social bounds. Today “Corviale” is no longer suitable to satisfy the settlement needs together with today life standards, therefore “Corviale” has to be reconsidered. The area on which lies, semi-central on the territory of Rome, is highly strategic under both the infrastructure and environmental profile and in theory it would present strong remarks in the market but inhibited by the lacks due to the physics conformation of the urban space and of the buildings. Giving back urban quality to “Corviale”, providing a partial introduction into the market of re-qualified estates (houses and services), it could create profits which make the operation sustainable from the financial and economic point of view. To reach the above is right {{to carry out a}} choice between two re-qualified hypothesis, one of demolition and the other one of recovery. We recognize technical problems for the demolition hypothesis, environmental and of costs tied to the materials selling off, therefore we intend to verify the feasibility of the intervention of re-conversion of the existent suggesting a settled model, which grants a recognition to the building connected to the integration between anthropic and natural sphere. The financial support must be fastened with the one environmental. The building can be transformed through the experimentation of new settled models and the use of technicalinstallation solutions which will allow of giving a new asset and of making autonomous at an energetic level the building solving the problems of an architectural and social character (ending bridges, inefficiency of installations), in the mixture of the new and old consumers to whom the building is addressed...|$|E

During the process of fleshing out the business plan and seeking venture capital, the goal changed from producing supercomputers to producing commercial implementations of, and development environments for, the recently <b>finalized</b> <b>programming</b> language Common Lisp, which Gabriel expected to become the standard AI language. Lucid's prospects were enhanced {{by the fact that}} five of the ten initial founders (Bill Scherlis, Scott Fahlman, Eric Benson, Rodney Brooks, and Gabriel) were on the committee that had written the Common Lisp standard; moreover, Gabriel was the initiator of the Common Lisp design effort, Fahlman was its de facto leader, and both Gabriel and Fahlman were part of the standard's five-person core group of authors (known as the Quinquevirate; these were Guy L. Steele Jr., Fahlman, David A. Moon, Daniel L. Weinreb, and Gabriel). The first CEO was Tony Slocum, formerly of IntelliCorp; and Gabriel was Lucid's Chief Technical Officer (CTO) and first president. The interpreter and the environment for Common Lisp they intended to market was not for the then-dominant Lisp machines, however. Regular workstations had become fast enough to reasonably run Lisp languages, and it was this, much larger market, that Lucid targeted.|$|R

50|$|However, object lifetimes are not {{necessarily}} bound to any scope, and objects may be destroyed non-deterministically or not at all. This {{makes it possible to}} accidentally leak resources that should have been released at the end of some scope. Objects stored in a static variable (notably a global variable) may not be <b>finalized</b> when the <b>program</b> terminates, so their resources are not released; CPython makes no guarantee of finalizing such objects, for instance. Further, objects with circular references will not be collected by a simple reference counter, and will live indeterminately long; even if collected (by more sophisticated garbage collection), destruction time and destruction order will be non-deterministic. In CPython there is a cycle detector which detects cycles and finalizes the objects in the cycle, though prior to CPython 3.4, cycles are not collected if any object in the cycle has a finalizer. Also, in the case of Python, the garbage collection strategy is an implementation detail, so running with an alternative interpreter (such as IronPython or Jython) could result in the RAII implementation not working.|$|R

GAO found that women were {{a majority of the}} clinical trial participants in the new drug applications (NDA) it examined and that every NDA included enough women in the pivotal studies to be able to statistically demonstrate that the drug is effective in women. Although these findings are welcome, GAO also found three areas of concern. The first is the relatively small proportion of women in early small-scale safety studies. These early studies provide important information on drugs' toxicity and safe dosing levels for later stages of clinical development, and many of the NDAs GAO examined found significant sex differences in a drug's pharmacokinetics, or how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted, and concentrated in the bloodstream. Second, GAO is not confident that either NDA sponsors or FDA's reviewers took full advantage of the available data {{to learn more about the}} effects of the drug in women and to explore potential sex differences in dosing. This is because NDA summary documents are not required to include analyses of sex differences, and many of them do not.

This is an important transitional year for the EUROGRAPHICS conference. For its 29 'th edition, the premium European event for Computer Graphics changed dates, moving from a cycle of submission in February and a conference in early September, to a cycle with submissions in late September and a conference in April. The first step of the full papers process was to put together our International Programme Committee (IPC) of 49 members, with the help of our two advisory board members, Fredo Durand and Eugene Fiume. After much preparation, we received 300 eligible full-paper submissions on September 26 th, 2007. During the paper sort we distributed the papers for review to the IPC members using the Graz Submission and Review Managment (SRM) System, with help from our advisory board. Each committee member had to review between 10 and 14 papers as primary or secondary reviewer. They also had to find 3 additional tertiary reviewers for each paper. All 300 submissions had at least 5 full reviews (with some getting up to 7 reviews), for a total of over 1550 reviews. The IPC met at the Hotel Novotel Arenas in Nice on Nov. 16 - 17 th, 2007. The paper submissions and their reviews were discussed extensively by IPC members, and great care was taken to treat all submissions equally and fairly. The IPC decided to accept 58 papers (of which some conditionally) to be presented at the conference, and an additional 20 were recommended for "fast resubmission" to the Computer Graphics Forum journal. These numbers show that the quality of the submissions was very high, and that the selection process imposed very high standards. After a short "second cycle" for the conditionally accepted papers, we <b>finalized</b> the <b>program</b> in early January 2008, with 58 full papers to be presented. The acceptance rate was thus 19. 3 %, maintaining the high competitive standards of the conference. We would like to thank {{some of the people who}} made this possible. First and foremost, all the members of the IPC who dedicated an enormous amount of their time to reviewing, finding tertiaries, coming to the meeting at their own expense and "sheparding" the conditionally accepted papers. All the tertiary reviewers, who also spent a significant amount of time providing high-quality and thoughtful reviews. All the authors of all submitted papers, to whom this entire process belongs. Catherine Martin of INRIA who organised all the administrative part of the IPC meeting and helped with the overall process, paying attention to every detail and ensuring that everything worked out well.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{signals the}} closure of IIASA's Radiation Safety of the Biosphere Program that started in 1995. The goal of the Program {{was to assess the}} world radiation legacy {{after the end of the}} Cold War. As such, it was a typical IIASA program: interdisciplinary, independent, and involving East-West collaboration. The Program aimed to investigate the accumulation over the past 50 years of vast quantities of radioactive waste and numerous radioactively contaminated sites resulting from the production and testing of nuclear weapons, as well as from nuclear accidents, in several countries, particularly Russia and the United States. While it was not possible for the Program to provide a complete inventory of all sites and remediation options, it did select the most significant examples. Studies of Russian sites, a comparison of these to similar sites in the United States, and ongoing studies in China helped to provide a greater perspective on the problem. The Program carried out one of the first unclassified studies of the local problems related to radioactive contamination in areas of the former Soviet Union. This led to the publication of the book "Radiation Legacy of the Soviet Nuclear Complex", which presented the first authoritative and detailed information available outside the former Soviet Union about the nuclear inheritance of the past half-century. The Radiation Safety of the Biosphere Program also attracted the attention of policy makers to the problem of the nuclear legacy in urban areas. The directorate of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow requested IIASA to start an international study to assess the radiological risk and resulting public impact from past waste management practices at the Institute. Responding to this request, the Radiation Program performed a scoping analysis of the environmental and social impacts of the radioactive waste disposal sites on the premises of the Kurchatov Institute which, because of the growth of the city of Moscow over the last 50 years, had actually become a part of downtown Moscow. This case study, which is reported in this Research Report, is an illustration of the general problem of the nuclear legacy in urban areas. With this report IIASA <b>finalizes</b> a successful <b>program,</b> which was not only an example of the Institutes collaborative work across the East-West political divide but also of IIASA's commitment to addressing issues of global change...|$|R
40|$|I. Project Title This {{proposal}} {{calls for}} an Urban Architecture Studio in London, UK. Preliminary programmatic elements include: studios, critic space, library, computer area, residence units, faculty suite, office(s),social lounge, porters’ lodge, dining room, kitchen, cook/maids room, and reception area. II. Statement of Intent As a current student {{with an interest in}} teaching later on in my career, I am naturally drawn to the design of an architecture facility and how it may facilitate the education that occurs within it. This notion was first presented to me by a representative of LeoA. Daly during a presentation regarding high performance K- 12 schools. Their stance was an energy efficient building would not only save money, but also foster a better learning environment. With an architecture school, this notion can be pushed further into more design aspects, not just day lighting. Rather than proposing an entire school, this proposal focuses on a smaller, yet equally intellectual stimulating project: a satellite school in London for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Architecture schools are extremely challenging, yet equally rewarding projects. The significance in designing an architecture school is that not only is there a general public perception of the building, but its main occupants are well-rounded architecture professors and students. The beauty of this is two-fold. On the one hand this potentially offers more valid criticism, yet on the other, more intriguing side, provides an important educational opportunity in design choices. The initial design intent of this project is to inspire both the architecture community and the everyday passerby alike. This is a topic often debated when asking “what constitutes good architecture?” Naturally, the goal becomes to create an architecture piece exciting and deep in meaning to a student, yet simple enough for person without a design background to understand. For example, a project on the recent cover of Architecture Record, may win approval from the profession, yet not from the occupants themselves. This is a tough topic to argue, but a good starting point is John Ruskin’s quote from The Seven Lamps of Architecture that “Good architecture must speak well, act well, and whatever it has to say or do it must look well. ” There are several design topics relevant to both my personal interests as well as the interests offered by my mentor Ted Ertl regarding this proposal. First, the project will incorporate an existing building and utilize adaptive re-use strategies. Due to the historical nature of London’s architecture and the possibility of incorporating it into the curriculum of the school, Professor Ertl’s knowledge in both adaptive re-use and historically preservation is advantageous to this project. He also has served as the London mentor, thus has first-hand knowledge of the cities’ urban conditions, as well as the needs of a study abroad academic program. Furthermore, since London’s laissez-faire approach to planning has warranted criticism on major architecture pieces, special attention will be given to urban conditions. Numerous prominent buildings in London’s Canary Wharf development produced grand pieces of architecture, yet lacked any connection to the human scale or relation to each other. Urban scale and context are important not only to serve as a learning prototype but may also help establish connections to the neighboring community. Since students are only visiting for a four month stay, a strong connection to the area can foster a better learning environment. Other personal interests include sustainability, studio culture, and dormitory living situations. As a motivated architect student set to enter the professional world, I feel an obligation not only to be educated in the field of sustainability, but also capable of applying it to a design project. So far in my education I have learned the principles of sustainable design, yet have not directly applied them to any studio project. This project provides the academic architecture community the opportunity to lead by example in the field of sustainability. Background research, mainly case studies and implementation sustainable principles, will be conducted this summer with the assistance of Professor Nathan Krug. A point of departure for the research is Thomas A. Fisher’s fiveprinciplesofsustainableenvironmentalarchitecture:HealthfulInterior Environment, Energy Efficiency, Ecologically Benign Materials, Environmental Form, and Good Design. Studio culture is also another area of interest. Having five plus years of countless hours of studio experience, one becomes aware of the both the highlights and downfalls of our own Architecture Hall. Not only are these issues to be explored, but other similar buildings will be analyzed, such as sustainable architecture facilities. Lastly, being a dorm resident of two years and living in a collegiate apartment complex for two more years, I am conscious of some of the successes and failures of the building types. Several issues must be considered when designing for young adult housing, verses typical residential units. These include, noise control, providing a community atmosphere, offering certain amenities, and catering to the particular lifestyle. III. NAAB Commitment This project is committed to meeting the NAAB criteria identified by the faculty. The first guideline is a checklist of the minimum 13 requirements that locates where in the process they are applicable to (see appendix ii). After reviewing the 2004 NAAB Student Performance Criteria, five additional areas are relevant to my project: (8) Western Traditions, (10) National and Regional Traditions, (13) Human Diversity, (15) Sustainable Design, (19) Environmental Systems, (24) Building Materials and Assemblies. IV. Site Description There are several good reasons to choose London for this proposal. First, the College already has an established program there. Second, existing conditions provide students new learning opportunities at a larger urban scale, while also offering first-hand experiences of architectural masterpieces. Based on recommendations made by past London mentors, two specific sites have been identified as are as of interest. Both sites are adjacent to Trafalgar Square, one a property on the Strand, another located at 20 Cockspur. A third site may likely surface after a visit to London this summer. Initial requirements for any proposed site include: nearby public transportation, incorporation of some part(s) of an existing building, and a location in an active urban area. In addition, it must provide enough space for the square footage necessitated by the program, as well as enhance the notion of a building that inspires. V. Methods Programming The initial constraints of the project will be refined this summer in order to aid in the selection of an appropriate site. Donna P. Duerk’s Architectural Programming provides the guideline for most programmatic issues. 1. Analysis of the existing state. During this phase, a site analysis, user profiles, codes, constraints, and climate, are studied along with interviews of past and future London program participates. In addition to meeting the initial site requirements, potential sites will undergo a detailed analysis. This project will attempt to understand the history of the site, including natural evolution, former use, image and association. Additional mapping of activity and circulation is necessary to understand traffic patterns at both vehicular and pedestrian levels. Several visits are needed document features such as weather, light, noise, and activity. It is essential to observe the site at various times of the day and make observations. Regarding sustainability, issues such as climate, building orientation, and ecological issues are to be documented. Throughout the site reconnaissance, photo interpretations and sketches are the integral medias used to observe. After extensive surveying is complete, information will be formulated into a concise and usable form. Both graphical and written statements will address the essential nature of the site for the purpose at hand. The intention of initial site planning is to respond to the site, not ignore it. 2. Projection of what the future state should be. The second stage of programming follows Duerk’s four steps in developing a program: create a mission statement, develop project goals, design measurable performance requirements, and develop conceptual relationships. First, the mission statement defines the intent of the project. Next, in order to accomplish the mission, goals are developed to express the level of quality to be reached by the final design regarding all design issues uncovered in the analysis phase. Then, in order to realize design goals the building must work in a way to promote certain attributes. A performance requirement is a statement of measurable function the design must live up to. Lastly, concepts must be developed in order to illustrate the ideal organizational level of function. Concluding the pre-design phase, additional case studies of similar programs, architecture educational facilities, dormitories, and adaptive reuse projects will be explored. Initial case studies include the John Soane House Museum in London and a Falkestrasse rooftop remodel in Vienna. These projects are similar to the proposal in how the context of the project lies within a historic architecture district. After a <b>finalized</b> <b>programming</b> document is produced and a specific site selected, comes the Project Description. This document clarifies the intent of the project and provides programmed space requirements. Following pre-design, the project will follow the traditional route of schematic design and design development for studio projects, with routine progress checks and more formal critics along the way...|$|R
40|$|The {{inception}} of the idea to domesticate the BFT as a European drive occurred while on a short sabbatical in Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Marine Policy Center in 1996. I {{was looking for a}} species or a group of species that will help close the developing gap between demand and supply of fish in the future, fish species that will serve, in times to come, as the “beef cattle” of the sea. I was looking for a species that has a fast growth rate, good ratio of edible meat to body weight (70 %) and a wide temperature range. After screening many species, I have come to considering the Blue Fin Tuna (BFT) as a candidate Species for Future Mariculture. Controlling the life cycle of the BFT will also help maintaining and enhancing its wild population in the future by developing a re-stocking program. I aired the idea with a few colleagues (who became friends over the years) and received encouraging reactions (first stations; CIHEAM meeting in Tanger, Morocco, and then at the Univ. of Cadiz, Spain). It turned out that my idea was not an original one - a few countries had already launched national BFT domestication programs. The initiative came on fertile soil: 55 participants, 25 different R&D institutions and industry around the Med., including Non EU members (Malta, Cyprus, Tunisia, Morocco, Croatia and Israel). We decided to apply for a Concerted Action Program in the Fifth Framework Programme under the “Quality of life and management of living resources” key action of the European Commission – Parallel to the national initiatives in Europe, which were taken place in Spain, Italy and France. The objectives of the Concerted Action program were to prepare the RTD campaign, including priorities, interdisciplinary methodology, rational interactions amongst the different scientific disciplines and the cascade of steps for implementation. Emphasis was on Integration of Fishing Industry, the BFT Farming Industry, governments and the RTD Program. We tried to draw inferences from lessons learned in other countries such as the USA, Australia, and Japan and design our program accordingly. We put together a good proposal. However, the proposal was rejected based on it being too ambitious and too weak on the socio-economics aspects. Well, it was a set back and a disappointment. However, we did not give up. We, resorted to the EU Accompanying Measure Program, wrote another proposal to fund a meeting in which the State of Art regarding the BFT different aspects will be told, experience of BFT farming around the world will be discussed and foundations for RTD proposals will be initiated. The proposal was accepted. We have formed a Steering Committee, which met 3 times (first to prepare the proposal, second to prepare the meeting and third, 3 weeks ago, to <b>finalize</b> the <b>program</b> of the Conference, and solve all the small problems that always crop up in the preparation of meetings like this one). We also spent many hours on the email exchanging ideas, written parts of the proposal and the conference to follow. The first Conference on the Domestication of the Blue Fin Tuna (DOTT) which was held in Cartagena, Spain, and which this volume is presenting most of the presentations offered during the 5 days meeting, should be considered as a successful event. I, for one, am very happy with the conference itself and the outcome. We have been informed on most BFT activities around the world; state of the wild populations, BFT fisheries and landings, BFT fattening operations {{in different parts of the}} world such as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Malta, Croatia and Spain. There were very enlighten session on many of the BFT biological traits such as reproduction, larval rearing, nutrition, as well as behavioral and straddling aspects of this species. Most of the reports where given by people who have had direct experience in dealing with the BFT, however, many presentations had theoretical components in them. Following the plenary sessions, which lasted two and a half days, the participants were divided into workshops, which dealt with a few major disciplines concerning the domestication of the BFT. Most of the workshops lasted for two sessions of a few hours each. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to come up with a program and a skeleton for a research proposal to be submitted to the EU RTD Commission in Brussels. The first workshop was held still in the plenary forum and was devoted to the reproduction of the BFT. It was done as a demonstration and guideline to the other workshops, since a proposal in this field was submitted and approved by Brussels at the time. We had four workshops on the following subjects: 1. Socio-economics and environmental aspects of farming the BFT. 2. Larval and juvenile production of the BFT 3. Husbandry and nutrition of BFT farming 4. Engineering aspects of BFT farming. Short summaries of the above workshops can be found in the proceedings. The closing session of the conference was devoted to drawing a set of resolutions and adopting them by the plenary forum. These resolutions are aimed at increasing the awareness of the public, the different governments and the EU Community and its administration prospects of domestication the BFT and what it involves. The amended resolutions are attached to this chapter of the proceedings. We hope that the DOTT Conference has initiated a campaign, which will, eventually bring about the farming and restocking of the Bluefin Tuna. A worthwhile campaign, which will come to fruition in the next decade or two. On Behalf of the Steering Committee I want to thank a couple of funding institutions and a few key people that without their efforts and hard work this event would have stayed as an unrealised dream: The EU Commission for funding the DOTT conference, The Marine Policy Centre of Woods Hole Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole, Mass., USA My colleagues, who became friends, on the Steering Committee: Antonio Garcia and, the Spanish National Coordinator and Fernando de la Gandara both from IEO, Mazarron, without whom this meeting could not have happened.
