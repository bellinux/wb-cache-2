2500|$|While Magnolia {{struggled}} {{at the box}} office, it was well-received critically. [...] it has an 84% [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes, {{based on}} 118 [...] "fresh" [...] reviews out of 141. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "the most imperfect of the year's best movies". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert praised the film, saying: [...] "Magnolia {{is the kind of}} film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating, praising Cruise's performance: [...] "It's with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of Eyes Wide Shut ... Like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business". The Independent said that the film was [...] "limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. Magnolia does not have the last word on anything. But is superb". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Tom Cruise's performance: [...] "Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It's great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "In the case of Magnolia, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Anderson has taken us to the water's edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, 'You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have never}} heard him say that; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gradfield does those things. Owen, I am afraid, is inexperienced as yet.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs</b> Pipkin was right, {{and that}} Mrs Hurtle, {{with all her}} faults, was a good-natured woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evening, Mr. Lind," [...] said Conolly, {{coming up}} to them with the umbrellas. [...] "This is yours, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Leith Fairfax." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never again." [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Fursey took a {{pleasure}} in the phrase. It sounded, as she said it, {{like something out of}} the prayer-book.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean you}} were indelicate, really, Alma, but I wanted to warn you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Beaton {{was very much}} in earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our supper-party, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Laverick," [...] she said, [...] "has {{been quite}} a success. We shall before long, I hope, meet again." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS P.--They {{have been}} a little spoiled, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Milliken will send George and Arabella to school, mamma: will you not, Horace? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] sighed Clementina. [...] "Mrs. Lander, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Milray {{means what}} she says, at the time, {{but she is}} one that seems to forget." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a hint of}} reproach in the glance Jessie favoured him with. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Nairn {{might have}} brought you over to see us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ludlow said, [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Rangeley is right. I {{would much}} rather yield to compulsion. I don't mind telling what kept me, if I'm obliged to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly; {{taking it}} all {{together}} it's such a pity, you know. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Harding, he can hardly have intended to steal the money." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. DUDGEON. And {{this is my}} reward! (raging inwardly) You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Anderson you know the word I gave to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{not exactly}} at this moment, though a rally might afford an opportunity. The estate is entailed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dutton told me, at dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} I am romantic, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Dillon did not exaggerate," [...] Laura rejoined. [...] "Jimmy is our friend and trusts us. His note is a call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was sixteen' said Oliver. 'It was {{the year}} '13. I will have the drawing-room hung with blue brocade, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Roland Dynevor will own that nothing can exceed it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{certainly}} rather a strong word,' said Lady Merton, 'but you will {{allow me to}} say that she has a great dread of her; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hazleby scolds and frightens her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that would be about it. They are long odds, but not too long, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lyons. At any rate, we will try.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, master. The gentleman when I {{take him}} his bath water he speak to me. He ask me—he ask—when, when, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Walter, he come back.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Clemens {{is right}} in feeling that he {{should get out of}} business, that he is not fitted for it; it worries him too much.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Advances towards MRS. CHEVELEY {{with a sweet}} smile. Then {{suddenly}} stops, {{and bows}} rather distantly.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Cheveley and <b>I</b> have met before. I did not know she had married a second time.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> ----'s prose very admirable; but I don't believe it! No, I do not. My {{conviction}} is {{that those}} islanders get frightfully bored by the islands, and wish they had never set eyes upon them! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not always, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Doolan," [...] he said quietly; [...] "but {{you have}} {{certainly}} made yourselves wonderfully at home, though your sewing is {{of a more}} practical kind than that upon which you are ordinarily engaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We all {{enjoyed your}} singing so much, last night, Miss Blood. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hicks plays charmingly, but I believe I prefer {{to hear your}} voice alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't we?" [...] {{demanded the}} other girl. [...] "I don't believe those stories, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Porter {{and his friends}} ought {{to know what is}} being said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fields {{is really}} amusing--sometimes," [...] said Barbara. [...] "Here {{is a letter}} for you, dear, that came by special {{delivery}} just after you had gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Crocker {{is in her}} room, Mr. James. She {{ordered the}} car to be brought round at once. It should be here at any moment now, sir. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Crocker intends to visit the Park before luncheon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't like Mrs. Thomas, and I wouldn't for {{worlds that}} she should have had {{anything}} to do with it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Thomas has behaved very bad to me; so I do. And you don't half know her;--that you don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was what}} I suspected, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Dalton knows. George {{was not very}} steady {{when he was at}} home and got into some trouble before he left the office of a civil engineer. In fact, this was why he went to Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{affection for}} Tredowen," [...] she {{repeated}} wonderingly. [...] "Do {{you know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Pengarth? I {{think that it is}} the most beautiful house in the world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Nothing new. Bothered about Sidricstone till one. Got away at last {{with an old}} fox, {{and over}} the downs into the vale. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Stangrave liked it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Charley,' {{returned}} his sister, detaining {{his hand as}} he withdrew it, 'I think you had better stay. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mr</b> Headstone had better not say {{what he thinks of}} saying.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we were in}} any way {{bound to}} her, of course we would do our duty. But if it makes mamma unhappy I am sure you will not press it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Merton has spoken to her. And then Aunt Stanbury has written such letters!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} can see it in that way," [...] said Westover, [...] "and since you do, I don't mind saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Vostrand might have been a little franker with you without being less kind. She was kind, but she wasn't quite frank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be difficult; {{we are all}} cronies of Captain Jim. He will be {{as eager}} to see you as you could be to see him. Your {{grandmother}} shines like a star in his memory. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Moore is expecting you. I'll show you our 'cross-lots' road." ...|$|R
