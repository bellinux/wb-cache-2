5|$|Both in 1991 {{and years}} later, Špegelj criticised Tuđman's {{decision}} to disregard his advice {{to attack the}} JNA barracks earlier than Septemberspecifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in JuneJuly 1991. Špegelj said that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of the strategic situation in Croatia, would best serve Croatian defensive needs. Furthermore, {{he said that the}} JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise the required forces and that all prerequisites for a decisive victory against the JNA were met. Tus thought that Tuđman kept postponing the blockade because of the pressure applied by the international community against confrontation with the JNA. Zdravko Tomac, deputy prime minister of a national unity government in Croatia at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while Špegelj's view was militarily correct, Tuđman's position was politically better. Kadijević conversely said that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces had confronted <b>it</b> <b>earlier</b> because the JNA's capabilities declined during the summer of 1991.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Lylat System, General Pepper {{contacts}} the Star Fox Team, asking them to investigate the invasion of the Dinosaur Planet. Since the team are desperate for money and maintenance, Fox McCloud agrees to take a look, arriving unarmed at Pepper's request to avoid trouble with the locals. On the planet's surface, Fox obtains and wields the magic staff which Krystal lost <b>it</b> <b>earlier.</b> Fox learns from the Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that Scales stole four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples. To prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, Fox restores the stones to the temples, {{with the help of the}} Queen's son, Prince Tricky. As Fox retrieves the stones, he discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet and save Krystal. When Fox finds the last of the spirits, he discovers that it is guarded by Scales himself. However, just as Fox and Scales engage in combat, a mysterious voice orders Scales to surrender the spirit, to which he reluctantly agrees. Fox takes the spirit to the Krazoa Shrine and frees Krystal.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Trung {{took off}} again and flew out to Phước Long Province, which {{was occupied by}} the Provisional Revolutionary Government since North Vietnamese troops had captured <b>it</b> <b>earlier</b> in the year, and he was warmly received by North Vietnamese soldiers. The North Vietnamese claimed that Trung had been a Viet Cong agent since 1969, and was infiltrated into the Republic of Vietnam Air Force where he served with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force 540th Fighter Squadron of the 3rd Air Force Division. Trung later revealed that he was originally from Bến Tre Province in the Mekong region, where his father had served as the district secretary of the People's Revolutionary Party. In 1963 Trung's father was killed and his body was mutilated by the South Vietnamese police. Angered {{by the death of}} his father, Trung vowed to take revenge on the South Vietnamese Government, so in 1969 he secretly joined the Viet Cong after he had been accepted into the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.|$|E
5|$|While the ON had {{competed in}} some local {{elections}} since 1970, at its second congress in June 1972 {{it decided to}} establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, the ON sought to model the new party (as <b>it</b> <b>earlier</b> had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition for the Italian right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. It wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together Le Pen's nationalist group, Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity, Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement, former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure on the far-right.|$|E

25|$|A headstone (tombstone) {{is known}} as a matzevah (monument). Although there is no Halakhic {{obligation}} to hold an unveiling ceremony (the ritual became popular in many communities {{toward the end of the}} 19th century), there are varying customs about when it should be placed on the grave. Most communities have an unveiling ceremony a year after the death. Some communities have <b>it</b> <b>earlier,</b> even a week after the burial. In Israel it is done after the shloshim (the first 30 days of mourning). There is no universal restriction about the timing, other than the unveiling cannot be held during Shabbat, (work-restricted) Jewish Holidays or Chol Ha'Moed.|$|E

25|$|The first menstrual {{bleeding}} {{is referred}} to as menarche, and typically occurs about two years after thelarche. The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the United States. Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience <b>it</b> <b>earlier</b> than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of menarche is 12.72, and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9. The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular {{in the first two years}} after menarche. Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year. Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.|$|E
