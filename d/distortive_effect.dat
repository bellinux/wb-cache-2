Writing in 1994, {{he was one of}} the first scholars to suggest that the political objectives of the environmentalist movement were exerting a <b>distortive</b> <b>effect</b> upon climate science. As Niskanen wrote, [...] "One consequence of the distortion of science is that substantial resources are spent to reduce minimal risk at the expense of other activities that would reduce risk at a much lower cost." [...] While Niskanen did not deny the existence of global warming or even human contributions to this phenomenon, he questioned the severity of the trend and argued that we should not fear moderate global warming. Drastic policy interventions to correct for climate change, he warned, were too severe for a problem that he considered modest and even in some cases beneficial, such as the increase in the world food supply brought about by longer crop growing periods. He concluded that most proposals to address climate change did not pass the cost-benefit analysis test.|$|E

We then empirically examine the response of Israelis to terror incidents during the "Al-Aqsa " Intifada.

Prior attempts at resolving these issues have been focusing for the most part on hierarchical structures or transaction-based models that mainly replicate traditional market logics. We propose here a new model of distributed governance for social innovation communities, based on a gratitude-based reward and reputation system that could promote inclusion and participation within these communities, without incurring the costs associated with centralized decision-making and without engaging into the <b>distortive</b> <b>effects</b> of today's market-based transactions...|$|R

When a uniform income tax rate is used for financing federal expenditure, the shadow price of housing exceeds the market price in the larger cities, indicating that the stock of housing is too small and the per-capita housing consumption is too large. The opposite is true in small cities, where also, if housing and the LPG (local public good) are net substitutes, the provision of the LPG is excessive.

This chapter examines the restrictions on short selling France, which introduced a naked short selling ban and disclosure regime for financial stocks. The study shows that the overall effect of the short selling ban in France was not positive. The introduction of the ban was followed by a short period in which affected stocks slightly outperformed unaffected stocks, which could be attributed to certain short-term behavioral effects of the short selling ban. However, the statistical analysis presented earlier shows that the portfolios of restricted and unrestricted stocks evolve with only minor differences. The comparison of France and Switzerland reveals that Swiss financial stocks, which were affected by the ban for only 3 months, move in an almost identical manner as French ones {{both inside and outside the}} ban period in Switzerland. Swedish financial stocks denominated in euros perform worse than French stocks, although if the <b>distortive</b> <b>effect</b> of the krona's depreciation is eliminated, it produces a high degree of similarity.

This particular issue, however, could be addressed with a two-stage estimation strategy that exploits the comparative advantages of both parametric and nonparametric approaches, applying the DEA procedure in the first stage just to measure efficiency scores on a flexible way and then modelling by a parametric function the variability on these scores on a second stage. The use of such a two-stage model has been recurrently employed to measure efficiency levels on other fields, but is not common in the analysis of efficiency in higher education systems. 4 To the best of our knowledge, the only application in this field is the work by Wolszczak-Derlacz and Parteka (2011), which applied it to explain efficiency on the universities of European Union countries.|$|R

More recently, in the United States, plea bargaining has raised diametric concerns that the criminal justice system is too soft on criminals by allowing those who admit guilt to serve a lighter sentence than what they might otherwise deserve. These concerns have resulted in efforts to limit the discretion of the prosecutor to engage in plea bargaining. In contrast, Italy is currently examining ways to broaden the application of trial-avoidance procedures.

40|$|The paper investigates labor {{reallocation}} across main {{economic sectors}} between 1989 and 2007 in the CEE 2 countries, now {{all members of}} the EU, using a methodology presented in Jackman and Puna (1997). Defining a series of indices aimed at capturing the speed, magnitude and efficiency of employment reallocation, the work assesses {{the extent to which these}} countries have succeeded in converging towards distributions of sectoral employment similar to those in the old EU members. The work shows that, overall, the CEE countries have made progress towards reallocating jobs from the oversized labor intensive sectors, characteristic of the early years of transition, such as agriculture and heavy industries, towards the services sector. However, convergence has been relatively slow and its pace has been different from country to country. Bulgaria emerges as the country where the fastest restructuring has taken place, and in the right direction. Romania, in particular, appears to have made least progress, although it is also moving in the right direction. The still large agricultural sector, which continued to hire around 30 % of the occupied population in 2007, remains an area which will require further and massive restructuring. As of 2007, in the case of Romania, around 40 % of the jobs expected to be created in the growing sectors, computed by benchmarking actual job destruction and job creation against the comparator economy, have occurred. The figure increases to over 50 %, when the <b>distortive</b> <b>effect</b> of agriculture is removed.

Ensemble Monte-Carlo algorithms are developed {{in order to determine the}} electron transport properties of these materials, coupled with derived expressions for a novel band-structure approximation based on the cosine form that incorporates the inflection point in the Γ valley. The algorithm is validated by comparison of the output of the simulation with the well characteristics of other III-V semiconductors, and the new band-structure approximation is validated through comparison of the generated characteristics with experimental work and the output of the balance equations. Characteristics for GaN (bulk and in a 1 D device) are presented, with excellent agreement with other works. It is found in bulk systems that there is the possibility of a significant number of negative-effective mass states occurring in GaN, dependent on inter sub-band (Γ- L-M) energy separation, and that these states have a noticeable effect on the characteristics of the system, both equilibrium and transient, particularly on the occurrence of the negative differential velocity in the velocity characteristics. A proof-of-concept algorithm for a 1 D device code incorporating GaN is also presented with favourable results. Two models for bulk dilute GaNAs are used, one based on the Nitrogen Scattering model to measure the dispersive effect of N impurities, and one modeling the lower E−band from the BAC model with the cosine band-structure approximation to measure the <b>distortive</b> <b>effect.</b> Both models are used to generate equilibrium and transient characteristics for the material and we find that we have good agreement with recent works, particularly with the nitrogen scattering model...|$|E

The electron-lattice coupling associated with the eg(Exe) and t 2 g(Txe) orbitals of Cu 2 + in CuWO 4 are obtained from correlations between the JT distortion of the CuO 6 octahedron and the associated structure of Cu 2 + d-electronic levels. This distortion and its associated JT energy (EJT) decrease upon compression in both phases. However, both the distortion and associated EJT increase sharply at the phase transition pressure (PT = 9. 9 GPa) and we estimate that the JT distortion persists for a wide pressure range not being suppressed up to 37 GPa. These results shed light on the transition mechanism of multiferroic CuWO 4 suggesting that the pressureinduced structural phase transition is a way to minimize the <b>distortive</b> <b>effects</b> associated with the toughness of the JT distortion.
