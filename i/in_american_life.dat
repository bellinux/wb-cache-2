The {{cultural}} range of his music has expanded {{to the point where}} it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.... Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, a 23-year-old Earl, {{armed with}} several bottles of his father's horse liniment, joined {{with his brother}} Foreman in St. Louis, Missouri, where Foreman was engaged in the buying and {{shipping}} of horses. This time period immediately following the Civil War marked {{the heyday of the}} horse <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> Consequently, the Sloan liniment formula was in great demand. For about twenty-five years, Earl and his brother peddled their remedy from farm to farm, and also worked the horse fairs and carnivals.|$|E
25|$|What of {{the latest}} {{currents}} of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Life</b> (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.|$|E

25|$|The 1930s led Weston {{away from}} art, however. The {{national}} crisis {{brought about by}} the Great Depression brought out Weston's social and political consciousness. When in 1936 the Treasury Relief Art Project asked him to paint murals for the General Services Administration building in Washington, D.C., Weston eagerly agreed. Over the next two years, Weston created 22 panels that depict moments in the construction process. Realizing that his GSA work had to inspire as well as be visually pleasing, Weston adopted motifs from the art deco movement because the style was associated with a forward-looking, positive time <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> Weston also turned away from abstraction and toward photo-realism.|$|E
25|$|In 1894–95 Gilman {{served as}} editor of the {{magazine}} The Impress, a literary weekly that was published by the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (formerly the Bulletin). For the twenty weeks the magazine was printed, she was consumed in the satisfying accomplishment of contributing its poems, editorials, and other articles. The short-lived paper's printing came to an end {{as a result of a}} social bias against her lifestyle which included being an unconventional mother and a woman who had divorced a man. After a four-month-long lecture tour that ended in April 1897, Gilman began to think more deeply about sexual relationships and economics <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life,</b> eventually completing the first draft of Women and Economics (1898). This book discussed the role of women in the home, arguing for changes in the practices of child-raising and housekeeping to alleviate pressures from women and potentially allow them to expand their work to the public sphere. The book was published in the following year, and propelled Gilman into the international spotlight. In 1903, she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin, and, the next year, toured in England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Relatively late in {{life the}} secular Brandeis also became a {{prominent}} figure in the Zionist movement. He became active in the Federation of American Zionists in 1912, {{as a result of}} a conversation with Jacob de Haas, according to some. His involvement provided the nascent American Zionist movement one of the most distinguished men <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> and a friend of the next president. Over the next several years he devoted a great deal of his time, energy, and money to championing the cause. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, the divided allegiance of its membership rendered the World Zionist Organization impotent. American Jews then assumed a larger responsibility independent of Zionists in Europe. The Provisional Executive Committee for Zionist Affairs was established in New York for this purpose on August 20, 1914, and Brandeis was elected president of the organization. As president from 1914 to 1918, Brandeis became the leader and spokesperson of American Zionism. He embarked on a speaking tour in the fall and winter of 1914–1915 to garner support for the Zionist cause, emphasizing the goal of self-determination and freedom for Jews through the development of a Jewish homeland.|$|E

500|$|Gerolmo {{described}} his original draft script as [...] "a big, passionate, violent detective story {{set against the}} greatest sea-change <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> in the 20th century, the civil rights movement". For legal reasons, {{the names of the}} people and certain details related to the FBI's investigation were changed. On presenting Clinton Pell's wife as an informant, Gerolmo said, [...] "...the fact that no one knew who Mr. X, the informant, was, left that as a dramatic possibility for me, in my Hollywood movie version of the story. That's why Mr. X became the wife of one of the conspirators." [...] The abductor of Mayor Tilman was originally written as a Mafia hitman who forces a confession by putting a pistol in Tillman's mouth. Gerolmo was inspired by Gregory Scarpa, a mob enforcer recruited by the FBI during their search for Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.|$|E

500|$|McCain became {{chairman}} of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995, and would hold that position into 1997. [...] McCain's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg's well-received The Nightingale's Song, a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> [...] At {{the start of the}} 1996 presidential election, McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas Senator Phil Gramm. [...] After Gramm dropped out, McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks. [...] McCain formed a close bond with Dole, based in part on their shared near-death war experiences; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign.|$|E
500|$|Rossen {{was one of}} the {{directors}} who developed film gris (French for [...] "grey film"). In his films for Warner Brothers' between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After Dust Be My Destiny, written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for The New York Times, complained about Warner Brothers' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: [...] "The element common to many of my films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization." [...] Polonsky commented that [...] "Rossen's talent is force applied everywhere without let-up." [...] Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen's works, but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Author Lucy O'Brien {{wrote in her}} biography, , that the techno composition and the stuttering vocals made the song [...] "an almost anti-Bond theme". James Hannaham from Spin was positive in his review, writing {{that it is a}} [...] "brilliant, melodramatic song, that sounds like a stoic response to a world gone mad." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Music, Dan Gennoe felt that since the songs <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Life</b> mostly gave prominence to style over substance, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as a result had become one-dimensional. Stylus Magazine's Ed Howard described the song as [...] "a great slice-and-dice hit of fucked-up electroclash", in an otherwise negative review for American Life. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine considered it [...] "forward-thinking" [...] and believed that the record was added to American Lifes track list to ensure that the album would not be devoid of a hit song. Clover described the track as [...] "A blistering zeitgeist-negation, hostile and uneasy—as a single, a club track, a Bond theme." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard was positive in his response, saying that the electronic effects rendered Madonna's vocals as non-discernible but the composition was forward thinking from Music (2000), her eighth studio album.|$|E
