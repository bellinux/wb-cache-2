40|$|As {{part of the}} Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) {{for each}} special nuclear {{materials}} package, experimental tests or an analysis must be performed to determine the temperature distribution throughout the package when exposed to normal conditions of transport. These normal conditions include two cases - one with insolation and one without insolation. Insolation (total solar heat load) values {{to be used in}} the analyses are given in 10 CFR 71. 71; however, the manner in which the insolation is to be applied is not specified. Several approaches can be taken: (1) perform a steady-state analysis assuming the insolation is applied continuously, (2) perform a transient analysis assuming the incident insolation is represented by a step function (i. e., insolation is applied and then not applied in 12 -hour cycles), or (3) perform a transient analysis where the incident insolation is represented by a more complex function involving variables such as time of day. The purpose of this paper is to present these various approaches and examine the effect they have on package temperature distributions. The DC- 1 shipping package with the Z 88 can was used for the analyses to represent a typical thin-walled Celotex-based shipping package. The results of the study indicate that the method used in applying the insolation has a significant effect on the outermost portions of the package. Maximum outer container temperatures were found to vary by as much as 19. 3 {degree}C depending on which insolation method was used. Typically, <b>internal</b> <b>package</b> temperatures are more critical in this type of analysis. Since the total insolation over any 24 -hour period is the same for all cases, <b>internal</b> <b>package</b> temperatures (secondary containment vessel, primary containment vessel, content, etc.) are relatively unaffected by the way in which the insolation is applied. <b>Internal</b> <b>package</b> temperatures vary no more than 2 {degree}C for the three insolation methods investigated...|$|E

Basic methods using empirical calibration with a standard in order to quantify the activity of nuclear materials by determining the calibration coefficient are useless on non-reproducible, complex and single nuclear objects such as waste packages. Package specifications as composition or geometry change from one package to another and involve a high variability of objects. Current quantification process uses numerical modelling of the measured scene with few available data such as geometry or composition. These data are density, material, screen, geometric shape, matrix composition, matrix and source distribution. Some of them are strongly dependent on package data knowledge and operator backgrounds.

HEMA is a hydrophilic monomer, which polymerizes under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Active components can be evenly distributed in liquid HEMA and then entrapped in HEMA films through UV polymerization. ^ The overall hypothesis for this project is that HEMA can be applicable for active packaging materials to immobilize enzymes, and active components can be incorporated into HEMA based films to scavenge oxygen and provide antimicrobial properties. ^ In this study, physical and mechanical properties of HEMA based films were characterized; the results indicated that incorporating plasticizers polyethylene glycol and glycerol significantly increased the water vapor permeability and increase the flexibility of the films. Immobilization of glucose oxidase using a HEMA based formula was successful in terms of retaining activity of the immobilized enzymes under various pH and temperature conditions and maintaining high activity after sixty days of storage at 7 °C. The immobilized glucose oxidase demonstrated different optimum temperature and pH than free glucose oxidase.

40|$|A MEMS-based Safety and Arming (S&A) {{device is}} being {{developed}} {{for the next generation}} of Navy torpedoes. The MEMS-based S&A consists of a high aspect ratio MEMS chip fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon on insulator substrates (SOI). The micro-machined structures, which include environmental sensors, actuators, and optical components, are susceptible to stiction related failures. A robust package is essential to transform the fragile MEMS S&A device into a rugged package capable of reliably functioning throughout the military stockpile to target sequence. To adequately protect the MEMS device from deleterious effects of the external environment, the package must be housed in a hermetic, organic-free package. This dissertation presents the design of, analyzes, and qualifies a die-level fluxless packaging concept. The die-level package consists of a metallized seal ring patterned around the perimeter of the chip, including the fiber groove, sidewalls, and base. The fiber grooves provide a fiber optic interconnect between the microstructure area and the macro-environment. A cap chip, with a matching seal ring, completes the clamshell package. Solder is deposited onto the seal ring and in the grooves at the wafer-level on the device and cap chips. A fluxless, and hence organic-free, soldering process joins and seals the fiber-chip assembly on the chip-level. The conditions that govern fluxless soldering are addressed and tailored for success in the developed design. Surface energy models are used to understand the fluxless soldering conditions and to study the geometric stability of fluid solder joints at the fiber to chip interface. Several techniques for fabrication of the chips and assembly of the packages are investigated. The effects of leak rate of the package seal on the <b>internal</b> <b>package</b> environment are discussed in detail to establish an acceptable leak rate of small volume MEMS packages.

40|$|To ensure {{profitable}} margins, European pear fruit {{producers are}} forced to explore more and more distant overseas markets. After controlled atmosphere storage, however, pear fruit is susceptible to relatively fast quality loss if conditions during packaged transport are sub-optimal. Both excessive water loss (causing weak necks and shrivelling) and accumulation of carbon dioxide from respiration (causing internal disorders) could cause severe losses {{at the point of}} delivery and lead to an unacceptable reduction of shelf life at the destination. To properly design and optimize transport of pear fruit, therefore, analysis of temperature, humidity and respiratory gas conditions in the package is required. To this end, a modelling approach is proposed. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed that solves flow, heat and mass transfer inside pear fruit packages. The mass transfer model includes both transport of water vapour from the fruit and transport of gasses due to fruit respiration. The fruit load inside the package is generated using discrete element simulations of fruit filling using a statistical shape model of pear fruit (cv. Conference).

One acceptable means of evaluating packaging performance is to subject packagings to the series of NCT and HAC tests.

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1996 at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory Radioactive Waste Management Complex, an {{epidemic}} of corroded CH-TRU waste drums was encountered. The observed corrosion was {{in the form of}} rusty brown streaks that emanated from pinholes in about the upper one-third of the 55 gal drums. Wet streaks were tested as highly acidic by litmus paper. The liquid that emanated from the pinholes was found to be hydrochloric (HCl) acid. An investigation concluded that the pinholes were localized pitting corrosion caused by HCl acid formed in the drum headspace from reactions involving chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the waste and the unlined steel of the internal drum wall. The pinholes occurred in the upper parts of the drums because this corresponds to the internal headspace region above the rigid liner. Affected drums had a few to hundreds of pinholes with no detectable release of radioactivity. This was due to the <b>internal</b> <b>packaging</b> of waste in heavy polyethylene and/or polyvinyl chloride waste bags inside a rigid high-density polyethylene liner. The corrective action taken was to overpack pinhole corrosion drums into polyethylene-lined 83 -gal drums and to test hundreds of drums with drum filters, but without pinhole corrosion, for the presence of HCl acid in the headspace gas with colorimetric tubes fitted to the drum filters. These colorimetric tubes contain a substance that changes color in reaction to HCl acid when headspace gas is drawn by a hand pump. Only drums that had a significant probability for the presence of HCl acid in the headspace were segregated in storage to allow ready inspection and efficient handling, if needed. It is recommended that any facility involved in the long-term storage of waste or other contents, that include chlorinated VOCs in unlined steel containers, be wary for the possible development of pinhole corrosion...|$|R
25|$|After Labor's {{landslide}} victory, Hawke {{was sworn}} in as the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia by the Governor-General on 11 March 1983. The inaugural days of the Hawke Government were distinctly {{different from those of the}} Whitlam Government. Rather than immediately initiating extensive reform programmes as Whitlam had, Hawke announced that Malcolm Fraser's pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor's election commitments would have to be deferred. As part of his <b>internal</b> reforms <b>package,</b> Hawke divided the Government into two tiers, with only the most senior ministers sitting in the Cabinet. The Labor caucus was still given the authority to determine who would make up the Ministry, but gave Hawke unprecedented powers for a Labor Prime Minister to select which individual ministers would comprise the 13-strong Cabinet.|$|R
