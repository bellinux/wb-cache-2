40|$|Marketing claims abound for “green ” or {{environmentally}} friendly batteries, frequently based on {{low energy consumption}} during <b>float</b> <b>charging.</b> Before buying into such claims, the user should {{find out about the}} bigger picture. How much energy is used in manufacturing the battery? How much energy is used in recycling the battery, and how frequently must it be recycled? A proper view of energy savings can only be achieved through a rigorous Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which analyzes energy usage at all phases of a battery’s manufacturing, operation and recycling. This paper discusses the elements of the LCA and provides an example. Going beyond the LCA, batteries can achieve or contribute to energy savings in two other ways: through overall system design; and by enabling applications, operating modes or devices that save energy. An example of the former is the use of temperature-resistant batteries to allow air-conditioning costs to be reduced; and the latter case is exemplified by the various types of hybrid electric vehicles that are in dealers ’ showrooms or in development. Further examples are provided in this paper, showing that under the right conditions and with the right choice of technology, batteries can indeed provide significant energy savings...|$|E

2500|$|A stricter regime {{exists for}} <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> under IA 1986 section 245 that could {{prejudice}} other creditors in the {{run up to}} insolvency. Any <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> created up to one year {{before the onset of}} insolvency is avoidable at the company's instance if new money was not advanced to the company in return. So a company cannot grant a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> to a creditor to secure past advances made by that creditor, unless given at least [...] "at the same time". In Re Shoe Lace Ltd Hoffmann J held that £350,000 advanced in April and May was not close enough to a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> created in July to be considered [...] "at the same time". The <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> could not secure those amounts. Because the context of the legislation was a business one, and {{in view of the fact}} that <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> can be registered up to 21 days after their creation, a few months was far too long. Second 245 only rescinds the charge, and not the debt itself, which remains in effect as before. Yet the creditor becomes unsecured and ranks alongside other creditors. Banks operating accounts for companies in overdraft have an advantage in this respect. Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd held that if the overall level of debt remains the same, before and after a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> is created, and if money turns over by payments of the company in and withdrawals out, the bank's continued extension of credit will continually [...] "harden" [...] their <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b> Although Yeovil Glove Co LTd was always indebted to the bank before a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was created, and was indebted at the point of insolvency, because it had deposited and withdrawn a greater amount, the bank's <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was considered secure. Finally, Companies Act 2006, section 874 stipulates that any <b>charge,</b> including a <b>floating</b> <b>charge,</b> that is not registered is considered void.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> {{operation}} of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries in standby power applications. While the telecommunication standby power {{system is the}} targeted application, the results are applicable in any situation where VRLA batteries are subjected to long periods of <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The goals of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> are identified and a test and analysis procedure is developed to provide a means of assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} applied <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The primary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to counteract the natural self-discharge of the battery and indefinitely maintain it in a fully charged state. A secondary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to maximise the life of the battery. This is achieved by ensuring that ageing mechanisms such as positive grid corrosion and gas venting are maintained at minimum levels. The problems associated with conventional <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> control are investigated and, in particular, the electrode imbalance problems associated with some long life VRLA cells are detailed. These electrode imbalance problems can result in the cell suffering a gradual discharge of the negative electrode while the cell appears healthy and on a <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> This ultimately results in reduced cell capacity and is identified as a major cause of the premature failure of long life VRLA cells. <b>Float</b> <b>charge</b> analysis and the subsequent optimisation relies heavily on knowledge of the polarisation distribution between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell. Conventionally, this is determined {{with the aid of a}} reference electrode, although such testing is only possible in a well-controlled laboratory environment. By modelling the steady state and transient features of both the positive and negative electrodes, a test and analysis procedure is developed to estimate the polarisation distribution within a conventional 2 V VRLA cell, in effect creating a virtual reference electrode. The developed procedure exploits differences in the transient response of each electrode to estimate their polarisations at the applied float voltage. The polarisation estimations are typically accurate to within 10 mV, the window of polarisation relating to minimal positive grid corrosion is approximately 40 mV wide, and the total polarisation applied to a VRLA cell is around 130 mV. The test requires only a very low rate constant current discharge, and cell terminal voltage measurements. This test may be automated and applied to cells in field service, and provides the necessary measure to gauge <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> optimisation. The developed test is able to verify that a cell on <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is indeed fully charged, and assists in determining the optimal float voltage for maximum cell life...|$|R
2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A <b>floating</b> <b>charge,</b> in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a fixed charge on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could set-off claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b> Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an automatic crystallisation clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> to be converted to a fixed charge on notice, and this was done one week before a voluntary winding up resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the contractual freedom of parties to a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a <b>floating</b> <b>charge,</b> it would deem to remain a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of the corporate}} form {{has resulted in a}} state of dependency by the economy on the companies operating within it. These companies require the free flow of capital for investment, growth, and avoidance of precipitate insolvency. For over a century, the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> has played a cardinal role in the provision of credit to companies in the UK. Over the same period, the charge has undergone several statutory interventions raising doubts as to the ability of financiers to rely on the charge as a basis for extending and securing credit. This thesis explores the impact of some of these changes on lending practices and insolvency outcomes. The changes examined primarily relate to the redistribution of <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> assets in favour of other creditors in insolvency. The thesis uses analytical and empirical research methods. There are six chapters in the thesis. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a commercial background to the study and identify the research question; they explore the impact of companies on the economy, and the importance of credit and security. Chapter 3 contains an empirical account of the impact that the treatment of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> in insolvency has on lending practices and insolvency outcomes. Chapter 4 examines the interest conferred by a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> against current inroads into the rights of a floating chargee. Chapter 5 scrutinises the raison d’être for redistributing <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> assets. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by providing analytical commentary on proposals regarding the future of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> and factoring. This is followed by a Postscript which summarises the arguments and evidence contained in the thesis, and sets out a number of recommendations. The thesis will show that the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> is still used in corporate finance transactions. Proposals to unify company security interests would not affect this.

2500|$|While both {{need to be}} registered, the {{distinction}} between a fixed and a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> matters greatly because <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> are subordinated by the Insolvency Act 1986 to insolvency practitioners' expenses under section 176ZA, preferential creditors (employees' wages up to £800 per person, pension contributions and the EU coal and steel levies) under section 175 and Schedule 6 and unsecured creditors' claims up {{to a maximum of}} £600,000 under section 176A. The <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was invented as a form of security in the late nineteenth century, as a concept which would apply to the whole of the assets of an undertaking. The leading company law case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, exemplified that a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> holder (even if it was the director and almost sole shareholder of the company) could enforce their priority ahead of all other persons. As Lord MacNaghten said, [...] "Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is." [...] Parliament responded with the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after fixed charge holders, but before <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> holders.
