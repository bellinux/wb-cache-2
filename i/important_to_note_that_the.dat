It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so {{there can be a}} strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

25|$|This is why {{the real}} forms are {{extensively}} used in basis functions for quantum chemistry, as the programs don't then need to use complex algebra. Here, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> real functions span the same space as the complex ones would.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{distinction}} between the global and local versions is that the former relates maps between sheaves, whereas the latter relates (complexes of) sheaves directly and so can be evaluated locally.

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Durbin–Watson statistic, while {{displayed}} by many regression analysis programs, is not applicable in certain situations.

Durbin's h-test (see below) or likelihood ratio tests, that are valid in large samples, should be used.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ashokavadana being a Buddhist text in itself sought to gain new {{converts}} for Buddhism and so used all these legends. Devotion to the Buddha and loyalty to the sangha are stressed. Such texts added to the perception that Ashoka was essentially the ideal Buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation.|$|E
25|$|Question Period in Canada, as an {{instance}} of Question time in Westminster tradition, {{is similar to the}} Prime Minister's Questions practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; however it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Canadian version occurs daily as opposed to weekly, runs 45 minutes instead of 30 and questions may be asked to any cabinet member, not just the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that shows that glutamine is transferred across the root interface, following the assimilation of ammonium by the fungus. However, the pathways responsible for this conversion are largely unknown, though there are several plausible hypotheses. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> net transfer of nutrients to plants requires three transport components: 1) the soil-fungus interface, 2) the fungus-apoplast interface, and 3) the apoplast-root cell interface.|$|E

It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> there have been {{instances}} where sneezing has resulted in the formation of clouds as well. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> Nimbus was not born with this ability. It remains a mystery why such an ability remained dormant until her tween years.|$|R
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{central bank}} buys bonds by simply {{creating}} money—it is not financed in any way. It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system. If {{a central bank}} is to maintain a target interest rate, then it must necessarily buy and sell government bonds {{on the open market}} {{in order to maintain the}} correct amount of reserves in the system.|$|E
25|$|It may be <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Karaite and Rabbanite {{communities}} {{may have}} been theologically at odds, but often maintained good social and economic relations during the 10–13th centuries in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. It was obviously as important for the Karaite grocer {{to do business with}} Rabbanite customers as it was for the latter to be able to rely on the religious acceptability of his products.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{reactive}} species {{generated by the}} radiation can take part in following reactions, {{this is similar to}} the idea of the non-electrochemical reactions which follow the electrochemical event which is observed in cyclic voltammetry when a non-reversible event occurs. For example, the SF5 radical formed by the reaction of solvated electrons and SF6 undergo further reactions which lead to the formation of hydrogen fluoride and sulfuric acid.|$|E
