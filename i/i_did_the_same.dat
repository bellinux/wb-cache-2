500|$|Henry Tizard, whose {{committee}} spearheaded {{development of}} the CH system, grew concerned that CH would be too effective. He expected that the Luftwaffe would suffer so many losses {{that they would be}} forced to call off daylight attacks, and would turn to a night bombing effort. Their predecessors in World War <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> when the London Air Defence Area successfully blocked daytime raids, and attempts to intercept German bombers at night proved comically ineffective. Tizard's concerns would prove prophetic; Bowen called it [...] "one of the best examples of technological forecasting made in the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|Burnley {{explained}} that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, {{though it was}} {{toward the end of}} the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I would say that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... …shortly {{before he}} left he burned all our correspondence, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on his request. In the morning {{before he left}}, I photographed him for the last time. The picture is unhappy just like the {{departure}} itself, because we didn't {{know what he was}} putting himself into… ...|$|E
30|$|If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> task now, <b>I</b> {{would include}} {{modeling}} in my instruction. I would construct a three-dimensional {{shape of a}} protein molecule.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say a rat, rather, George. Don't {{you know}} they are right? Would not <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> if she were my girl, knowing you as I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there you}} are! If you earn fifty cents, an' {{enough to buy}} grub, an' <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> it wouldn't take us but ten days to have the money we wanted." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I {{have done in the}} past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ruck said nothing, but he {{presently}} went in, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry put out all his {{enormous}} strength, and Good and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> with such power as nature had given us.|$|E
60|$|Rho. No; none of these: I'm sure she's young; and, for her humour, she laughs, sings, {{and dances}} eternally; and, which is more, we never quarrel about it, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} that other opponents I shall have to meet may use similar methods, and unless <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> I'll be further handicapped. As it happens, I'm {{carrying}} weight enough already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Laura, {{you know}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ridicule you. You know I love {{you for what}} you are <b>doing.</b> Would not <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and fight for him down to my nails if I had a brother?" ...|$|R
60|$|After the {{conversation}} which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry {{put on his}} hat and prepared to go out. As {{a matter of course}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hiram {{slid forward}} a little, and rose {{cautiously}} to look over. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> When I saw {{the cave and}} the spring-hole I felt a catch in my throat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In a {{short time}} the two men {{described}} by the dervish entered the room, and at a sign from him my sister made room at her side for one, while <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Aunt Jane. 'If we made {{poor little}} Val write her confession, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{for not having}} looked after her better, it will be off our minds, and need not cloud the meeting.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the game}} Destroy All Humans!, {{during the final}} boss battle against Silhouette when you read her mind {{one of the things}} she says is [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>The</b> <b>same</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>do</b> every night. Try and take over the world!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear something," [...] Wulf said. [...] "It {{comes from}} the front. Run round {{to the right and}} bring the sentries from that flank and post them in the {{intervals}} of those in front, while <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on <b>the</b> left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you wont}} stop {{and talk to}} me," [...] he said, [...] "I'll make you. If anybody interferes with me I'll smash him into jelly. It would serve you right if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ruck said nothing, but he {{presently}} went in; whereupon, {{feeling that}} I mustn’t lose him, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> “It {{will be an}} opportunity,” I remarked as cheerfully as possible, “for me to bid good-bye to the ladies.” ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{the lights}} were lowered, and at my {{direction}} Miller placed his right hand on the psychic's left and touched fingers with Mrs. Miller. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> thus connecting the circle. In this way we sat quietly conversing for some time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I feel a {{good bit}} that way myself. Ben is in the army, and so is Gilbert Pennington. If {{they can make a}} record for {{themselves}} why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same?</b> As it was I came close to joining the army with Ben." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How shy {{you are of}} {{speaking}} the new name! 'She' will like it, I assure you, for she makes my friends hers. Sylvia, come here, and tell Adam he is welcome; he dares to doubt it. Come and talk over old times, while <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with Faith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Their dispositions {{are quite}} different," [...] she said, [...] "and knowing them as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> see <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{differences}} in their faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why do {{you talk}} to me about sending her away? I don't send her away. Urmand comes and takes her away. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> when I was young. Now I'm old, and I have to be left behind. It's the way of nature.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Mr. Jaggers did the same. [...] "Now, Wemmick," [...] said the latter then, {{resuming}} his usual manner, [...] "what item {{was it you}} were at when Mr. Pip came in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To see the Great World," [...] replied Old Mr. Toad. [...] "Foolish, very foolish of them, {{but they}} would do it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing myself when I was their age. Couldn't stop me any more than I could stop them. They don't know when they're well off, but young folks never do. Fine weather, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{got to be}} done, Hugh. Tie {{that bit}} of sacking, quick, over your nose and mouth, while <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Now lower {{yourself}} by your arms, and drop; it won't be above fifteen feet. Hold your breath, and rush straight to the window. I heard them open it. Now, both together now." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, of course. I quite understand. <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in her place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't hesitate," [...] the {{midshipman}} said; [...] "but I {{wish the}} fellow {{could make a}} fight of it. However, as he would kill me {{if he had a}} chance, he mustn't grumble if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for him. Now, Ned, you tell me exactly what <b>I</b> am to <b>do,</b> and you may rely on my doing it." ...|$|R
60|$|While he did this, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> at the {{distance}} of near fifty leagues from the shore, being {{the distance}} which I thought the frigate kept in as she stood away from me. We made our cruise both of us very punctually; I found him in the station we agreed on, and we both stood into the road again from whence we came.|$|E
6000|$|I did not grasp his meaning then; {{afterwards}} I was to {{find that}} a great proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. Then his swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift movement--and vanished. The fern fronds he had stood between came swishing together, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I whistled, {{for that}} meant a five-and-forty miles trudge without sleep. Then I called to the men to take each of them as much cooked elephant's meat as he could carry conveniently. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> myself, and forced the woman Maiwa to eat some as we went. This I did with difficulty, for at that time she seemed neither to sleep nor eat nor rest, so {{fiercely}} was she set on vengeance.|$|E
30|$|I {{would add}} {{a review of}} other {{scientific}} studies if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> task now because it may help students to understand the progress in information about buoyancy of liquids. We may also discuss {{the validity of the}} principle of Archimedes. Other studies that are done by other scientists may also give a different point of view.|$|R
60|$|Lucy is to {{be married}} in the autumn, and she is already {{planning}} out her dresses and how her house {{is to be}} arranged. I sympathise with her, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall {{have to try to}} make both ends meet.|$|R
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, <b>I</b> still, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before … <b>I</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things, so … I'm {{the wrong kind of}} person to be really big and famous.|$|R
