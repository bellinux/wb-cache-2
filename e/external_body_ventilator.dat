40|$|Manual and {{mechanical}} exsufflation are important but underutilized ways to clear airway secretions. These methods are especially useful {{when used in}} concert with noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure ventilatory assistance to facilitate extubation and ventilator weaning. This {{can be used as}} much as 24 hours a day as an alternative to tracheostomy ventilation or <b>body</b> <b>ventilator</b> use for patients with paralytic restrictive ventilatory insufficiency. These techniques expedite community management of ventilator assisted individuals by avoiding tracheostomy and need for invasive suctioning and ongoing wound care. For these techniques to be effective and to prevent further suppression of ventilatory drive, supplemental oxygen administration must be avoided unless pO 2 is less than 60 mm Hg despite normalization of pCO 2. Custom molded interfaces for the delivery of noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure ventilatory assistance {{can also be used to}} facilitate the delivery of variable inspiratory expiratory positive airway pressure for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure ventilatory assistance or <b>body</b> <b>ventilator</b> use can rest the respiratory muscles of patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This and pulmonary rehabilitation programs geared to exercise reconditioning are therapeutic options that significantly improve the quality of life of these patients. For both paralytic restrictive and obstructive pulmonary patients, these techniques decrease cost and frequency of hospitalizations...|$|R

40|$|The use of home {{mechanical}} ventilation has increasingly become commonplace {{in the management}} of patients with chronic neuromuscular ventilatory failure. Nu-merous approaches to the application of ventilatory support, both invasive and noninvasive, are currently available. These range from providing standard inva-sive intermittent positive pressure {{mechanical ventilation}} (IPPV) via an indwelling tracheostomy tube to the use of negative pressure <b>body</b> <b>ventilators</b> (NPBVs), inter-mittent abdominal pressure ventilators (IAPVs), rocking beds, and noninvasive IPPV techniques. This paper discusses the technical operation and limitations of current positive pressure ventilators. Additionally, clinical application methodol-ogy in various settings is detailed.

5000|$|Comparing Ontology with Epistemology, Berkeley asked, [...] "But, {{though it}} were {{possible}} that solid, figured, moveable substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet {{how is it possible}} for us to know this?" [...] Knowledge through our senses only gives us knowledge of our senses, not of any unperceived things. Knowledge through reason does not guarantee that there are, necessarily, unperceived objects. In dreams and frenzies, we have ideas that do not correspond to external objects. [...] "…The supposition of <b>external</b> <b>bodies</b> is not necessary for the producing our ideas…." [...] Materialists do not know how bodies affect spirit. We can't suppose that there is matter because we don't know how ideas occur in our minds. [...] "In short, if there were <b>external</b> <b>bodies,</b> it is impossible we should ever come to know it…." [...] Suppose that there were an intelligence that was not affected by <b>external</b> <b>bodies.</b> If that intelligence had orderly and vivid sensations and ideas, what reason would it have to believe that <b>bodies</b> <b>external</b> to the mind were exciting those sensations and ideas? None.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{examples}} represented are not comprehensive for both bound and link nouns, {{they show that}} there is no structural distinction between the two subclasses. Analysis of a Tîrî corpus by Midori Osumi (1995, p. 65) found that there were thirty-three bound nouns referring to <b>external</b> <b>body</b> parts compared to only five link nouns. This indicates that there are semantic differences between subclasses. For example, among the five link nouns is ao- ‘cheek’ {{is the only one that}} refers to <b>external</b> human <b>body</b> parts while others refer to external animal and insect parts (Osumi, 1995, p. 65). This shows that all <b>external</b> human <b>body</b> parts are bound nouns, except for ao- in Tîrî (Osumi, 1995, p. 65).|$|R
40|$|The Newtonian {{mechanics}} of a many-particle system evolving in time {{under the influence}} of an <b>external</b> <b>body</b> potential, that is, an external potential that couples to the center of mass only, is examined. The lack of any other external fields allows the complete separation of the center-of-mass (or external-field-dependent) equations from the internal (or external-field-independent) dynamics. The complete solution of the center-of-mass motion then allows an analytical evaluation of the <b>external</b> <b>body</b> potential contributions to the thermophysical properties of the system. The phenomena of field-induced heating, Taylor-Aris hydrodynamic form for the diffusion tensor, and an analogous hydrodynamic form for the viscosity tensor are derived from microscopic principles. A brief and model-dependent description of equilibrium phenomena is also presented...|$|R
