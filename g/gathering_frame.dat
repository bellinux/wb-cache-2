40|$|Using {{examples}} of incidents that UK Police Forces deal {{with on a}} day-to-day basis, we explore the macrocognition of incident response. Central to our analysis {{is the idea that}} information relating to an incident is translated from negotiated to structured and actionable meaning, in terms of the Community of Practice of the personnel involved in incident response. Through participant observation of, and interviews with, police personnel, we explore the manner in which these different types of meaning shift over the course of incident. In this way, macrocognition relates to <b>gathering,</b> <b>framing</b> and sharing information through the collaborative sensemaking practices of those involved. This involves two cycles of macrocognition, which we see as ‘informal’ (driven by information gathering as the Community of Practice negotiates and actions meaning) and ‘formal’ (driven by the need to assign resources to the response and the need to record incident details). The examples illustrate that these cycles are often intertwined, as are the different forms of meaning, in situation-specific ways that provide adaptive response {{to the demands of the}} incident...|$|R

Now as a community organizer in San Diego with Latino immigrant and African-American communities in recent years, applying an engaged, reflexive anthropological perspective to US social justice organizing models and objectives sheds new light on the political ramifications of familiar practices, such as <b>gathering</b> testimonies, <b>framing</b> an interview, and cutting an actionable issue...|$|R
40|$|Recent spikes in {{international}} food {{prices and the}} occurrence of food riots in the period 2007 – 2008 have led many researchers to investigate more closely the links between rising food prices and conflict or political instability. However, this emerging literature suffers {{from a number of}} shortcomings. The objective {{of this article is to}} analyze these shortcomings further, highlight their theoretical and empirical implications, and offer ways of addressing them. I focus on three main issues. First, I look at the recurring lack of precision in the use of concepts such as political instability and conflict, and in particular the food riot concept itself. Second, I examine the often uncritical data <b>gathering</b> based on <b>framing</b> by media sources without a closer analysis of the events that took place on the ground. And third, I focus on the issue of presupposed and understudied economic as well as political causal mechanisms. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Breast {{compression}} decreases {{radiation dose}} and reduces potential for motion and geometric unsharpness, {{yet there is}} variability in applied compression force within and between some centres. This article explores the problem solving process applied to the application of breast compression force from the mammography practitioners' perspective. Methods: A qualitative analysis was undertaken using an existing full data set of transcribed qualitative data collected in a phenomenological study of mammography practitioner values, behaviours and beliefs. The data emerged from focus groups conducted at six NHS breast screening centres in England (participant n = 41), and semi-structured interviews with mammography educators (n = 6). A researcher followed a thematic content analysis process to extract data related to mammography compression problem solving, developing a series of categories, themes and sub-themes. Emerging themes were then peer-validated by two other researchers, and developed into a model of practice. Results: Seven consecutive stages contributed towards compression force problem solving: assessing the request; first impressions; explanations and consent; handling the breast and positioning; applying compression force; final adjustments; feedback. The model captures information <b>gathering,</b> problem <b>framing,</b> problem solving and decision making which inform an ‘ideal’ compression scenario. Behavioural problem solving, heuristics and intuitive decision making are reflected within this model. Conclusion: The application of compression should no longer be considered as one single task within mammography, but is now recognised as a seven stage problem solving continuum. This continuum model {{is the first to}} be applied to mammography, and is adaptable and transferable to other radiography practice settings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Describing and {{managing}} activities, resources and constraints of software development processes is a challenging goal for many organizations. A {{first generation of}} Software Process Modeling Languages (SPMLs) {{has appeared in the}} nineties but failed to gain broad industrial support. Recently however, a second generation of SPMLs appeared, leveraging the strong industrial interest for modeling languages such as the UML. In this article, we propose a comparison of these UML-based SPMLs. While not exhaustive, this comparison concentrates on SPMLs most representative of the various alternative approaches, ranging from UML-based framework specializations to full-blown executable meta-modeling approaches. To support the comparison of these various approaches, we propose a <b>frame</b> <b>gathering</b> a set of requirements for process modeling, such as semantic richness, modularity, executability, conformity to the UML standard, and formality. Beyond discussing the relative merits of these approaches, we also evaluate the overall suitability of these UML based SPMLs for software process modeling. Finally, we discuss the impact of these approaches on {{the current state of the}} practice, and conclude with lessons we have learned in doing this comparison...|$|R
40|$|Extract] As {{the chapter}} authors in this {{collection}} have demonstrated so inspiringly, whether qualitative researchers used recorded narratives, digital spaces, poetry, photography, performance or fiction, their focus is on <b>gathering</b> rich narratives <b>framed</b> in the narrative owners' meanings. Using arts- based, narrative and participatory processes, this collection features transmission of inspiring life stories; authentic, reflective exploration; community engagement, empathic researcher relationships and transformative social justice aspirations. This collection invites researchers and readers into a shared space where proactive methods demonstrate ways to advance engagement using creative research methods and with diverse communities. Contemporary qualitative researchers, as noted earlier, need {{to engage in a}} – sometimes paradoxical – double act of attempting to amplify everyday narratives in an authentic manner, {{while at the same time}} understanding and revealing to the reader their own role in gathering, interpreting and representing these stories. As noted by Pepper and Wildy (2009, p. 21), most often qualitative researchers deliberately use 'active, first-person voice to explicate the participant's perspective' while deliberately drawing attention to the highly subjective and interpretive nature of their own constructions. It is these multiple narratives that are aimed at readers. However, 'the way writers explicitly bring readers into their texts... have generally received less attention' (Hyland, 2001, p. 550) ...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} system for diatom localization and identification with a modular structure. The main contribution {{of this work}} {{is to provide a}} complete automatic system for the analysis of phytoplanktonic samples in brightfield microscopy. The overall procedure consists in two parts: first, <b>frame</b> <b>gathering</b> at low magnification and second, further analysis at higher mag-nification. At low magnification the goal is to obtain a panoramic overview of the full sample by tiling each frame. Subsequent processing steps will provide the localization and size of each particle in each frame for further analysis. The localization method based on image fusion techniques provides more robust and accurate particle detection than other methods reported in the literature. From the size information we obtain a useful cue about the objective to use. At higher magnification we develo-ped new autofocusing techniques providing a fast and accurate focused image. Because particles present a volumetric struc-ture, we propose the use of multifocus fusion techniques for merging in a single plane the focused parts from neighbouring the best focused image. Then we applied a particle selection analysis {{to reduce the number of}} images to analyze, i. e. to discrimi-nate diatoms from debris. This is the most challenging step, due to large variability of shapes, diatom fragmentation, particle overpopulation and diatom hiding. The latter is not described in the present paper and will be the subject for a forthcoming publication. Finally, for diatom identification we use the scale transform technique and a cepstrum-based cross-correlation technique...|$|R
40|$|Socio-hydrology is {{the science}} of human {{influence}} on hydrology {{and the influence of}} the water cycle on human social systems. This newly emerging discipline inherently involves a historic perspective, often focusing on timescales of several centuries. While data on human history is typically available for this time <b>frame,</b> <b>gathering</b> information on the hydrological situation during such a period can prove difficult: measured hydrological data for such long periods are rare, while models and secondary data sets from geomorphology, pedology or archaeology are typically not accurate enough over such a short time. In {{the first part of this}} study, the use of historic maps in hydrology is reviewed. Major breakthroughs were the acceptance of historic map content as valid data, the use of preserved features for investigating situations earlier than the map, and the onset of digital georeferencing and data integration. Historic maps can be primary quantitative sources of hydro-geomorphological information, they can provide a context for point-based measurements over larger areas, and they can deliver time series for a better understanding of change scenarios. In the second part, a case study is presented: water level fluctuations of Lake Balaton were reconstructed from maps, levelling logs and other documents. An 18 th century map system of the whole 5700 km 2 catchment was georeferenced, integrated with two 19 th century map systems, and wetlands, forests and open water digitized. Changes in wetland area were compared with lake water level changes in a 220 yr time series. Historic maps show that the water level of the lake was closer to present-day levels than expected, and that wetland loss pre-dates drainage of the lake. The present and future role of historic maps is discussed. Historic hydrological data has to be treated with caution: while it is possible to learn form the past, the assumption that future changes will be like past changes does not always hold. Nevertheless, old maps are relatively accessible data sets and the knowledge base for using them is rapidly growing, and it can be expected that long-term time series will be established by integrating georeferenced map systems over large areas. In the Appendix, a step-by-step guide to using historic maps in hydrology is given, starting from finding a map, through georeferencing and processing the map to publication of the results...|$|R
