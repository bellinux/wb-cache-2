5000|$|In modern photography, the {{fill-in light}} {{is used to}} control the {{contrast}} in the scene and is nearly always placed above the lens axis and is a large light source (think of the sky behind your head when taking a photograph). As the amount of light {{is less than the}} <b>key-light</b> (main-light), the fill acts by lifting the shadows only (particularly relevant in digital photography where the noise lives in the shadows). It is true to say that light bounces around a room and fills in the shadows but {{this does not mean that}} a fill-light should be placed opposite a <b>key-light</b> (main-light) and it does not soften shadows, it lifts them. The relative intensity (ratio) of the <b>Key-light</b> to the fill-light is most easily discussed in terms of [...] "Stops" [...] difference (where a Stop is a doubling or halving of the intensity of light). A 2 Stop reduction in intensity for the Fill-Light would be a typical start point to maintain dimensionality (modelling) in a portrait (head and shoulder) shot..|$|E
50|$|Also {{called a}} main light, the key light is usually placed {{to one side}} of the subject's face, between 30 and 60 degrees off center and a bit higher than eye level. The purpose of the <b>Key-Light</b> is to give shape (modelling) to a subject, {{typically}} a face. This relies on the first principle of lighting, white comes out of a plane and black goes back into a plane. The depth of shadow created by the Main-Light can be controlled with a Fill-Light.|$|E
40|$|Four {{groups of}} four pigeons each were studied on two {{different}} multiple schedules. The cues correlated with the schedule components were localized on the response key for two groups and were not localized for the others. Two groups worked on multiple schedules with variable interval 15 -sec in both components, and variable interval 15 -sec in one component and extinction in the other. The other two groups had identical procedures except that food was presented on a response-independent variable-time schedule. Variable-interval birds with localized stimuli showed marked behavioral contrast; variable-interval birds with non-localized stimuli showed no behavioral contrast. Variable-time birds with <b>key-light</b> stimuli acquired high rates of autopecking, which changed as treatment changed {{in a manner that}} paralleled rate changes, resulting in behavioral contrast for variable-interval birds. Variable-time birds with non-localized stimuli key pecked only at a low rate. The findings indicate that behavioral contrast in pigeons may result from the autopecking that is obtained with stimulus-contingent food presentation...|$|E
40|$|A key {{construct}} in Killeen’s (1994) mechanics is {{the short-term}} memory trace. It is asserted that reinforcement strengthens whatever is in STM. On short schedules, {{this includes the}} memory of the consummatory behavior elicited by the prior reinforcer, which undermines high rates on those schedules. This memorial interpretation is tested by evaluating the rates of decay of short-term memory for colored <b>key-lights</b> in a dozen pigeons; those rates are correlated with the (inferred) rates of decay of memory for pecking in the same animals on ratio schedules...|$|R
40|$|Three keys were {{available}} for monkeys to press. The objective was to teach the animals to press the keys in sequences up to 10 members in length. With fading procedures, a light that cued the correct key at a given serial member of the sequence faded out slightly each time the animal selected it, and became slightly brighter after the animal made an error at that sequence member. The correct keys were faded out, starting {{from the end of}} the sequence and proceeding toward the beginning. With control procedures, the cue lights were turned off suddenly, rather than being faded gradually. In almost every instance, the animals learned a longer series of unlighted key positions with the fading procedures than they did when each <b>key-light</b> was turned off suddenly. Also, requiring the animals to press a series of keys cued by lights before they could reach the sequence members they were to learn hampered them in learning the later serial members. By using several different sequences, it was possible to replicate these findings within the individual animal...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} whether or not pigeons could form a conditioned food aversion to the visual properties of food. Prior research has shown that other species will learn to avoid a food the ingestion of which has been paired with sickness. This thesis attempted to expand these results, first by demonstrating the phenomenon in the pigeon, and then by utilizing visual cues present at ingestion but not physically part of the food, and by testing to see if the aversion formed to these visual cues would generalize to other food-related behaviours. [...] In the first study, pigeons consumed pigeon checkers coloured either red or green. Ingestion of one colour of checker was paired with sickness, produced by LiCl injection, while ingestion of the other checkers produced no negative consequences. In a choice test between the two types of checkers, the pigeons strongly preferred the previously safe checkers. [...] In each of the second, third and fourth experiments, pigeons were trained to eat uncoloured pigeon checkers from a white-illuminated food magazine in an operant chamber. On the conditioning day the magazine was illuminated with red light and following consumption, half the birds were injected with LiCl and half were injected with physiological saline, an inert substance. After one such red-illuminated conditioning session, a significant proportion of the LiCl injected birds subsequently decreased consumption of red-illuminated checkers while the saline injected birds maintained or increased their consumption of red-illuminated checkers. The aversion to red-illuminated checkers grew stronger as a function of red-illuminated consumption-sickness pairings in the LiCl injected birds, reaching almost total suppression of red-illuminated consumption after two such pairings. [...] Conditioning of the red-illumination consumption aversion was followed in Experiments 3 and 4 by an autoshaping procedure. In Experiment 3, the <b>key-light</b> to which autoshaping occurred was either red or green and the prediction was that the birds which were averse to red-illumination in the magazine would be slower to autoshape to the red key than those presented with a green key. The autoshaped responding which resulted was so erratic that it was impossible to verify this prediction. In Experiment 4, autoshaping to a yellow <b>key-light</b> was followed by conditioned suppression testing using either red or green key-lights on discrete trials. Again, the level of autoshaped responding made meaningful interpretation of the data impossible...|$|E
40|$|Six hens' key-pecking {{at each of}} two {{simultaneously}} available perspex discs (keys) {{was maintained}} by intermittent access to wheat. Over a series of conditions one of four sounds (music, water-hose, poultry and train), at a range of decibel levels (90 – 100 dB(A)) was relayed to the experimental chamber when pecking was on one key, but not when {{it was on the}} other. The key associated with the sound was reversed twice during each 40 -min session. The reversal was signalled by changing <b>key-light</b> colour. The effect of the sounds on behaviour was assessed by measuring changes in the relative allocation of key pecks between the two keys (one with sound, the other without). A consistent effect of the sound was shown as a bias in both responding and time allocated to the keys. Bias could be seen in the behaviour measures for some sounds, and the biases owing to the presence of sound, were estimated mathematically from the generalized matching law. Generally, these noise biases increased with the increasing intensity of the sound and differed from sound type to sound type. Results showed that the sound of hens in a commerical poultry shed at 100 dB(A) was associated with the most bias and a piece of music at 90 and 95 dB(A) was associated with the least bias. It is argued that the bias measures derived from this procedure provide quantitative estimates of the relative aversiveness of the sounds used. Such measures are important in evaluating environmental features that may affect hen welfare...|$|E
