In this respect, during 2010 - 2011 were collected 12 propolis samples using a propolis collector and 12 samples using the <b>hive</b> <b>tool.</b> Propolis samples were prepared as Ethanolic extracts (1 %, w/v) and analyzed for phenolics composition (total phenolics, flavones/flavonols, flavanones/dihydroflavonols). Wax content was also determined by Soxhlet extraction. The results obtained proved that collection method has great influence over both wax content and quantity of phenolic compounds from propolis. In conclusion propolis gathered by means of a collector has lower amount of wax and higher amount of phenolics than propolis gathered by hive tools...|$|E

40|$|Swarm {{verification}} {{and parallel}} randomised depth-first search are very effective parallel techniques to hunt bugs in large state spaces. In case bugs are absent, however, scalability of the parallelisation is completely lost. In recent work, {{we proposed a}} mechanism to inform the workers which {{parts of the state}} space to explore. This mechanism is compatible with any action-based formalism, where a state space can be represented by a labelled transition system. With this extension, each worker can be strictly bounded to explore {{only a small fraction of}} the state space at a time. In this paper, we present the <b>HIVE</b> <b>tool</b> together with two search algorithms which were added to the LTSmin tool suite to both perform a preprocessing step, and execute a bounded worker search. The new tool is used to coordinate informed swarm explorations, and the two new LTSmin algorithms are employed for preprocessing a model and performing the individual searches.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is to compile the literature available {{to give an}} integrated summary of beekeeping in the Czech Republic and to describe the most serious illnesses of the bees. Such as bee the literature available American foulbrood end varroasis including brief processes {{how they can be}} healed or how to avoid them. The importance of honeybee and its irreplaceable role in the ecosystem of our planet is described in the introduction of this thesis. It is mentioned that honeybee is often perceived only like a food source. In the main part, the Czech beekeeping is divided according to the historical dating into a forest, collecting and rational beekeeping as well as into special type of beekeeping colled,,brtnické''. Then there is a treatise on the formation and the importance of organizations associating Czech beekeepers through years. An additional part {{of the first half of}} the thesis is a summary of recently used <b>hives,</b> <b>tools</b> and also ways of unnatural bee´s feeding. The second half of the main part is pursued to serious illnesses in the Czech Republic. This chapter is divided according to originators of illnesses on illnesses made by physical influences or unsuitable food, bacterial illnesses, fungous, viral and invasive illnesses. American foulbrood and illnesses caused by the mite Varroa destructor has the biggest importance because these illnesses make the biggest losses in the Czech Republic. Every illness has own characteristics, originator, clinical diagnostics and therapeutic possibilities...|$|R
40|$|Essential {{beekeeping}} tools Cue: Ask {{anyone who}} earns {{a living from}} a practical job ? a mechanic, carpenter, plumber or builder ? about the secrets of success, {{and you can be}} fairly certain that having the right tools {{will be one of the}} most important. Without the right tool, a job can take twice as long, and you may end up completely breaking what you are trying to mend. Some people describe beekeeping as almost like an art; it demands specialist knowledge to do it well. It also needs some specialised equipment. This does not have to be expensive, and much of it beekeepers can make themselves, but without it the beekeeper will struggle, and may become both discouraged by failure and stung by bees. Warwick Selzer is an experienced beekeeper from Midrand, a town just north of Johannesburg in South Africa. Lucas Moloi spoke to him about the most important items of beekeeping equipment. Number one, according to Warwick, is the smoker, a tool which beekeepers use to push smoke around and into a hive before they begin their work. Lucas asked him why a smoker is so important. IN:		?A smoker, what it does for a beekeeper ? OUT:		?long as you are not highly allergic. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Warwick Selzer, a beekeeper from Midrand in South Africa. In addition to the advice he gave to Lucas, people who are allergic to bee stings must be extremely careful not to get stung. If possible, they should keep anti-sting drugs with them whenever they go to a place where bees may be found. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Selzer	A smoker, what it does for a beekeeper is it just makes your work with the hive or with the colony that you are working with easier, it calms them done. Because the natural reaction to smoke is that there is a veld fire or a wild fire, and with that they may need to leave their hive. So in that instance they eat as much honey as they can so that if in the event that they need to leave the hive, they can do so and at least have some kind of resources. And with that, what happens is that the bees, because they are so full of honey they struggle to sting. It makes them also a little bit lethargic, they are less likely to fly, less likely to sting you. But what you do not also want to do Lucas is over-smoke. If you over-smoke bees it takes them about a week to ten days to regain their stable environment inside the hive. You lose potentially a week to ten days of efficient harvesting if you over-smoke. Moloi		So can beekeepers make their own smokers? Selzer	Yes they can. It is very possible; all you need is a cylinder, a bellow, you drill a hole within the cylinder, you need a lid for the cylinder to be closed on which will have a funnel leading off of it. The bellow then must be attached to that cylinder. All you need to do then is basically open the lid, put the fuel into the cylinder, light it, let it burn for a while and then once you have got enough of a fire going or enough of the fuel is lit, you close it and then wait about another minute or two and you should be able to puff the bellow and smoke will be produced. Moloi		So what fuel is best to burn in the smoker? Selzer	Pine needles are very good, they are extremely effective, they give off a good smoke, they burn easily as well. Secondly would be horse manure, strangely enough. You can also use oak chips. I also use non marked or non printed cardboard material. Moloi		So are there other tools that could be useful? Selzer	You need to also have what we call a <b>hive</b> <b>tool,</b> it is very similar to a chisel. It has got like a wrench on the one side and then a flat chisel end on the other side. Now this Lucas is used to actually pry open the lid from the hive. To pry that open you need to have quite a strong piece of stainless steel metal which we call this <b>hive</b> <b>tool.</b> You put it in there and give it a hard jerk and then basically it pries it open pretty neatly. Other than that I would say a bucket is probably useful as well for when you are harvesting honey. You take off the honeycomb and empty it into a bucket with a lid, keep the lid on at all times so that bees do not get into the bucket as well. Other than that probably just a light if you are working at night, or a torch and that would be about it. Moloi		What is the best thing to do if bees start to attack you? Selzer	In a case like that the best thing to do is to get indoors, make sure the doors and windows are closed. If you cannot do that, do not jump into a pool or a body of water. That does not work. Bees are clever, they are intelligent insects and what they will do is that they will wait for you because you cannot hold your breath for ever, right? So what happens is as soon as you come up from the water for air they will sting you every time and they are quick. So do not jump into a body of water or a pool. Do not try and spray the bees with water, that does not work either. Get indoors, get into a car, close the windows, close the doors. The other alternative basically Lucas is to run. Bees will follow you probably for a kilometre but no more than, I would say, two kilometres at an extreme. So those are your two options. Moloi		So what is the best treatment for bee stings? Selzer	Once you have been stung vinegar, applying vinegar, even honey itself; if you can get raw honey apply that. A hot shower actually can also assist, especially with the itching. But the way that you remove that sting is also vital. If you try and pinch that sting to take it out, or scratch it, you could in fact inject yourself with more of the poison in the process. So what I would suggest in the case of being stung, is to use a flat item like a ruler, scissors, knife, anything that is flat, where you lie the thing flat against the skin and you scrap along the skin so that you ensure that you are basically breaking off the tip of the sting rather than trying to go for the head of the sting. It is also important to take note when you are stung what area that you have been stung or somebody has been stung in. If you are stung anywhere on the face you are going to have a much more heightened reaction, especially with the eyes and the lips, ears, breathing, that type of thing. If it is in the mouth, even worse. In that instance, doctor immediately, clinic, hospital whatever the case is. Because with the swelling, the reaction is that your mouth and your tongue and even possibly your throat swells up to such an extent that you actually cannot breathe without assistance. If you are stung on the hand or the arms it is not really that important as long as you are not highly allergic. End of track. Making and using smokers and hive tools, and what to do if attacked or stung by bees...|$|E

In the cloud infrastructure we implemented, a Dell server with Intel Xeon E 5 - 2630 1.8  GHz cores and 32 G memory is employed. A virtual cluster consisting of four nodes is then deployed. For each node, two virtual CPU and 4 GB of memory is allocated. In addition, one node is set up as the master machine for Hadoop, while the remainder are used as slaver nodes. In addition, for the Hadoop platform, the 2.5 version is installed. At the same time, the global controller for the data crawler is deployed in the same master machine as Hadoop, while workers are distributed to the slaver nodes. The <b>Hive</b> [36] <b>tool</b> is also implemented in the platform to pre-process raw data samples.|$|R

First, hive weight scale mechanisms are quantitatively analyzed, yielding design improvements to improve accuracy. Second, designs of hive entrances are tested to promote traffic flow, assist ventilation, and exclude pests. Third, recommendations for Indian hive roofs and exteriors are given to keep hives cooler. Fourth, methods to bolster Indian hive standardization and manufacturing quality are suggested to promote larger, more productive colonies. Fifth, designs of <b>hive</b> management <b>tools</b> are prototyped to help encourage scientific beekeeping.

40|$|Paenibacillus larvae is Gram-positive, spore-forming, {{rod-shaped}} bacteria. This pathogen threatens one of {{the most}} considerable worldwide pollinators - the honeybee (Apis mellifera). It is causative agent of bee disease called American foulbrood. Although it affects only bee larvae, preferably {{on the first day of}} its live, it is highly contagious and could quickly destroy whole bee colony. Adult bees are not susceptible to infection, however due to huge spores resilient of P. larvae, they perform the role of main disease vector. Also the careless beekeepers make it easier to spread. Bee diseases are enquired by state veterinary administration, because honeybee is classified as a livestock. If disease evolves to clinic phase, infected bees and <b>hive</b> with all <b>tools</b> must be burned. American foulbrood is {{one of the}} most deleterious bee diseases.

40|$|Cloud {{key-value}} {{stores are}} becoming increasingly more important. Challenging applications, requiring efficient and scalable access to massive data, arise every day. We focus on supporting interval queries (which are prevalent in several data intensive applications, such as temporal querying for temporal analytics), an efficient solution for which is lacking. We contribute a compound interval index structure, comprised of two tiers: (i) the MRSegmentTree (MRST), a key-value representation of the Segment Tree, and (ii) the Endpoints Index (EPI), a column family index that stores information for interval endpoints. In addition to the above, our contributions include: (i) algorithms for efficiently constructing and populating our indices using MapReduce jobs, (ii) techniques for efficient and scalable index maintenance, and (iii) algorithms for processing interval queries. We have implemented all algorithms using HBase and Hadoop, and conducted a detailed performance evaluation. We quantify {{the costs associated with}} the construction of the indices, and evaluate our query processing algorithms using queries on real data sets. We compare the performance of our approach to two alternatives: the native support for interval queries provided in HBase, and the execution of such queries using the <b>Hive</b> query execution <b>tool.</b> Our results show a significant speedup, far outperforming the state of the art...|$|R
