5|$|Wisconsin {{spent nearly}} all of 1947 as a {{training}} ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at Bayonne, New Jersey, and saw visits conducted at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, Wisconsin took United States Naval Academy midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|Goito {{was built}} by the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia shipyard; her keel was laid down in September 1885 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 6 July 1887.

The maneuvers consisted of close-order <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. Later that year, the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser Wilhelm II during a visit to Italy. Italia served as the flagship of the 2nd Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclad , the torpedo cruiser , and four torpedo boats. During the maneuvers, which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Lepanto {{was under}} {{construction}} for nearly 11 years. She was laid {{down at the}} Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando shipyard at Livorno on 4 November 1876, ten months after her sister Italia. She spent nearly six-and-a-half years on the building ways and was not launched until 17 March 1883, two-and-a-half years after Italia. Lepanto was not completed for another four-and-a-half years, her construction finally being finished on 16 August 1887, twenty-two months {{after the completion of}} Italia. After entering service, Lepanto took part in the annual 1888 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclads , , , and , a protected cruiser, four torpedo cruisers, and numerous smaller vessels.

5|$|On 13 October, the {{majority}} of the fleet conducted a sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on 15 October. During 2–5 November, Marlborough participated in a fleet training operation west of the Orkneys. Another such cruise took place during 1–4 December. The typical routine of gunnery <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> squadron exercises occurred in January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, Iron Duke {{and the rest of the}} fleet sailed from Scapa Flow, to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern.|$|E

On the third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour non-contact <b>drills,</b> <b>and</b> held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E
5|$|Saetta {{was built}} at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia (Royal Dockyard in Castellammare di Stabia). She was {{launched}} on 30 May 1887, and was completed on 16 February 1888.

5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, <b>drills,</b> <b>and</b> other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, <b>drills,</b> <b>and</b> stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{encounter}} battle, {{the action}} had been fought between two forces of roughly equal {{size in the}} heavy monsoon rain at close quarters. Both companies had deployed to the high ground at {{around the same time}} in a bid to outflank the other, with the Australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while the Viet Cong had attempted to nullify the Australian tactics by remaining in close contact. Ultimately, the artillery had decided the outcome in favour of the Australians however, and the Viet Cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties. In this way the fighting bore many similarities to the victory twelve months earlier at Long Tan, yet it remained largely unheralded in Australia. Eight Australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions, including Military Crosses to O'Donnell, Ross and Clark, while Sutherland was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. A number of awards were also made to the RAAF pilots and aircrew, including Cox who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Meanwhile, the bravery evident by the Viet Cong during the battle had also made an impression on the Australians, who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and the skilfulness of their battle <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> tactics which they found to be similar to those used by the Australians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Directly after commissioning, Prinzregent Luitpold {{took part}} in the annual autumn maneuvers, which {{followed}} the fleet cruise to Norway. The exercises lasted from 31August to 9September. Unit <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, Prinzregent Luitpold participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship went to Kiel Week that year. Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, St. Louis was the {{location}} of a large ammunition factory and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory. Area factories also produced uniforms and footwear, K-rations, and chemicals and medicines. The uranium used in the Manhattan Project was refined in St. Louis by Mallinckrodt Chemical Company starting in 1942, and several atomic bomb scientists had ties to St. Louis, including Arthur Compton. At the start of the war, many German, Italian, and Japanese St. Louisans were interrogated or arrested, while the FBI investigated charges of sedition in the area. Residents engaged in civil defense <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> supported the war effort with scrap drives and war bond purchases. St. Louis produced several notable soldiers in the war, including Edward O'Hare, who grew up in St. Louis and won the Medal of Honor for combat in the Pacific. St. Louis also was home to Wendell O. Pruitt, an African-American pilot who shot down three enemy aircraft and destroyed multiple ground targets in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E
5|$|She {{returned}} to San Francisco on 10 September 1946, embarked Carrier Air Group 19 flying the Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter. With this complement, Boxer {{began a series}} of peacetime patrols and training missions off the coast of California during a relatively uneventful period during 1947. In spite of manning difficulties brought on by the demobilization of the US military after World War II, Boxer remained active in Pacific readiness drills around the West Coast and Hawaii. In 1948, she conducted a number of short cruises with US Navy Reserve personnel. On 10 March 1948, a North American FJ-1 Fury launched from Boxer, the first such launch of an all-jet aircraft from an American carrier, which allowed subsequent tests of jet aircraft carrier doctrine. For the remainder of 1948 and 1949, she participated in numerous battle <b>drills</b> <b>and</b> acted as a training carrier for jet aircraft pilots.|$|E
