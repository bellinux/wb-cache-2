5000|$|Lastly, {{the quality}} of both {{personnel}} and equipment in the respective armies cannot be ignored. As the Soviets drained their best, most well-trained divisions {{to fight in the}} west, the overall standard of the forces in the east correspondingly diminished, forcing the STAVKA to rely more heavily on its fortified regions in defensive operations. Meanwhile, the Kwantung Army opposite them then constituted [...] "the cream of the entire Japanese armed forces," [...] and was receiving reinforcements by the day. A large proportion of its units were <b>elite</b> <b>Type</b> A divisions, many of which had seen extensive service in China. The quality of the Japanese officer corps was also very high, as many figures who would go on to have notable careers in the Pacific War including Tomoyuki Yamashita (head of the Kwantung Defense Command and later First Area Army), Isamu Yokoyama (1st Division, later 4th Army), Mitsuru Ushijima (11th Division), and Tadamichi Kuribayashi (1st Cavalry Brigade, Mongolia Garrison Army) held commands there. While both sides primarily relied on bolt-action rifles and light automatic weapons as the backbone of the infantry, Japanese artillery often found itself outranged by the heavy Soviet guns at Khalkhin Gol, {{to the point where the}} IJA felt compelled to move their 15 cm howitzers closer to the front in order to bring them to bear, even at the expense of cover. Even though the Japanese managed to disable a considerable number of Soviet guns through counterbattery fire, their lack of range at extreme distances and shortage of ammunition left them at a distinct disadvantage against the Red Army. Tanks presented a mixed picture as well: although the most modern machine available to the Kwantung Army in 1941, the Type 97 Chi-Ha, had thicker armor (up to 33 mm) compared to the Soviet BT and T-26, its low-velocity 57 mm gun common to medium tanks of the era was outmatched by the long-barreled 45 mm weapons mounted on its opposite numbers, while the 37 mm gun used on the Ha-Go and Te-Ke had an effective range of less than a kilometer. In general, while the [...] "handcrafted, beautifully polished" [...] Japanese tanks were more survivable thanks to their diesel engines (the gasoline powerplants used by the Russians were especially fireprone), their lesser numbers meant that each loss was more damaging to the IJA than each destroyed [...] "crudely finished," [...] "expendable" [...] BT or T-26 was to the Red Army. During the only pitched armored engagement at Khalkhin Gol (the Yasuoka Group's attack in July), the Japanese saw 42 out of their 73 tanks disabled whereas the Soviet-Mongol side lost over 77 tanks and 45 armored cars out of the more than 133 and 59 committed, respectively. The balance in the air would have been strongly in favor of the Japanese. Although the most modern fighter in the VVS arsenal available in the Far East, the Polikarpov I-16, was a firm opponent of the Nakajima Ki-27, the majority of planes in-theater were considerably older. Furthermore, the Soviets had no answer to either the Mitsubishi A6M, which had been fighting in China since 1940, or the high-speed Ki-21 bomber, which could fly faster and farther than its contemporary, the SB-2. Japanese pilots were also highly experienced, with IJNAS airmen averaging roughly 700 hours of flight time by late 1941, and IJAAF aviators averaging 500. Many of these fliers had already tasted combat against China or the VVS in previous battles. In comparison, German pilots received about 230 hours of flying time and Soviet pilots even less.|$|E

40|$|A farmers’ {{participatory}} {{survey was}} carried out in the mid-hill and plain (Terai) regions of Nepal to assess the diversity, consumers’ preference for fruit quality and for thus the selection of potential elite clones of pummelo. A wide variation of morphological characters of tree, fruit, leaf and seed was identified from farmers’ information and laboratory analysis. The multivariate analysis of the data produced 5 descrete groups, which were represented by plants from different agro-ecological regions and soil types. The groups differed significantly in yield efficiency, fruit shape and size, pulp, juice, total soluble solids and acid content, seed number, leaf shape and size. The fruit characters, such as yield, size and acid content were found to be affected by environment and genotypes whereas other characters such as fruit shape, pulp colour, seed number, bitterness, leaf shape and petiole wing shape were not affected by environment. Farmers were more sensitive to quality than to yield. Six <b>elite</b> <b>types</b> were identified from farmers’ participatory survey and laboratory analysis and among them farmers considered four to be the best types for their respective localities.

40|$|Emergy {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} three municipalities (Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure and Rapallo) of the Liguria Region coast, where tourism and cruise tourism are thriving. The results were compared with traditional economic indices. The territorial assessment of the municipalities was analysed by comparing the environmental costs with the economic benefits, focusing on tourism and cruise tourism. Similarities and differences among the case studies emerged. The three economies resulted as being driven by the tertiary sector, but consequences from the different development strategies came to light. Portofino has developed an <b>elite</b> <b>type</b> of tourism with greater attention devoted to the environment. This is mirrored by a sort of safeguarding of tourism and natural resources and by {{the detriment of the}} productive sector's success, on the contrary, in Rapallo. Santa Margherita lies in a boundary condition. The cruise tourism sector was analysed in these contexts. The ecological and economic impacts of the cruise sector were revealed to be significant only in Portofino, being less than 1 % in Rapallo and Santa Margherita Ligure. The load imposed on the local environment by cruise ship tourism was calculated, and Portofino showed a limited condition, while Santa Margherita Ligure and Rapallo exceeded the local carrying capacity. This is due to the different management approaches pursued: only in Portofino is the territory more able to absorb the impact, although the limit is currently reached. As a consequence it appears to be evident that such phenomena as cruise tourism, albeit economically promising in the short term, should be managed with a long-term perspective, integrating them into the local context and setting up strategies for impact reduction or mitigatio...|$|E

40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is {{the sixth}} most {{important}} grain crop worldwide. In addition to grain varieties, diversifying selection in sorghum breeding has produced <b>elite</b> <b>types</b> for forage, silage, sugar, syrup, fiber, and broom production. Sorghum, however, {{has yet to}} undergo selection for whole plant energy production. Recent initiatives and improvements in grain, stem sugar, and lignocellulosic ethanol suggest that all plant parts may be valuable for energy production in the future. The primary focus of this dissertation {{was to understand the}} genetics of tradeoffs in yield and composition of grain, stem sugar and lignocellulosic biomass, and identify genetic diversity in grain and sweet sorghum types. 	A biparental recombinant inbred line population, derived from a cross between a sweet and a grain sorghum, was used to identify QTL for non-structural carbohydrates in the first study and structural carbohydrates in the second. Including both studies, a total of 303 QTL were identified across 69 reported traits. From these studies, a major finding was that tradeoffs are minimal between carbohydrates under favorable conditions. This supports a sink limited model of whole plant energy production. Identified tradeoffs co-localized with QTL for height, flowering time and stand density suggesting some pleiotropic effects. Another important finding in the second study was that the genetic control of structural composition was found to be different between stem and leaf tissue. This was also true for protein, with QTL for grain, stem and leaf crude protein failing to co-localize. These results suggest independent selection on tissues would be most effective. Additional products of these first two studies were a genetic map and NIRS equations for grain, stem and leaf tissue. 	The third study used a diverse panel of 125 sweet, grain and landrace sorghums to examine genetic relationships within the sweet sorghums and between sweet and grain sorghums. Using principal coordinate analysis, three main populations within sweet sorghum were identified, syrup types, sugar and energy types, and amber types. These had some correspondence with grain races kafir, bicolor and caudatum. Association mapping detected four major height QTL, and one QTL for brix...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} the mixed economy for medical services in Herefordshire between 1770 and 1850. Medical services were {{an integral part}} of wider systems of welfare and were provided within a mixed economy that included private practice, state provision, philanthropic activities and mutual societies. Significant resources were spent within the sector and influence over their deployment was of direct interest to parishes, the municipal council, magistrates, philanthropists and individual members of the <b>elite.</b> Four <b>types</b> of medical services are reviewed. These are the provision of personal care by medical practitioners in the private, public and charitable sectors, the establishment of Hereford General Infirmary, changes in institutional services for the insane and developments in public health. Two underlying themes are discussed throughout the thesis. The first of these is the complexity of the mixed economy for medical services. Important changes over the period are identified and the interrelationships between the various sectors investigated. The dominance of public, private or charitable provision shifted in the period as a result of both national and local factors. The second theme explored is the interplay between politics and the systems and institutions providing medical services. The importance of political considerations in shaping local policy towards medical services is demonstrated through detailed case studies. These include examining the link between the launch of the subscription appeal for Hereford Infirmary and the parliamentary election campaign in 1774, approaches taken towards the management of the cholera epidemic of 1832 and the campaign to establish a public lunatic asylum in the late 1830 s.
