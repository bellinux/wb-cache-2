Desert ants, for instance, spend up to 75 % of their foraging time cooling down on elevated thermal refuges such as grass stalks [1]. Ball-rolling dung beetles work under similar thermal conditions in South African savannahs. After landing at a fresh dung pile, a beetle quickly forms a dung ball and rolls it away in a straight line, head down, walking backwards [2]. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} some dung beetles maintain an elevated body temperature to gain a competitive advantage [3], [4] and [5], and that heat shunting may prevent overheating during flight [6] and [7]. However, we know little about the behavioural strategies beetles might employ to mitigate heat stress while rolling their dung balls. Using infrared thermography and behavioural experiments, we show here that dung beetles use their dung ball as a mobile thermal refuge onto which they climb to cool down while rolling across <b>hot</b> <b>soil.</b> We further demonstrate that the moist ball functions not only as a portable platform, but also as a heat sink, which effectively cools the beetle as it rolls or climbs onto it...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} period of quiescence, the Solfatara volcano, 1 km far from Pozzuoli, {{releases}} 1500 t d- 1 of hydrothermal CO 2 through soil diffuse degassing from {{a relatively small}} area (0. 5 km 2). This amount of gas is comparable to that released by crater plume emissions of many active volcanoes. On {{the basis of the}} CO 2 /H 2 O ratio measured in high-temperature fumaroles inside the degassing area, we computed a total thermal energy flux of 1. 19 X 1 E+ 13 J d- 1 (138 MW). Most of this energy is lost by shallow steam condensation and transferred to the atmosphere through the <b>hot</b> <b>soil</b> of the degassing area. The thermal energy released by diffuse degassing at Solfatara is by far the main way of energy release from the whole Campi Flegrei caldera. It is 1 order of magnitude higher than the conductive heat flux through the entire caldera, and, during the last 20 years, it was several times higher than the energy associated with seismic crises and ground deformation events. It is possible that changes in the energy flux from a magma body seated underneath Solfatara andlor argillification processes at relatively shallow depths determine pressurization events in the hydrothermal system and consequenly ground deformation and shallow seismic swarms, as recorded during the recent episodes of volcanic unrest centered at Pozzuoli...|$|E
40|$|Tramway Ridge, {{located near}} the summit of Mount Erebus in Antarctica, is {{probably}} the most remote geothermal soil habitat on Earth. Steam fumaroles maintain moist, <b>hot</b> <b>soil</b> environments creating extreme local physicochemical differentials. In this study a culture-independent approach combining automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and a 16 S rRNA gene library was used to characterize soil microbial (Bacterial and Archaeal) diversity along intense physicochemical gradients. Statistical analysis of ARISA data showed a clear delineation between bacterial community structure at sites close to fumaroles and all other sites. Temperature and pH were identified as the primary drivers of this demarcation. A clone library constructed from a high-temperature site led to the identification of 18 novel bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). All 16 S rRNA gene sequences were deep branching and distantly (85 – 93 %) related to other environmental clones. Five of the signatures branched with an unknown group between candidate division OP 10 and Chloroflexi. Within this clade, sequence similarity was low, suggesting it contains several yet-to-be described bacterial groups. Five archaeal OTUs were obtained and exhibited high levels of sequence similarity (95 – 97 %) with Crenarchaeota sourced from deep-subsurface environments on two distant continents. The novel bacterial assemblage coupled with the unique archaeal affinities reinvigorates the hypotheses that Tramway Ridge organisms are relics of archaic microbial lineages specifically adapted to survive in this harsh environment and that this site may provide a portal to the deep-subsurface biosphere...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{temperatures}} of tropical soils at planting time, where sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) {{is a traditional}} crop, can exceed 50 oC for hours. Seedling heat tolerance is critical for adequate crop establishment in the semi-arid tropics. Improvement of seedlings heat tolerant genotypes would reduce crop losses due to sufficient plant populations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate seedling tolerance to heat, determine individual parental contribution and estimate additive, dominance and epistatic effects for seedling tolerance. In our experi-ments, seedling heat tolerance termed heat tolerance index (HTI) was defined as a ratio of resumed coleoptile growth after a controlled heat shock, compared to normal growth. Genetic parameters of HTI were determined by crossing four lines with varying HTI, with three tester lines, and deriving F 1, F 2, F 3, BC 1 and BC 11 families for generation means analysis. Line IS 20969 from Egypt showed the highest HTI of 0. 71, while 290 R, an experimen-tal line from the University of Nebraska was the lowest at 0. 51. Additive and dominance effects contributed to coleoptile elongation under normal conditions, but only additive effects were significant in recovery growth. Epistatic effects were present in both conditions. General combining ability (GCA) effects for HTI were highly significant in both conditions, but specific combining ability effects were negligible. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} improve seedling heat tolerance and, thus, improve sorghum variety and hybrid plant populations in tropical areas where <b>hot</b> <b>soil</b> temperatures occur...|$|E
40|$|The first {{measurements}} of volcanic/hydrothermal water vapor and heat flux using eddy covariance (EC) {{were made at}} Solfatara crater, Italy, June 8 – 25, 2001. Deployment at six different locations within the crater allowed areas of focused gas venting to be variably included in the measured flux. Turbulent (EC) fluxes of water vapor varied between 680 and 11200 g H 2 O m− 2 d− 1. Heat fluxes varied diurnally with the solar input, and the volcanic component of sensible heat ranged from ∼ 25 to 238 W m− 2. The highest {{measurements of}} both sensible and latent heat flux were made downwind of <b>hot</b> <b>soil</b> regions and degassing pools and during mid-day. The ratio of average volcanic heat (both latent and sensible) to CO 2 flux resulted in an equivalent H 2 O/CO 2 flux ratio of 2. 2 by weight, which reflects the deep source H 2 O/CO 2 gas ratio. The amount latent heat flux/evaporation {{was determined to be}} consistent both with what would be expected from the magnitude of CO 2 fluxes and the fumarolic H 2 O/CO 2 ratio, as well as with observed surface temperatures and wind speeds given a moist soil. This suggests that the water vapor that condenses in the shallow subsurface is remobilized at the soil–atmosphere interface through variable evaporation dependent on the deep heat flux and surface temperature. The results suggest that EC provides a quick and easy method to monitor average H 2 O/CO 2 ratios continuously in volcanic regions, providing another important tool for volcanic hazards monitoring...|$|E

The monitoring periods were 14 October- 14 November 1992, 20 October- 15 November 1993, 16 August- 3 November 1994, and 17 February- 27 February 1995. Pairs of high volume air samplers were located at each of four locations of the process stream: the "spoils pile" that was the feedstock, the "plant area" near the <b>hot</b> <b>soil</b> gate of the sorter, the "clean pile" conveyer area where sorted clean soil was moved, and the "oversize soil" crushing area. These locations were monitored only during the working hours, while air monitoring was also done at an upwind, "background" area 24 -hours per day. The median concentrations of Pu in "workplace" air (combined spoils pile, plant area, and clean pile sites) in 1992 was 397 aCi/m{sup 3 } (15 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }), but increased to median values of 23000 aCi/m{sup 3 } (852 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }) in August-November 1994 and 29800 aCi/m{sup 3 } (1100 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }) in February 1995.

40|$|The {{north-western}} {{sector of}} Caviahue caldera (Argentina), {{close to the}} active volcanic system of Copahue, {{is characterized by the}} presence of several hydrothermal sites that host numerous fumarolic emissions, anomalous soil diffuse degassing of CO 2 and <b>hot</b> <b>soils.</b> In March 2014, measurements of soil CO 2 fluxes in 5 of these sites (namely, Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I, Las Maquinitas II, Anfiteatro, and Termas de Copahue) allowed an estimation that ~ 165 t of deeply derived CO 2 is daily released. The gas source is likely related to a relatively shallow geothermal reservoir containing a single vapor phase as also suggested by both the geochemical data from the 3 deep wells drilled in the 1980 s and gas geoindicators applied to the fumarolic discharges. Gas equilibria within the H-C-O gas system indicate the presence of a large, probably unique, single phase vapor zone at 200 - 210 °C feeding the hydrothermal manifestations of Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I and II and Termas de Copahue. A natural thermal release of 107 MW was computed by using CO 2 as a tracer of the original vapor phase. The magmatic signature of the incondensable fumarolic gases, the wide expanse of the hydrothermal areas and the remarkable high amount of gas and heat released by fluid expulsion seem to be compatible with an active magmatic intrusion beneath this portion of the Caviahue caldera...|$|R
40|$|Microbes in <b>hot</b> desert <b>soil</b> {{partake in}} core {{ecosystem}} processes e. g., biogeochemical cycling of carbon. Nevertheless, {{there is still}} a fundamental lack of insights regarding short-term (i. e., over a 24 -hour [diel] cycle) microbial responses to highly fluctuating microenvironmental parameters like temperature and humidity. To address this, we employed T-RFLP fingerprinting and 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA-derived cDNA to characterize potentially active bacteria in Namib Desert soil over multiple diel cycles. Strikingly, we found that significant shifts in active bacterial groups could occur over a single 24 -hour period. For instance, members of the predominant Actinobacteria phyla exhibited a significant reduction in relative activity from morning to night, whereas many Proteobacterial groups displayed an opposite trend. Contrary to our leading hypothesis, environmental parameters could only account for 10. 5 % of the recorded total variation. Potential biotic associations shown through co-occurrence networks indicated that non-random inter- and intra-phyla associations were ‘time-of-day-dependent’ which may constitute a key feature of this system. Notably, many cyanobacterial groups were positioned outside and/or between highly interconnected bacterial associations (modules); possibly acting as inter-module ‘hubs’ orchestrating interactions between important functional consortia. Overall, these results provide empirical evidence that bacterial communities in <b>hot</b> desert <b>soils</b> exhibit complex and diel-dependent inter-community associations.

40|$|Many rainfed wheat {{production}} systems are reliant on stored soil water for {{some or all}} of their water inputs. Selection and breeding for root traits could result in a yield benefit; however, breeding for root traits has traditionally been avoided due to the difficulty of phenotyping mature root systems, limited understanding of root system development and function, and the strong influence of environmental conditions on the phenotype of the mature root system. This paper outlines an international field selection program for beneficial root traits at maturity using soil coring in India and Australia. In the rainfed areas of India, wheat is sown {{at the end of the}} monsoon into <b>hot</b> <b>soils</b> with a quickly receding soil water profile; in season water inputs are minimal. We hypothesised that wheat selected and bred for high yield under these conditions would have deep, vigorous root systems, allowing them to access and utilise the stored soil water at depth around anthesis and grain-filling when surface layers were dry. The Indian trials resulted in 49 lines being sent to Australia for phenotyping. These lines were ranked against 41 high yielding Australian lines. Variation was observed for deep root traits e. g. in eastern Australia in 2012, maximum depth ranged from 118. 8 to 146. 3 cm. There was significant variation for root traits between sites and years, however, several Indian genotypes were identified that consistently ranked highly across sites and years for deep rooting traits...|$|R

The experiment was initiated to detect and quantify temperature changes of the shallow thermal structure of a quiescent volcano such as Solfatara over long periods.

A geometric correction of the images was necessary to remove the effects of slow movement of the camera. After a suitable correction the images give a reliable and detailed picture of the temperature changes, over the period October 2004 – January 2007, which suggests origin of the changes were linked to anthropogenic activity, vegetation growth and to the increase of the flux of hydrothermal fluids {{in the area of the}} hottest fumaroles. Two positive temperature anomalies were registered after the occurrence of two seismic swarms which affected the hydrothermal system of Solfatara in October 2005 and October 2006.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} manuka growing in five {{different}} habitats was analysed to establish {{whether or not}} different anatomical forms exist. The study involved {{the use of the}} light microscope for obtaining vessel and fibre quantitative data such as their length, width, wall thickness, density of vessel elements in a transection and average grouping of vessels. The confocal microscope was used to measure the area of perforation plates of fibriform vessels and wide vessels. The study also involved the use of the scanning electron microscope for determining the presence of cell wall sculpturing in the walls of wide vessels. The data was analysed by univariate analysis to determine any variation of wood characters within a population and between populations in the five habitats. The habitats were margins of lowland forests, swamp, sand dune, subalpine and <b>hot</b> thermal <b>soils.</b> The study has established variations within each population in all the cell types. The study showed that plants differed anatomically in the average sizes of their cell length, width, wall thickness, abundance of vessels, area of perforation plates and the average grouping and the type of grouping of vessels. There was also variation of wood anatomy between populations in most cell characters except for the length of wide vessels, length of fibriform vessels and wall thickness of fibre-tracheids. In these characters the wood anatomy of manuka was more homogeneous. The significant trends were that margins of lowland forests had wide and thick walled cells in all the cell types and also had high average group of vessels and large area of perforation plates of fibriform vessels and small area of perforation plates for wide vessels. It had short libriform fibres and fibre-tracheids. The swamp habitat seemed to follow margins of lowland forests except that it had the longest fibre-tracheids and libriform fibres and had the greatest area of perforation plates for wide vessels. Both of these habitats had the lowest density of wide vessels. Sand dune, <b>hot</b> thermal <b>soils</b> and subalpine habitats had on average the smallest vessels in terms of diameter and wall thickness and area of perforation plates, but had high abundance or density of wide vessels. Sand dune had wide and thick walled libriform fibres like margins of lowland forests. Subalpine and <b>hot</b> thermal <b>soils</b> had comparatively small fibres in all dimensions. Even though variations were established in most of the cell characters, the correlation of wood with ecology was less pronounced as compared to that found in families and genera in past research. Significant trends were manifest in diameter, wall thickness and density of wide vessels. The margins of lowland forests and swamp (more mesic habitats) had great diameter and cell wall thickness. They also had low density of cells. The other habitats, sand dune, subalpine and <b>hot</b> thermal <b>soils</b> (less mesic habitats) had comparatively narrow diameter of wide vessels, thin cell walls and high levels of wide vessels densities. It was found that the other characters such as length, width, wall thickness of fibriform vessels, libriform fibres, and fibre-tracheids, grouping and area of perforation plates of wide vessels showed complex and overlapping ranges between the habitats and had no significant correlation with ecology. From this research it is clear that general trends of ecological adaptation were evident and also that manuka has its own specific ecological trends...|$|R
