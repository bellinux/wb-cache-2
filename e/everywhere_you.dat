People still talk of his hundred in Melbourne on his first tour, and his highest first-class score, 307 at Adelaide. Six times he toured, being good enough at 20 and good enough at 40.|$|E
25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. You should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

500|$|As {{was common}} in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial {{segregation}} under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation. Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient. [...] They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, {{one of which was}} white-owned. [...] The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures. Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place. [...] In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that {{when she was a child}} there, that [...] "Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted.

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see <b>everywhere.</b> <b>You</b> can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About <b>everywhere</b> <b>you</b> go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the heels}} of 1984's presidential campaign, the rock group Supertramp {{featured}} spoken voice-overs from both Reagan and Bush on the right audio channel and their Democratic opponents Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro on the left audio channel durning the fade-out for their song [...] "Better Days". The song's video reviews the 20th century through a retrospective montage of its hardships and the leaders who promised solution. Beginning with the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} the Third Reich, the video sequences clips of military parades and battles moving forward to atomic test and other advancements in weapons technology, to footage of President Nixon, and then Reagan as his voice can be heard saying, [...] "Our nation is poised...for greatness." [...] In a similar vein, the last minute of Def Leppard's [...] "God's of War" [...] is layered with soundbites of Reagan, Thatcher and the noises of missile launches and bombs exploding. In a departure from Cold War rhetoric, the two leaders' quotes are lifted from their justifications for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and Britain's participation in the affair. Reagan's quotes serve as precursory marks to the War of Terror that the U.S. would lead against majority Muslim countries in the following decades. He can be heard on the track saying, [...] "A message to terrorists <b>everywhere.</b> <b>You</b> can run...but you can't hide", and, [...] "We are not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states", ending with, [...] "They counted on America to be passive...They counted wrong," [...] in contrast to Def Leppard's anti-war lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough {{said that}} Sellers [...] "had the genius {{comparable}} to Chaplin", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as [...] "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts {{he gave to}} the world. For them, he is assured of {{a place in the}} history of art as entertainment." [...] Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that [...] "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything". Director Blake Edwards thought that [...] "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said [...] "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, [...] "Anything to avoid paying for dinner". Secombe later declared to journalists [...] "Bluebottle is deaded now". Milligan later said that [...] "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time." [...] The Daily Mail described Sellers as [...] "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a [...] "flawed genius" [...] who, once he latched on to a comic idea, [...] "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".|$|E
