5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of <b>horticultural</b> <b>products.</b> Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
25|$|Canaanite civilization was a {{response}} to long periods of stable climate interrupted by short periods of climate change. During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East—Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia), the Hittites, and Minoan Crete—to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in Canaanite mythology by the struggle between the storm god, variously called Teshub (Hurrian) or Ba'al Hadad (Semitic Amorite/Aramean) and Ya'a, Yaw, Yahu or Yam, god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local <b>horticultural</b> <b>products,</b> along with commercial growing of olives, grapes for wine, and pistachios, surrounded by extensive grain cropping, predominantly wheat and barley. Harvest in early summer was a season when transhumance nomadism was practiced—shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the Gezer calendar and in the biblical cycle of the year.|$|E

40|$|Seeing the {{phenomena}} of damaging horticulture product import, the people question the government’s rule. Is it useless deem? Or {{is it in}} line with benefit? The reason of those phenomena is the Rule of the Trade Minister Article 30 Number 16 /M-Dag/ 2013 Concerning Provisions Of <b>Horticultural</b> <b>Product</b> Import. The fresh product will be damaged if it againts the condition of label and package, and import approval. Meanwhile proccessed product will be re-exported if it againts the same rule. Therefore the author is encouraged to analiyse this rule—damaging horticulture product import—by the ‘soul’ of Islamic law, mashlahah. For that reason, {{the purpose of this}} research is to know import conditions based on Rule of the Trade Minister Number 16 /M-Dag/ 2013 Concerning Provisions Of <b>Horticultural</b> <b>Product</b> Import and deem this rule by mashlahah analysis.

Therefore the products which contravense this rule is unqualified product.

30|$|Using {{agricultural}} wastes as peat substitute can benefit the waste producers, growers and the environment. Agricultural waste producers can transform the liability of waste disposal into {{a source of}} income by marketing their waste as a valuable <b>horticultural</b> <b>product</b> (Raviv 2005). Local {{agricultural wastes}} are generally less expensive for growers than peat (Raviv 2005; Restrepo et al. 2013), which is produced in cold, northern regions and must be shipped long distances to more temperate horticultural areas (Roberston 1993). Growers who use agricultural wastes as peat substitutes can market their plants as sustainable and command a higher price. Replacing peat with agricultural wastes is environmentally sound because nutrients from wastes can be recycled into plant growth thus reducing fertilizer needs and environmental impacts of peat production can be reduced by reducing the demand for peat.|$|R

The results showed that soaking treatment using solution of sodium metabisulphite prior to drying process was able to maintain the dried celery leaves qualities, which resulted in higher chlorophyll content, lower apparent density, higher rehydration ratio, and higher VRS (volatile reducing substance) in comparison without soaking treatment. Moreover chlorophyll content, apparent density, volatile reducing substance (VRS), and rehydration behaviours were affected by the drying temperature.
