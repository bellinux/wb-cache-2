40|$|It’s {{well known}} that {{thin-walled}} elastic theory represents an important simplified model to analyze various actual structures. Particularly, this model can be applied with good results {{to the analysis of}} ships with large <b>deck</b> <b>openings,</b> subjected to non-uniform torsion, whose distinctive feature is that they may undergo considerable warping deformations. In this paper the problem of the elastic equilibrium of a thin-walled beam is discussed from the beginning, assuming the fundamental hypothesis of Kollbrunner and Hajdin, 1972, {{based on the assumption that}} the longitudinal distribution of the warping deformations is an arbitrary function independent of the unit twist angle. Furthermore the effective longitudinal distribution of the applied torque is taken into due consideration to determine the longitudinal distribution of the warping function and the unit twist angle, in the hypothesis of restrained torsion.

40|$|AbstractPresenting the {{composite}} deck, {{which consists of}} concrete slab with profiled steel sheets fixed to {{the top layer of}} Double Layer Grid (DLG), proved its great efficiency in increasing the load carrying capacity for this type of structures. Earlier studies concluded that the application of the prescribed composite action had solved many problems facing the spread of DLG structures such as their prone to collapse in a progressive manner besides their suitability to be used only as roof covering structures. In addition, the application of {{the composite}} action introduced an economical solution due to considerable savings in steel material used in building the top layer of the DLG structures. However, openings in the deck are needed for architectural purposes such as passing service ducts, day-lighting panels or passing shear walls or continuous structural elements. Adding such openings in the deck affects the efficiency of the composite deck in carrying the assigned loads especially if the openings are being added after the construction is completed. The current research introduced experimental tests along with numerical investigation using ABAQUS software for composite deck space trusses with common cases of support patterns and different <b>deck</b> <b>opening</b> locations.

The effect of torsional moment on the ultimate strength of ship hull subjected to design vertical shear force was also determined. Full hull between the bulkheads was modeled with fully restrained warping displacement at the unloaded end. When pure torsion is applied, the hull corner regions are typically the most highly stressed areas, which may collapse.

The local effect due to the different space topologies such as cabins, public spaces, technical and machinery areas has been taken into account. The transversal beams, longitudinal girders, stiffeners and pillars as supported structural elements are considered in the vibration local response.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} assessing fatigue damage of ship structures assumes moderate wave amplitudes and linear responses. This method can be questioned when applied on container ships which {{are characterized by}} large <b>deck</b> <b>openings</b> that cause low torsion rigidity of the structure. Depending on the heading of the vessel in relation to wave encounter direction, container ships can therefore be sensitive to, for example, oblique waves. In the current investigation, the SESAM software with the three-dimensional hydrodynamic code WASIM is used to simulate a 4400 TEU container ship operating in the North Atlantic. Nonlinear wave loads are utilized for direct calculation of stress histories under severe sea states using the finite element software in SESAM. A method for the separation of normal stress components in an arbitrary cross section and location of the ship is proposed: warping stress from wave-induced torsion, and stress components from horizontal and vertical bending. The strain (stress) response calculated using the models in one location is verified against full-scale measurements made on a similar type of container vessel in the same location. A case study is presented for fatigue damage assessment in two cross sections of the container ship.

40|$|Very large {{container}} ships are rather fl exible {{due to the}} large <b>deck</b> <b>openings.</b> Therefore, hydroelastic stress analysis is required {{as a basis for}} a reliable structural design. In the early design stage, the coupling of the beam model with a 3 D hydrodynamic model is rational and preferable. The calculation is performed using the modal superposition method, so natural hull modes have to be determined in a reliable way. Therefore, the advanced thin-walled girder theory, which takes the infl uence of shear on both bending and torsion into account, is applied for calculating the hull fl exural and torsional stiffness properties. A characteristic of very {{large container}} ships is the quite short engine room, whose closed structure behaves as an open hold structure with increased torsional stiffness due to the deck effect. The paper deals with the calculation of its effective torsional stiffness parameters by utilizing the energy balance approach. Also, estimation of distortion of transverse bulkheads, as a result of torsion and warping, is given. The procedure is checked by the 3 D FEM analysis of a ship-like pontoon. Such a modifi ed beam model of the engine room structure can be included in the general beam model of a ship hull for the need of hydroelastic analysis, where only a few fi rst natural frequencies and mode shapes are required. For practical use in the preliminary design stage of ship structures, the simplicity of the beam model presents an advantage over 3 D FEM models...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{prediction}} of ships {{is always a}} challenge. For container ships, that which, by default, are sensitive to fatigue because of their large <b>deck</b> <b>openings</b> and because of their operating in the extreme conditions of the North Atlantic, this prediction is even harder to make. Further studies are trying {{to establish a new}} method that can predict possible material failure in a more effective way. This study aims at performing stochastic fatigue analyses using a finite element model of a 4, 400 TEU container ship according to the procedure of DNV software SESAM. These analyses could become a basis for the comparison of results between the standard method of fatigue prediction and a new simplified method. The analysis contains frequency domain hydrodynamic simulation, linear elastic structural analysis and stochastic fatigue analysis. The finite element (FE) model of the entire ship indicated several regions where severe fatigue damage is expected. One of these areas was chosen to be represented by a more detailed FE model. The bilge in the midship region was considered most critical because being under the waterline level, cracks are not easily noticed. This local submodel indicated that the highest fatigue damage is located at the connection of transverse web frames with the double side. A detailed FE model represents the double side with a transverse web frame and cut-outs for longitudinal stiffeners. From this analysis, the largest damage is expected at the cut-outs. The hotspot method, according to DNV recommendations, was used to obtain stress concentration factors at two points, which are then applied to the fatigue analysis of the global FE model of the entire ship. The stochastic fatigue analysis of the detailed FE model gives unrealistically high fatigue damage for some local areas. The assumptions and limitations {{of this study suggest that}} the resulting fatigue damage will be overestimated, although they cannot explain this extent of overestimation. Stress concentration factors and SN-curves are therefore examined as for how modifications in their values affect the results...|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high rates of}} bulk carrier casualties in recent years, as well as structural features such as large <b>deck</b> <b>openings,</b> make this vessel type a suitable example for investigating the influence of hydroelastic modelling on predicting wave-induced loads and responses. Two- and three-dimensional fluid–flexible structure interaction models, due to their different degree of complexity and associated data requirements, can be used {{at different stages of}} the design process when estimating wave-induced loads, namely preliminary and detailed design stages, respectively. In this paper, therefore, two- and three-dimensional hydroelasticity theories are applied to predict and compare the dynamic behaviour of a bulk carrier hull, based on OBO MV Derbyshire, in waves. Both symmetric and antisymmetric motions and distortions are incorporated in these investigations. The three-dimensional structural model consists entirely of shell finite elements, representing all major external and internal structural components, whilst the two-dimensional model is generated using Timoshenko beam finite element and finite difference discretisations. Issues relevant to the structural modelling stage, for both idealisations, are discussed. The in vacuo dynamic characteristics are compared for all models, with particular emphasis on the influence of hatch openings, shear centre and warping on the antisymmetric dynamics of the structure. For the wet analysis the fluid–flexible structure interaction is carried out using two-dimensional (Timoshenko beam and strip theory) and three-dimensional (beam and shell finite element idealisations combined with potential flow analysis based on pulsating source distribution over the mean wetted surface) analyses. Comparisons are made between steady-state responses predicted by two- and three-dimensional models in bow quartering regular waves. It is shown that whereas the predicted symmetric dynamic responses obtained from two- and three-dimensional models are in good agreement, differences are observed for the antisymmetric dynamic characteristics. It is thought that {{this may be due to}} inadequacies in the beam models employed when simulating the global dynamic behaviour of this highly non-prismatic hull girder whilst allowing for the effects of warping...|$|R

40|$|Container {{ships and}} their rules for fatigue design are {{in several ways}} {{different}} compared {{with other types of}} commercial ships such as tankers and bulk carriers. For example, most modern container ships have a pronounced bow flare and an overhang stern. This unique hull form, in combination with high service speed, gives rise to large ship motions that require nonlinearity in wave loads must be taken into account. Another important characteristic of container ships is that the U-shaped cross sections due to the large <b>deck</b> <b>openings</b> make the ship structure sensitive to wave-induced torsion, especially in high waves. A consequence of the open cross section is low torsion rigidity of the ship hull, which, together with the high service speed and large ship motions, demands new stricter requirements for fatigue design of the future container ships. The objective of the current thesis was to review the design methodology in current ship design regarding wave-induced structural loads and fatigue strength assessment. The outcome and contribution to both industrial and scientific relevance of the research work is a novel and comprehensive calculation procedure on the direct calculation of wave-induced loads and fatigue damage assessment with the target application of container ships. It comprises hydrodynamic analysis, finite element (FE) analysis followed by fatigue assessments. A 4400 TEU Panamax container ship is used for case study in the thesis. The wave loads and ship structural responses are based on the nonlinear time-domain hydrodynamic analysis, with particular attention to wave-induced torsion. Together with full-scale measurement data, the nonlinear vertical bending moments from hydrodynamic simulations are employed for the extreme hogging and sagging prediction. Global and local FE models of the ship are designed and used in the structural analysis. A procedure for calculation of the stress concentration factor (SCF) for local details is proposed which compares the ranges of the hot spot stress and the nominal stress. The results from the FE analysis are used in a fatigue assessment procedure. Fatigue damages in two structure details are calculated using the rainflow counting approach. Additionally, a designed wave scatter diagram for the North Atlantic was introduced for the computation of a long-term fatigue damage accumulation. The approach and models presented in the thesis have been validated against full-scale measurements of ship motions and stress responses. In addition, a numerical code for fatigue route planning and monitoring is presented, which will be further developed in future work. Finally, it is believed that the numerical procedure proposed contributes to enhanced accuracy in the estimation of fatigue damage of container ships...|$|R

40|$|Torsion {{is highly}} {{important}} for large container carriers. In order {{to maximize the}} container capacity, a large deck area is essential, which often leads to a big bow are. To simplify loading and ooading, each cargo hold is equipped with huge hatch <b>openings.</b> These large <b>deck</b> <b>openings,</b> with slender longitudinal and transverse deck strips, will deform due to torsion in oblique seas, referred to as hatch opening distortions. This is regarded a vital strength aspect for container carriers. A master project is performed, in order to investigate how torsion contributes to extreme loading. Full scale measurements of a 8600 TEU container vessel, conducted by DNV GL, theoretical methods, and a global and a local Finite Element (FE) model {{have been used for}} this purpose. This was done, to get a greater knowledge of torsional behaviour of container carriers, which again can be used to document whether torsion should be included in ship design rules. The ship has been operating on two dierent trades. On Route 1, the vessel follows a relatively sheltered passage from Hamburg to Singapore, whereas the vessel crosses the North Pacic Ocean from Singapore to USA on Route 2. Results from a hydrodynamic analysis, and environmental data for each route, was used to calculate the long term distribution of longitudinal stresses in deck. Long term distribution of deck stresses veries that Route 2, which is known for more rough seas, gives the worst prediction of stresses. However, the measured stresses prove dierent. In order to nd out why measured stresses are higher for Route 1, although Route 2 has more rough seas, the vessel's operating speed was investigated. It was found that the vessel operates at higher speeds on Route 1, than on Route 2. With speed reduction, the ship resistance, and the risk for occurrence of high stresses due to wave induced vibrations, such as whipping, springing and torsional vibrations, is lowered. Additionally, no signicant routing has been observed on the rst route. On the second route, on the other hand, routing was found, i. e. the roughest seas have been avoided. This will again inuence and lower measured stresses. Speed reduction and routing are therefore important reasons why measured stresses are lower on Route 2, than Route 1, {{despite the fact that the}} wave environment is more rough on Route 2. Measurement data have been investigated to evaluate the degree of torsional vibrations present. During the day where most torsion is measured, the ratio of dynamic and wave stresses ~ 1. 10, which indicates that the ship does not experience signicant torsional vibrations. Thus, torsional vibrations are found to be of minor concern for the 8600 TEU vessel. Global FE-analyses of the container vessel have been performed, with respect to the yielding criteria for Ultimate Limit State, ULS, due to torsion. Additionally, since many modications were done in order to analyse the model, self-checks of the model with vertical and horizontal bending moments were carried out. A coarse mesh was used to obtain nominal stresses. Rule stresses with respect to ULS were found by applying torsional moments, calculated from ship rules. The results show that maximum measured stresses in the deck strip are approximately 0. 69 - 0. 74 of ULS rule stresses for Route 1 and 0. 63 - 0. 68 on Route 2, i. e. measured stresses are within the acceptance criteria for ULS, on both routes. Since local stresses may be included in the measurements, the same analysis of the transverse deck strip was performed with ne mesh. Local stresses, and thus measured stresses, were found to be about 10 - 15 % higher than nominal stresses. The local stresses in the measurements are most likely due to the fact that the sensors are located close to hatch corners and close to a weld between two deck plates, which are source to stress concentrations, i. e. hot spot stresses. The magnitude of the hatch opening distortion has been calculated from the global FE-model. It was found that hatch opening distortion, due to the maximum measured stress of 131 MPa (measured on Route 1), has a magnitude of 226 mm. In comparison, the expected hatch opening distortion due to estimated ULS stresses is 335 mm at the deck strip where the sensors are located. The largest ULS hatch opening distortion obtained is located further forward, at cargo hold 3, where the deformations reaches 411 mm. The calculations were also done simplied, with use of hand calculations, 3 D-Beam, and a deck strip model. This, to nd out if simplied and less time consuming methods can be used in later studies of hatch opening distortions, or if a global model must be used for this purpose. Values for hatch opening distortion for the simplied calculation methods are between 7 - 21 % lower than calculated from the global model. If further studies of other container ships gives the same relation between the simplied methods and the global model, simplied methods might be used, introducing a scaling factor...|$|R

This method enables one to estimate the non-linear response of a passenger ship with a large multi-deck superstructure subjected to longitudinal bending. The method {{is based on the}} assumption that the ship structure can be modelled as a set of coupled beams. Each deck in the superstructure and also in the main hull can be considered as a thin-walled beam with non-linear structural behaviour. These beams are coupled to adjacent beams with non-linear springs called vertical and shear members, modelling the stiffness properties of the longitudinal bulkheads, side shells and pillars. Special emphasis was placed on the modelling of the shear members. A semi-analytic formula of the load-displacement curve was developed by help of the non-linear finite element analysis. Also, the load-end shortening curves under axial load taken from the literature were validated with the finite element method. The reverse loading options are included into the behaviour of the structural members. The created approach allows the calculation of the normal stresses and vertical deflections in the arbitrary location of the whole hull girder. Average longitudinal displacements and deflections of deck structures and shear stresses in the side structures can be estimated as well. The method is a further development of the linear coupled beam method. The {{ultimate strength}} of the hull girder was studied also with the non-linear finite element method. This required an investigation of the element mesh configuration in order to find an optimum mesh type and size. The prismatic hull girder of a post-Panamax passenger ship was chosen as a case study. The ultimate strength was estimated both in hogging and sagging loading with the coupled beam method and with the finite element method. The results of these two different methods, presented in the form of the bending moment versus the deflection of the hull girder, show good correlation up to the area where the moment starts to decrease. In both loading cases, the failure starts by the shear collapse in the longitudinal bulkhead. The ultimate stage of the strength was reached in the sagging loading when the failure progressed to the lower decks and correspondingly, in the hogging loading when the bottom structures failed in compression. The results on the structural failure modes show clearly that the shear strength of the longitudinal bulkheads and side structures is a very important issue on the ultimate strength problem of a passenger ship. reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Andrea Doria was {{designed}} with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads which {{ran across the}} width of her hull, rising {{from the bottom of}} the ship's hull up to A <b>Deck.</b> The only <b>openings</b> in the bulkheads were on the bottom deck, where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent compartments out of any of her 11 watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, Andrea Doria was also designed to take a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, no more than 15°. However, the combination of the five flooded tanks on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left Andrea Doria with a list which within a few minutes of the collision exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of Andrea Dorias watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. In addition, the collision had also torn into an access tunnel which ran from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had happened, to a small room at the forward end of the tank compartment which contained the controls for the pumps for the tanks. It was here that there was a fatal flaw in Andrea Dorias design, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no watertight door was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but also to a loss of electricity to the stricken liner.|$|R
