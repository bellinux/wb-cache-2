Not you {{understand}} because I’d wrestled with the same coding problem as him- <b>if</b> <b>you</b> recall he <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> a store look up tables in ROM. No, the feeling of déjà vu came from the other problem he was wrestling with: What is this monster we have created called C++? For me this thought is quickly followed by: How can anyone ever expect to master it? And then: How can I expect anyone to ever maintain this code? Now I always consider the Overload readership to be a pretty savvy bunch. People who are, on the whole, smarter than the average C++ developer, but how many of us could have tackled Stefan’s little task without encountering many of the same problems? I’ll go out on a limb, I don’t think any Overload reader could have tackled that problem and got it right in one sitting. I’ll go further, I don’t think even Herb Sutter, Bjarne Stroustrup or Andrei Alexandrescu could have done it in one sitting. Partly that’s because Stefan was engaged in a learning exercise.

Jeb of Metal Faith magazine said, [...] "each song sort of flows into the next giving the whole album a unified feel". Jeff of Mid West Metal magazine commented, [...] "having never been exposed to Opeth, I had them pegged as a typical black metal bands that sings about love and relationships and crap like that. I really didnt expect to get blown {{out of the water}} when April Ethereal kicked in, from this point I am converted! And while the album has some mellow parts and some folk-ish characteristics, its still a very intense album from a band who seems to have not forgotten how the fuck they got their current plateau in life." [...] Christian Renner of Metal Crypt wrote, [...] "the musicianship is brilliant as always and the songwriting is just what you would expect from this incredibly talented group. This is another great album that most bands out there would give their right arm to have written and that statement just speaks volumes of the songwriting talent of the Åkerfeldt/Lindgren team." [...] Pedro Azevedo of Chronicles of Chaos said of the album, [...] "though some parts of the drum sound are somewhat awkward at times (new drummer and bass player, by the way), the instrumental performance is as great as one would expect, and Akerfeldts vocals are again amazing. Top quality sections just flow throughout the album, making it truly -excellent-. My Arms, Your Hearse is a indeed a brilliant proof that Swedish metal isnt entirely stagnant." [...] Tartarean Desires critic Cseke Róbert wrote, [...] "this record is more powerful and more beautiful than most of todays music from this genre. The entire record is a mixture of hell-bound adrenalin and soul... My Arms, Your Hearse is such a powerful album that I consider it one of the best of the genre." [...] Demonic Tutor (Olivier Espiau) of Metal Storm stated the album is a [...] "trip to heaven" [...] and also: If the album Blackwater Park remains as Opeths masterpiece so far, My Arms, Your Hearse also deserves the maximal rating. I personally think that this record is equal to Blackwater Park ... Well, every metalhead on earth MUST have this album. If youre tired of your standards or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to discover new horizons in the metal world, or simply if you dont want to miss the best band for its creativity, listen to Opeth...
