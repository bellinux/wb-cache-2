The egg-shaped clock and its {{rectangular}} pedestal are decorated with translucent enamel on a <b>guilloché</b> <b>background.</b> The body of the clock is divided into twelve parts which are outlined in diamond-studded stripes.

The hours are indicated by a diamond clock hand shaped like the head of an arrow in a drawn bow. The hand is fixed to an immobile onyx base.

It is designed as a vase with red-gold scrolls serving as extra supports at either side. A gold key was used to wind the mechanism.|$|E
