60|$|The slight anxiety {{passed from}} her face like a cloud. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> {{positively}} brilliant.|$|E
60|$|Anne was embarrassed, and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> uncomfortable. 'I {{shall not}} tell you,' {{she said at}} last.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bogart called next day. She had a hen-like, crumb-pecking, diligent appearance. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> too innocent. The pecking started instantly: ...|$|E
5000|$|But 'twas so, {{and for a}} {{month or}} two, <b>her</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>were</b> freely given, ...|$|R
6000|$|The lilies are {{her pretty}} thoughts, [...] Her {{shoulders}} are the may, [...] <b>Her</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>are</b> all forget-me-nots, [...] The path 's her gracious way, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy!" [...] <b>Her</b> pose, <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>were</b> {{challenges}} that struck home. With swift, outflung arm, he encircled {{her waist and}} drew her to his breast. [...] "Boy, am I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not at all,” said Lady Demesne, {{smiling and}} looking at him. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> gentle, without rancour; he thought it almost beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|She {{watched him}} for a little while, until <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> quite gone, and then, {{returning}} to where her basket was, said gently: ...|$|E
60|$|The fair-haired Hafrydda, however, {{was not so}} timid, <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> evidently one of {{amusement}} at his defeat, which angered him all the more.|$|E
50|$|Lakshmi : Jimbron's love. Having {{lost both}} of her parents, she {{lived and worked in}} a grass jelly factory. Since the {{departure}} of her parents, she never <b>smiled</b> though <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> very sweet. She finally smiled when Jimbron came while riding Capo's white horse.|$|R
6000|$|Her lips, {{more than}} the {{cherries}} bright, [...] A richer dye has graced them; [...] They charm th' admiring gazer's sight, [...] And sweetly tempt to taste them; [...] <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> as the evening mild, [...] When feather'd pairs are courting, [...] And little lambkins wanton wild, [...] In playful bands disporting.|$|R
50|$|Specific power: She {{created the}} {{universe}} in the flash of <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>is</b> believed to bestow siddhis(supernatural powers) and niddhis(wealth) to Her devotees.|$|R
60|$|She shook herself {{free from}} him, but <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> almost a compensation. The taxicab had stopped {{opposite}} her door, and her servant came hurrying out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad, for my part," [...] was the reply. Josie's {{blue eyes}} were shining innocently and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> very sweet. Mary Louise {{regarded}} her suspiciously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go {{back and}} talk to the girl," [...] {{suggested}} Patsy. [...] "Somehow, the poor thing seems lonely, and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> more pathetic than cheerful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very--very like her, {{a little}} darker certainly,' said Sir Edward, 'but she {{reminds me of}} <b>her</b> constantly--there--that <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> my sister's exactly.' ...|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} toward him. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> now <b>was</b> more evident, {{and there was}} {{something}} in her eyes which was almost like a challenge.|$|R
6000|$|They {{all went}} within, through a hall to a great, cozy living-room. Mrs. Anderson's very first words, after <b>her</b> {{welcoming}} <b>smile,</b> <b>were</b> a half-faltered: ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{he asked}} an English question, [...] And she {{answered}} him in Dutch, [...] But <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> a suggestion, [...] And he treated it as such.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, sir," [...] {{said the}} young lady, and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> scarce {{concealed}} by her vizard, [...] "I shall have little use for such careful preparation." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little girl}} smiled again, and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> so like {{the smile of}} Lina Ridgely, twenty years ago, that his next words were inevitably tinged with reminiscence.|$|E
60|$|The soldier {{leaned forward}} to <b>her,</b> <b>smiling.</b> His face <b>was</b> near hers.|$|R
6000|$|She had {{established}} an attraction over the shrinking nature upon which <b>her</b> <b>smiling</b> eyes <b>were</b> fixed, for Georgiana {{held her hand}} while she answered in a secret and half-frightened tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To signify {{she agrees}} with {{everyone}} on every question; and <b>her</b> angelic <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> so genuine and constant {{that it gets}} to your heart {{in spite of all}} resistance.” ...|$|R
60|$|Rose looked {{intently at}} her lover, {{and she looked}} {{singularly}} lovely, for she blushed slightly, though <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> as open and amicable as ingenuousness and affection could make it.|$|E
60|$|She {{had told}} him before she could not dance. She glanced at his humility and smiled. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> very beautiful. It moved the man so that he forgot everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do," [...] said Alison. Hodder {{caught her}} eye again, {{and this time he}} was sure that she {{surprised}} in him a certain disdain of Mr. Atterbury's zeal. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> faint, yet unmistakable.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} her my soul, if it would serve her," [...] said Bold, still {{addressing}} his sister; [...] "everything I have is hers, if she will accept it; my house, my heart, my all; every hope of my breast is centred in her; <b>her</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>are</b> sweeter to me than the sun, and when I see her in sorrow as she now is, every nerve in my body suffers. No man can love better than I love her." ...|$|R
5000|$|In early 2012, {{she was a}} {{contestant}} on {{the second}} season of the NBC television show, The Voice {{as a member of}} Team Blake making it into the Top 24. Responding to her performance on the show, Naia earned accolades from the press with Rolling Stones review of her as [...] "an earthy soulstress...has a dynamic sound, and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> magic." [...] In March 2012 Entertainment Weekly picked Naia Kete as one of their Top 10 to win The Voice.|$|R
6000|$|Sherlock Holmes himself {{might have}} been misled. One can hear him {{explaining}} the thing to Watson {{in one of those}} lightning flashes of inductive reasoning of his. [...] "It is the only explanation, my dear Watson. If the lady were merely complimenting the gardener on his rose-garden, and if <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>were</b> merely caused by the excellent appearance of that rose-garden, there would <b>be</b> an answering <b>smile</b> {{on the face of the}} gardener. But, as you see, he looks morose and gloomy." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked from}} Helen to Roy and from Roy to Las Vegas. <b>Her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> for the latter, and {{to any one}} not overexcited by her story that smile would have told volumes.|$|E
60|$|She smiled, <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> {{really very}} sweet, and she blushed a little; it was {{singular}} {{that a woman}} of that age should flush so readily. Perhaps her naivete was her greatest charm.|$|E
60|$|Maud stole {{a glance}} at her sister, while the latter was speaking, from under her cap, and her cheeks now fairly put the riband to shame; but <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> still saucy and wilful.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was to}} Razumov {{that she}} gave <b>her</b> death's-head <b>smile.</b> <b>Her</b> tone <b>was</b> quite imperious.|$|R
50|$|Franciscan Fr. Janko Bubalo {{questioned}} the visionaries {{and asked them}} to describe Mary's appearance. They claim that Our Lady appears to be 18 to 20 years old, slender and around 165 cm tall. Her face is long and oval. She has black hair. Her eyes are blue with delicate eyelashes and thin black eyebrows. She has a nice, little nose and rosy cheeks. She has beautiful reddish thin lips and <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> more like some indescribable gentleness. It's visible as if somehow under her skin.|$|R
50|$|Pregnant {{photographer}} Emma Sloan (Anne Ramsay) {{arrives at}} a photo shoot for singer Tyson Ritter, but she quickly realizes {{there is something wrong}} when she cannot read the writing on a chalk board on the set. She quickly checks if <b>her</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> crooked, which it is; whether she can hold her arms straight, which she cannot; and whether her speech is slurred, which it is. Realizing what is happening, she tells the stunned people watching her that she is having a stroke before collapsing.|$|R
