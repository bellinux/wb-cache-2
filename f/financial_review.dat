5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian <b>Financial</b> <b>Review</b> in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

500|$|... 1988 was the bicentenary of {{non-indigenous}} {{settlement in}} Australia and, as such, there was {{renewed interest in}} the 'lost' second Sydney punchbowl. The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum, New Jersey, United States, titled Chinese Export Porcelain: A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections. The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former United States Congressman (in office 1953–1975). The discovery was made by Terry Ingram, a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art, who wrote about it in his Saleroom column, titled Newark Museum packs Aussie punch, in The Australian <b>Financial</b> <b>Review</b> on 25August 1988. It transpired {{that in the early}} 1930s, the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to raise interest from Sydney's cultural institutions. This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley, senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM)'s USA Gallery, the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the American people to Australia. In May 2006, the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM, a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits. The Australian <b>Financial</b> <b>Review</b> reported the acquisition in its Saleroom column, titled Museum bowled over, on 18May 2006. The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum's USA Gallery ever since. It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM, has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube. At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006, the bowl was valued at $A330,000.|$|E
500|$|The Australian <b>Financial</b> <b>Review</b> (AFR) had {{for years}} carried stories {{critical}} of managed investment schemes. An AFR story had prompted the letter, supporting the forest industries, from federal government minister Wilson Tuckey in 2000. When Great Southern collapsed, Tuckey was asked for comment by the Sydney Morning Herald. He said [...] "Everyone thought [...] {{was a good idea}} at the time". He argued investors would probably not lose their money, but [...] "shareholders and lenders could be in a bit of trouble". With both Great Southern Group and Timbercorp under administration, the AFR continued its editorial attack on government MIS policy. An AFR journalist wrote, [...] "as a general rule, MIS industries are inherently doomed to fail both from an investment and a social good perspective... Taxpayers should... not be surprised that they continue to fall over".|$|E

500|$|In January 2010, Republican Governor Linda Lingle {{publicly}} {{recommended that}} the city alter plans for the rail line after news reports on FTA documents where the federal agency raised issues over declining tax revenues {{in connection with a}} global economic recession, and commissioned a study by the state to review the project's finances in March. [...] The state financial study, publicly released on December 2, 2010, indicated that the project would likely experience a $1.7billion overrun above the $5.3billion projected cost, and that collections from the General Excise Tax would be 30% below forecasts. [...] Then Mayor Peter Carlisle (Democrat) dismissed the study as [...] "damaged goods," [...] and [...] "a pre-determined anti-rail rant." [...] He also pointed to several conclusions as [...] "erroneous" [...] and [...] "inaccurate" [...] before concluding that [...] "spending a third of a million dollars for this shoddy, biased analysis is an appalling waste of our tax dollars." [...] Lingle's Democratic successor, Neil Abercrombie, publicly stated that the financial analysis would not affect his decision to approve or disapprove of the project, saying that the state's responsibility is limited to the environmental review process, and that decisions regarding the project's finances belong to the city and the FTA. [...] Governor Abercrombie subsequently approved the project's final environmental impact statement on December 16, 2010. [...] The Honolulu City Council held a hearing on January 12, 2011 about the state's <b>financial</b> <b>review,</b> but the hearing was not attended by any state officials, who had been invited to testify.|$|E
