40|$|The {{central concern}} of the thesis is to develop {{concepts}} through which the relationship between society and space can be understood. It is argued that the concepts of society and space themselves need to be rethought. In fact deeply <b>discontinuous</b> <b>processes</b> are {{at the root of}} agency, society and space. These discontinuities are "patched over " by various narrative devices which allow for the emergence of coherent agents, social rules and homogeneous human space-times. Furthermore the processes by which this coherence emerges are fundamentally linked. Particular forms of agency are therefore linked to particular kinds of social system and particular patterns of space-time. It is suggested that the connection between. society and space can be understood from two interlinked perSpectives- that of the paths of individuals and organisations and that of the spaces and times of interaction.
