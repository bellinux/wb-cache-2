5|$|From that point, Manne refocused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> his own drumming. It {{might be}} argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he {{recorded}} numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E
5|$|In 610, {{during the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire after overthrowing Phocas. While Heraclius focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the {{internal}} affairs of his empire, the Sassanid Persians conquered Mesopotamia, overran Syria in 611, and entered Anatolia to occupy Caesarea Mazaca. In 612, Heraclius expelled the Persians from Anatolia. In 613, he launched a counter offensive against Syria, but was decisively defeated.|$|E
5|$|In AD 38, Caligula focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{political}} and public reform. He published {{the accounts of}} public funds, which had not been made public {{during the reign of}} Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes, and gave out prizes to the public at gymnastic events. He allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders.|$|E

5|$|After hearing NSDAP leader Hitler {{speak for}} the first time in 1920 at a Munich rally, Hess became {{completely}} devoted to him. They held a shared belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, the notion that Germany's loss in World War I was caused by a conspiracy of Jews and Bolsheviks rather than a military defeat. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July as member number 16. As the party continued to grow, holding rallies and meetings in ever larger beer halls in Munich, he focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> fundraising and organisational activities. On 4 November 1921 he was injured while protecting Hitler when a bomb planted by a Marxist group exploded at the Hofbräuhaus during a party event. Hess joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) by 1922 and helped organise and recruit its early membership.|$|E
5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E

Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during {{an episode of}} SmackDown! on September 4, 2003.

5|$|Hayes courted {{his future}} wife, Lucy Webb, {{during his time}} there. His mother had {{encouraged}} him {{to get to know}} Lucy years earlier, but Hayes had believed she was too young and focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> other women. Four years later, Hayes began {{to spend more time with}} Lucy. They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30, 1852, at the house of Lucy's mother. Over the next five years, Lucy gave birth to three sons: Birchard Austin (1853), Webb Cook (1856), and Rutherford Platt (1858). Lucy, a Methodist, was a teetotaler and abolitionist. She influenced her husband's views on those issues, although he never formally joined her church.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{professional}} obligations {{after the}} birth of his first son in 1987 coincided with a reduction in his literary output.

Two early versions of this novel's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die Rampe in 1994 (Der Schreiber von Aram) and 1997 (Das Gesetz). These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions. The publishing list on Ebner's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004, but seventeen are listed from between 2005 and 2008.|$|E

5|$|Lilly's friends often {{urged him}} to seek public office, and they {{attempted}} to nominate him to run for Governor of Indiana as a Republican in 1896, but he refused. Lilly shunned public office, preferring to focus <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> his philanthropic organizations. He did regularly endorse candidates, and made substantial donations to politicians who advanced his causes. After former Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton and others suggested {{the creation of a}} memorial to Indiana's many Civil War veterans, Lilly began raising funds to build the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Construction began in 1888, but the monument was not completed until 1901, three years after Lilly's death. The interior of the monument houses a civil war museum, established in 1918, that is named in Lilly's honor.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|While writing Prisoners of the Sun, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted to move to Argentina, and focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{completing}} all outstanding commissions so that he could focus on his emigration.

He also employed his friend Bernard Heuvelmans to help devise the ending of the story; he paid Heuvelmans 43,000 Belgian francs for doing so.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Constantinople a {{few months}} later however, Michael VIII was able to focus <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the defeat of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing Venetian–Genoese war, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of Oreos in Negroponte (Euboea), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys. This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Indians {{while in}} South Africa. He was not {{interested}} in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
25|$|According to some accounts, Ariston {{tried to}} force <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> Perictione, but failed in his purpose; then the god Apollo {{appeared}} {{to him in a}} vision, and as a result, Ariston left Perictione unmolested. Another legend related that, when Plato was an infant, bees settled on his lips while he was sleeping: an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse about philosophy.|$|R

5|$|Germany's {{war in the}} East {{was based}} on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Eastern Europe, aiming to defeat Poland, the Soviet Union and remove or kill the {{resident}} Jews and Slavs in the process. After the occupation of Poland, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos {{and those who were}} physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour. In 1941, Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely and planned that within 10 to 20 years the section of Poland under German occupation would be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists. About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves, part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations in the East.|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E
5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, the curator of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving back to London, in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
