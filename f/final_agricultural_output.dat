40|$|In 1999, Austrian farmers {{pushed up}} their {{production}} and value added {{in terms of}} volume at a hefty rate. Both indicators reached new peaks. In terms of value, however, the <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> was slightly lower than in 1998, the result of flagging prices. The total income achieved by the agricultural sector once again declined in 1999 (after losses in the three previous years in a row). Final output losses were due primarily to a slump in the hog market. The termination of degressive compensation payments in 1998 had a further deteriorating effect on the 1999 result. Regionally viewed, differences were small. Crop growers found that their good harvests depressed the markets; and the continuing crisis of the hog market further aggravated the situation for farmers. Flagging prices reduced the value of <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> to about ATS 62. 4 billion (1 percent less than in 1998). At ATS 31. 2 billion, the income obtained from agriculture and forestry was about 3. 0 percent lower than in the previous year. The last good farming years of the recent past were 1994 and 1995. Ever since, farming income has been under pressure, and its disparity compared to the wages outside agriculture is growing. Similarly, Austrian farmers' income has been lagging behind in an EU comparison since the mid 1990 s. In 1999, the <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> showed unusually little variation by Länder. Vienna was the only province to substantially increase its <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> (+ 6. 6 percent), the result primarily of an excellent fruit harvest. Output stagnated in Upper Austria, Salzburg and Tyrol. In Upper Austria, gains for cattle and dairy farmers more or less compensated for the (below-average) losses of pig farmers and crop growers. In Salzburg, losses from a modest fruit harvest and reduced felling were made up by a robust growth of cattle breeding and dairy production. In Tyrol, better results from cattle breeding and dairy production similarly offset most of the losses from fruit growing, hog breeding and forestry. Final outputs in Vorarlberg, Styria, Carinthia and Lower Austria were found to be slightly lower by 0. 6 to 1. 3 percent. The minor loss of farmers and forestry operators in Vorarlberg was caused by a bad fruit harvest, whereas breeders and forestry businesses recorded growth rates. Styria was affected by the hog market crisis at an above-average rate, and cattle farmers similarly suffered losses. Crop yields stagnated, whereas dairy farming and forestry had positive growth rates. In Carinthia, there was slightly less felling than in 1998, and the fruit harvest was low. Resulting losses were compensated only in part by better earnings from animal husbandry (with the exception of pigs). In Lower Austria, heavy losses from pig, poultry and cattle breeding could not be balanced by growth rates from a good wine and fruit harvest and higher dairy output. In Burgenland, farmers and forestry operations suffered the greatest decline, at – 3. 5 percent, caused by a lower wine harvest and above-average losses in all the main fields of animal husbandry. Direct payments to agricultural operations from public funds were about ATS 17. 3 billion in 1999, i. e., ATS 1. 1 billion (6. 7 percent) less than in 1998. As an average by provinces, the subsidies were the equivalent of about 35 percent of the <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output.</b> Regionally, subsidies ranged from 28 percent in Styria to 49 percent in Vorarlberg, but at 3 percent they were atypically low in Vienna. These figures show the crucial importance of the transfers with regard to production profitability and income formation for farmers within the scope of the common agricultural policy.

40|$|According to {{preliminary}} {{findings of the}} agricultural and forestry accounts, agricultural production achieved {{a slight increase in}} volume in 1997, which corresponds approximately to the medium-term trend. A good market for timber raised the farm price index by 2. 5 percent. Increased supply and higher prices boosted the final production value as well as the gross value added in agriculture and forestry by 2. 5 percent, respectively. Incomes from farming and forestry (contribution to the national income) nevertheless declined by about 4 percent compared to the previous year. The main cause of this loss was a reduction of direct payments to agricultural operations. In 1997, direct payments totaled ATS 20. 5 billion, about ATS 2. 2 billion or one tenth less than in 1996. Higher earnings from production did not fully compensate for the cuts. If direct payments had remained unchanged, 1997 would have been a good year for farmers, with above-average growth rates in earnings and incomes. In 1997, regional effects had an unusually high impact on <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> in the Länder. Most notable were the huge differences in their timber harvests and timber market positions, which produced extreme variations in earnings from forestry. Unusually great differences were also found in the wine harvests. Differences in the production structure, on the other hand, were less important for the final output than in most of the previous years. The best result in terms of final agricultural production (final output) – a plus of 12. 3 percent over 1996 – was recorded by the agricultural and forestry operations in Salzburg. Above-average performances were also achieved in Burgenland, Carinthia, Tyrol and Vorarlberg, where growth rates ranged between 5 percent and 8 percent. The extremely high growth rate of Salzburg and the excellent results in Tyrol and Vorarlberg originated in an explosive growth of earnings from forestry. Carinthia similarly profited from the timber market situation, thanks to its abundance of woods, although timber cuts were slightly lower. In Burgenland, the growth was fueled by the recovery of the wine-growing business and better earnings from forestry. In Upper Austria (+ 2. 5 percent), an above-average growth in earnings from forestry and crop farming was partly absorbed by losses from cattle and dairy farming, which is a major factor in that region. In Styria (– 0. 2 percent), the <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> stagnated at the previous year's level, after two en-suite years of above-average growth. Higher earnings from crop farming and animal husbandry were reduced by losses from forestry, since timber harvesting had been substantially reduced. In Lower Austria and Vienna, the output remained just below the previous year's rates (– 0. 9 percent). In both Länder, the modest result was mostly due to a failure of the wine crop. In Lower Austria, it was compounded by stagnating earnings from animal husbandry and a significant reduction of the timber harvest which depressed additional earnings. In 1997, direct payments to farms were lower than in the previous year in all Länder with the exception of Vorarlberg, where farmers profited from the newly introduced "environmental allowance". In Vienna, direct payments, at 5. 8 percent, were unusually low compared to the final output. The market gardens were especially affected by the scheduled reduction of degressive compensation payments. In the other Länder, direct payments ranged from 30 percent (Styria) to 58 percent (Tyrol) of the final output at market prices. Such substantial regional differences in the level and development of direct payments derive primarily from the production structure of the region, its categorization and resultant aid level, and on the rate of farm participation in various programs, especially the Environmental Programme.

40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within national guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to <b>final</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets.

Using South African data, the study investigated the causal relationship between the supply of credit and <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> as well as whether the two are cointegrated and have a short-run relationship. The study found that bank credit and <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> are cointegrated. Using the error correction model (ECM), the results showed that, in the short-run, bank credit has a negative impact on <b>agricultural</b> <b>output,</b> reflecting the uncertainties of institutional credit in South Africa.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to assess}} the impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> changes on the general price level over time with China as an example. Design/methodology/approach – A simple {{numerical}} global general equilibrium (GE) model of two regions (China and the rest of the world) and three commodities (agriculture, manufacturing goods, and services) is used {{to assess the}} impacts of <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> changes on the overall economy price changes. The numerical GE model of this paper consists of production, final consumption, and market clear conditions. The results are generated with the GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005. Findings – The results suggest that China witnessed a declining influence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> changes on general price changes. The contribution of given <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> change on the general price change in 2005 was merely less than 60 percent of that in 1987, which in turn implies that macro policies targeting to curb general inflation via boosting <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> will be less effective as those of 20 years ago. Practical implications – China's policy makers should rely less and less on promoting <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> policies to fight against general inflation and should resort to non-agricultural policies. Originality/value – The paper argues that the influence of agriculture on the China's general price indices has been weakening along with China's economic development with a numerical GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005.

The analysis is conducted by estimating production in agriculture, which was the pillar of the economy of ancient Japan. Specifically, arable land, land productivity, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> are estimated for three benchmark years – 725, 900, and 1150 – using quantitative data obtained from ancient records. The results indicate that (1) economic growth in ancient Japan was relatively steady and moderate, and (2) <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> per capita was very low and ordinary farmers must have struggled to survive on their income from agricultural sources alone. The findings thus suggest that ancient Japan was reliant on agriculture, which however, was poorly developed and showed little technological development, {{so that there was}} little economic growth. long-run economic growth, living standards, arable land, land productivity, <b>agricultural</b> <b>output,</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>output</b> per capita...|$|R
