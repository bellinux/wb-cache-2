The accident arose from Stokes’ conduct in ignoring the flashing warning lights at the railroad crossing and attempting to drive through the crossing ahead of an oncoming train traveling at nearly 80 miles per hour, where the resulting collision caused pieces of rebar to be thrown onto the tracks derailing the train." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aluminium engine cradles and {{suspension}} struts for stretched Lincoln Town Car {{were the}} first automotive parts that were friction stir at Tower Automotive, who use the process also for the engine tunnel of the Ford GT. A spin-off of this company is called Friction Stir Link, Inc. and successfully exploits the FSW process, e.g. for the <b>flatbed</b> <b>trailer</b> [...] "Revolution" [...] of Fontaine Trailers. In Japan FSW is applied to suspension struts at Showa Denko and for joining of aluminium sheets to galvanized steel brackets for the boot (trunk) lid of the Mazda MX-5. Friction stir spot welding is successfully used for the bonnet (hood) and rear doors of the Mazda RX-8 and the boot lid of the Toyota Prius. Wheels are friction stir welded at Simmons Wheels, UT Alloy Works and Fundo. Rear seats for the Volvo V70 are friction stir welded at Sapa, HVAC pistons at Halla Climate Control and exhaust gas recirculation coolers at Pierburg. Tailor welded blanks are friction stir welded for the Audi R8 at Riftec. The B-column of the Audi R8 Spider is friction stir welded from two extrusions at Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria.|$|E

[...] In September 2002, he read that the quarry crew [...] "was getting ready to look for and replace the tomb's marble and that the (Veterans Administration) and Arlington were accepting bids on the replacement piece." [...] With {{that he decided to}} pay the $31,000 for the replacement block. [...] Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent John Metzler requested a letter on the donation and was sent one. [...] Mr Haines also arranged for free transportation to Arlington National Cemetery. [...] In 2003 a prospective block was found and quarrying began. [...] To record the activity, Ron Bailey photographed the event. [...] When the block came free from the mountain, imperfections were found so the block was rejected. [...] (The heart of the block was used for a statue of President George H.W. Bush.) [...] Another search started with a flawless block quarried and brought down to the storage area in Marble in 2005. Since 2005, the block has remained on the same yellow <b>flatbed</b> <b>trailer</b> in the north-west corner of the storage yard due to replacement opposition.|$|E

50|$|Draglines {{fall into}} two broad categories: those {{that are based on}} standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site.
