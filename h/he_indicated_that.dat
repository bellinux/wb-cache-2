In his report, <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> as Windows 7 support {{will be provided}} until 2020, enterprises should directly migrate to Windows 10 after it is released. Furthermore, he recommended to downgrade devices installed with Windows 8.1 to Windows 7 until Windows 10 is available.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E

5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, in {{recognition}} of the sociopolitical progress made in Somalia and its return to effective governance, US Secretary of State John Kerry announced a preliminary plan to reestablish the US embassy in Mogadishu. <b>He</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> although there was no set timetable for the premises' relaunch, the US government had immediately begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke also presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. Mohamud concurrently signed an Establishment Agreement with the EU Head of Delegation in Somalia Michele Cervone d’Urso, which facilitates the opening of more embassies in Mogadishu by European Union member states. The EU also announced that it had opened a new EU Delegation office in the city.|$|E
50|$|Commander-In-Chief of the Somali National Army General Dahir Adan Elmi (Indho Qarsho) {{declares}} that 17 Al-Shabaab fighters {{have been killed}} following illegal roadblock clearance operations by government soldiers in the Lower Shabelle region. <b>He</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> 300 troops and six armored fighting vehicles {{were sent to the}} province after uniformed militiamen had been extorting money from trucks traveling along the road between Mogadishu and Lower Shabelle.

5|$|Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said {{immediately}} after the race that nine teams– all but Ferrari– agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he could not support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant {{that by the time}} Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected {{as far back}} as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served {{as the basis for the}} report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986.|$|E

5|$|While riding for Astana in the 2007 Tour de France, Alexander Vinokourov tested {{positive}} for blood doping, causing the entire team {{to be removed from}} the race and Vinokourov to retire after being banned from the sport by his national federation and the UCI. After confirming in October 2008 his intention to return to competitive cycling, Vinokourov stated {{on the eve of the}} 2009 Tour de France that he would rejoin Astana, the team he believes was created expressly for him, at the expiration of his two-year ban on July 24. <b>He</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> Astana manager Johan Bruyneel will be bound by the team's sponsors to accept him, or else Bruyneel would be forced from the team. Bruyneel publicly stated in April 2008 that he did not want Vinokourov on a team he ran.|$|E
5|$|Another effort {{involving}} the plan came about after Milošević asked the United States to stop an imminent Croatian {{attack against the}} RSK on 30 July. Although in his request <b>he</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> negotiations should be held based on the Z-4 Plan, he refused to meet Galbraith (who wanted Milošević to pressure the RSK into accepting it) on 2 August. Instead, Galbraith met Babić in Belgrade {{in an effort to}} persuade him to accept the plan. He told Babić that the RSK could not expect international sympathy because of its involvement in the Siege of Bihać, and they would have to accept Croatian terms to avoid war. As an alternative, Galbraith advised Babić to accept negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan. Babić complied, and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK delegations to talks on 3 August. Genthod, near Geneva, was selected as the location to avoid media attention. The RSK delegation was headed by Major General Mile Novaković of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian delegation was headed by Tuđman's advisor, Ivić Pašalić.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1942, Gollob {{was made}} Jagdfliegerführer 3, {{responsible}} for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 (Jafü5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, {{he was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jafü5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf109 on the Western Front. <b>He</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> in its present state the Bf109G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw190 and Bf109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor.|$|E

5|$|The {{first trial}} with the Y1 railcars was {{performed}} on 1August 2000. The one unit {{was not able to}} complete the route due to technical problems, but the other train was able to. Terje Bulling, the CEO of Timetoget, stated that he was aiming for 140,000 passengers in 2001, but was worried because NSB, due to lack of engineers, was driving passengers with by taxi between Notodden Station and Nordagutu. On 5October, Vidar Østreng, vice president in NSB and chairman of Timetoget, announced that NSB, due to lack of engineers, would have to reduce the production of train services. <b>He</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the least profitable routes, including the Bratsberg Line, would be closed. At the same time, NSB said one possibility could be that they sold their 89% stake in the company, thereby bypassing NSB's rules for engineer training. Five days later, the engineers in NSB stated that they would not operate trains between Larvik Station and Skien, and Kongsberg Station and Bø Station, if Timetoget was allowed to operate. These sections of the Vestfold Line and Sørlandet Line, respectively, are shared with the Bratsberg Line. The engineers considered lack of sufficient training such a safety risk {{that it would not be}} secure to operate on the lines. At the same time, NSB announced that they would stop operating trains on the Bratsberg Line from 20October.|$|E
