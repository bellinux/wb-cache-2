The big fist took him square on the mouth and chin and laid him flat on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Sight</b> failed Slone for a little, and {{likewise}} ability to move. But he did not lose consciousness. His head seemed to have been burst into rays and red mist that blurred his eyes. Then these cleared away, leaving intense pain. He started to get up, his brain in a whirl. Where was his gun? He had left it at home. But for that he would have killed Bostil. He had already killed one man. The thing was a burning flash--then all over! He could do it again. But Bostil was Lucy's father! ...|$|E

Until, the twentieth century, most expeditions were for commercial purpose, to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting. A piece of wood, from the South Shetland Islands, was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica, obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829-31, commanded by Captain Benjamin Pendleton.|$|R

50|$|Changes in the {{anti-tank}} tactics {{since the}} Second World War mostly {{came from the}} appearance of new technologies, and increased firepower of the infantry mounted on fully armored vehicles.

And the watchers saw that this great ship was merely being blown away with the other bits of debris great and small that filled the sky.

Dismounting at the door we shook hands with him, were led through the idle mob into a smoky closet contrived against the inside wall, and were regaled with wheaten bread steeped in honey and rancid butter. The host left us to eat, and soon afterwards returned:--I looked with attention at a man upon whom so much then depended.|$|R

40|$|Ship-based {{sighting}} surveys for cetaceans {{were conducted}} in the former whaling ground off the northeastern coast of Brazil. The cruises took place in winter and spring of 1998 - 2001 with the objectives of investigating current distribution and abundance of cetaceans, particularly large whale species taken during whaling. In 1998 the survey were conducted between the parallels 5 ° 30 ’W and 9 °S and the 200 m isobath and the meridian 033 °W. A total of about 3, 100 nm were surveyed between 1998 and 2001 Surveys were conducted using line transect methods from about 5 - 10 °S, and from the coast to 33 °W. A total of 151 sightings (203 individuals) of large whales were recorded on effort. The Antarctic minke whale – Balaenoptera bonaerensis (Burmeister, 1867) was the most frequently sighted species (97 groups/ 132 individuals; Sighting Rate [SR] = 0. 031 groups/nm), being recorded only in offshore waters. Density gradually increased from August to October. Minke whales were distributed throughout the area, both {{to the north and}} the south of former whaling <b>ground.</b> <b>Sighting</b> data indicate this is the most abundant species, particularly in the area beyond the continental shelf break. Breeding behavior was observed for Antarctic minke whales, but few groups containing calves were recorded (4. 3 % of the groups sighted on effort). Three other large whale species were recorded in low numbers: the Bryde’s whale – Balaenoptera edeni (Anderson, 1879) 1, the sei whale, B. borealis (Lesson, 1828), and the sperm, Physeter macrocephalus (Linnaeus, 1758). Sei, Bryde and sperm whales were regularly caught during whaling operations, but are rare in the area, suggesting they were depleted by whaling and have yet to recover to their pre-explotation abundance. In contrast, minke whales are abundant in this area, suggesting that either they were not substantially depleted, or that they have recovered rapidly. Blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus (Linnaeus, 1758), and fin whale, B. physalus (Linnaeus, 1758), not recorded on our surveys, have always been extremely rare in the area...|$|R

Stuart with his cavalry moved on the flank of the column whenever the ground was open, so as to conceal the march of the infantry from the enemy. As the rear of the column passed a spot called the Furnace, the enemy suddenly advanced and cut off the 23d Georgia, who were {{in the rear of the}} column, and captured the whole regiment with the exception of a score of men. At this point the road turned almost directly away from Chancellorsville, and the enemy believed that the column was in full retreat, and had not the least idea of its real object.|$|R

50|$|Sight screens have, on occasion, {{not been}} {{large enough to}} entirely cover the {{critical}} area for the batsman to effectively view the bowler's delivery. Groundskeepers may make such decisions to allow for more spectators into the <b>ground.</b> Similarly, <b>sight</b> screens {{have in the past}} been used for display advertising, compromising their darkness (in limited overs matches) or whiteness (in Tests). On such occasions, batting sides have often expressed frustration, especially if particular batsmen experienced difficulty in effectively seeing the ball during a fast bowler's delivery. Jacques Kallis succumbed to an Andrew Flintoff full toss at Edgbaston Cricket Ground under these circumstances during South Africa's tour of England in 2008, an incident that triggered much debate at the time. In today's game, advertising in ICC-sanctioned Test matches is only allowed on the sight screen behind the wicket-keeper, so that it must be removed every other over and then replaced again after the next over is played from the other end.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1918, No. 209 was on patrol when they became engaged in combat with fighters of Jagdstaffel 11, led by Manfred von Richthofen, the [...] "Red Baron". A {{newcomer}} to No. 209, Brown's school friend, Lt. Wop May, had been instructed to stay clear of any fight and watch. May noticed an enemy pilot doing the same thing. That pilot was the Red Baron's cousin, Lt. Wolfram von Richthofen, who {{had been given the}} same instructions as May. May attacked Wolfram and soon found himself in the main fight, firing at several fleeting targets until his guns jammed. May dived out of the fight, and Manfred von Richthofen gave chase down to ground level. Brown saw May in trouble and dived steeply in an attempt to rescue his friend. His attack was necessarily of fairly short duration, as he was obliged to climb steeply to avoid crashing into the <b>ground,</b> losing <b>sight</b> for the moment of both Richthofen and May.|$|R
