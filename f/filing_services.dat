40|$|<b>Filing</b> <b>services</b> have {{experienced}} a number of innovations in recent years, {{but many of these}} promising Ideas have faded to enter into broad use. One reason is that current filing environ-ments present several barriers to new development. For example, file systems today typically stand alone instead of building on the work of others, and support of new <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> often requires changes that invahdate existing work. Stackable file-system design addresses these issues m several ways. Complex fihng services are constructed from layer “building blocks, ” each of which may be provided by independent parties. There are no syntactic constraints to layer order, and layers can occupy different address spaces, allowing very flexible layer configuration Independent layer evolution and development are supported by an extensible interface bounding each layer This paper discusses stackable layering in detad and presents design techniques it enables We describe an implementation providing these facilities that exhibits very high performance. By lowering barriers to new filing design, stackable layering offers the potential of broad third-party file-system development not feasible today...|$|E

The present paper studies the influence of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction on taxpayers’ behavioral intentions to adopt electronic tax <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> in an emerging economy. For this study, constructs from Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1991), Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989), and Information System Success Model (DeLone & McLean, 1992) are used. In order to test the impact of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction on behavioral intentions to adopt online tax filing system, we develop several hypotheses. The data is collected from 201 respondents who filed taxes using government or private vendor websites. A structural equation modelling scheme using PLS is used to analyse the model.

40|$|From {{a survey}} of {{employer}} payroll / tax filing practices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) determined that some businesses prepare their own tax reports using payroll/tax software developed internally or purchased or they contract with a third party. Subsequently, BLS developed an electronic data collection strategy for the quarterly Multiple Worksite Report (MWR), which is filed by 112, 000 legal entities representing 1. 2 million worksites. BLS has recently been {{working closely with the}} developers of payroll/tax software and with firms providing payroll/tax <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> to include the electronic transmittal of MWR data in their systems. In the past, employers that had multiple establishments in many states had to manually file paper MWRs with each state. With electronic reporting, data for all states are sent directly to BLS, which edits the data and forwards it to the proper state. This paper discusses the background information noted above and the various approaches that BLS staff have used to solicit the cooperation of these firms to modify their systems to include electronic reporting as an option or additional service...|$|E
40|$|As mobile clients travel, {{their costs}} to reach home <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> change, with serious {{performance}} implications. Current file systems mask these performance problems {{by reducing the}} safety of updates, their visibility, or both. This {{is the result of}} combining the propagation and notification of updates from clients to servers. Fluid Replication separates these mechanisms. Client updates are shipped to nearby replicas, called WayStations, rather than remote servers, providing inexpensive safety. WayStations and servers periodically exchange knowledge of updates through reconciliation, providing a tight bound on the time until updates are visible. Reconciliation is non-blocking, and update contents are not propagated immediately; propagation is deferred {{to take advantage of the}} low incidence of sharing in file systems. Our measurements of a Fluid Replication prototype show that update performance is completely independent of wide-area networking costs, at the expense of increased sharing costs. This places the costs of sharing on those who require it, preserving common case performance. Furthermore, the benefits of independent update outweigh the costs of sharing for a workload with substantial sharing. A trace-based simulation shows that a modest reconciliation interval of 15 seconds can eliminate 98 % of all stale accesses. Furthermore, our traced clients could collectively expect availability of five nines, even with deferred propagation of updates. ...|$|E
