The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures {{is one of the}} final documents approved {{at the conclusion of the}} Uruguay Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It applies to all sanitary (relating to animals) and phytosanitary (relating to plants) (SPS) measures that may have a direct or indirect impact on international trade. The SPS agreement includes a series of understandings (trade disciplines) on how SPS measures will be established and used by countries when they establish, revise, or apply their <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations.</b> Countries agree to base their SPS standards on science, and as guidance for their actions, the agreement encourages countries to use standards set by international standard setting organizations. The SPS agreement seeks to ensure that SPS measures will not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against trade of certain other members nor be used to disguise trade restrictions. In this SPS agreement, countries maintain the sovereign right to provide the level of health protection they deem appropriate, but agree that this right will not be misused for protectionist purposes nor result in unnecessary trade barriers. A rule of equivalency rather than equality applies to the use of SPS measures.|$|E

Modern biotechnology {{has the potential to}} further development and improve human welfare, but the potential impact of environmental releases of LMOs on other species and varied ecosystems also implies significant and unexplored risks. The adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol) contributes to the development of an international regulatory framework to enable international trade in environmentally sound applications of biotechnology. This book analyses the legal aspects of implementing the Cartagena Protocol. It provides a serious contribution to current legal and academic debates on biosafety by analysing key issues under the Cartagena Protocol that affect the design and implementation of national biosafety regulatory regimes, in a manner that takes the principles of sustainable development law into account, and can inform future evolution of the international regime.

The ATAD has imposed a legally binding obligation upon EU Member States to incorporate the conclusions of Action 2 (hybrid mismatch arrangements), Action 3 (controlled foreign company (CFC) rules) and Action 4 (interest deductions) of the BEPS in their <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> and it has secured a certain uniformity of national implementing measures across the EU by imposing a common minimum level of protection.

The potential impact of this milestone Directive on the Internal Market and the tax systems of Member States in a short- to long-term period is still to be evaluated. This article offers preliminary thoughts, focusing primarily on the UK’s perspective.

40|$|Archaeologists {{around the}} world face complex ethical {{dilemmas}} that defy easy solutions. Ethics <b>and</b> <b>law</b> entwine, yet jurisprudence endures as the global praxis for guidance and result. Global legal norms articulate 2 ̆ 7 legal rights 2 ̆ 7 and obligations while codes of professional conduct articulate 2 ̆ 7 ethical rights 2 ̆ 7 and obligations. This article underscores how a rights discourse has shaped the 20 th century discipline and practice of archaeology across the globe, including {{in the design and}} execution of projects like those discussed in the Journal of Field Archaeology. It illustrates how both <b>law</b> <b>and</b> ethics have been, and still are, viewed as two distinct solution-driven approaches that, even when out of sync, are the predominant frameworks that affect archaeologists in the field and more generally. While both <b>law</b> <b>and</b> ethics are influenced by social mores, public policy, and political objectives, each too often in cultural heritage debates has been considered a separate remedy. For archaeology, there remains the tendency to turn to law for a definite response when ethical solutions prove elusive. As contemporary society becomes increasingly interconnected and the geo-political reality of the 21 st century poses new threats to protecting archaeological sites and the integrity of the archaeological record during armed conflict <b>and</b> insurgency, <b>law</b> has fallen short or has lacked necessary enforcement mechanisms to address on-the-ground realities. A changing global order shaped by human rights, Indigenous heritage, legal pluralism, neo-colonialism, development, diplomacy, and emerging non-State actors directs the 21 st century policies that shape <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> ethics. Archaeologists in the field today work within a nexus of <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> international <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> must navigate increasingly complex ethical situations.

40|$|As {{economic}} and trade policies continue to affect more facets of society, the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) impact on government policy and citizens’ lives has grown. Since its creation on January 1, 1995, the WTO has fostered trade liberalization negotiations {{and served as}} a forum where member countries can discuss economic concerns with one another. The WTO is perhaps best known for its dispute settlement mechanism. When countries cannot reach a mutual resolution to a conflict governed by a trade agreement, they can initiate formal legal proceedings against one another by asking for a panel to be appointed. The panel then hears the complaint and issues a ruling, which may be appealed by either of the parties on legal grounds. The ruling simply identifies which, if any, WTO obligations are being breached, but does not impose punishment. If the losing country does not move to conform to its WTO obligations, the other member country may request permission from the Dispute Settlement Body to impose trade sanctions, which must be granted within thirty days unless a consensus of member countries disagrees. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) acceded to the WTO in 2001, following its successful trade negotiations with WTO members, principally the United States. As part of its accession, the PRC government was also required to adopt the WTO’s multilateral trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). All three agreements require the PRC to implement <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> in conformity with the agreements. To the ire of many U. S. corporations and under criticism from Western media, however, the PRC has continued a policy of Internet censorship. The PRC’s censorship regime is estimated to cost U.

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{world is}} {{continuously}} becoming a {{smaller and smaller}} place. It has become a global community of sorts merely divided by imperceptible borders that are easily transversed by ever-evolving technological advances {{in the fields of}} business, travel, communication and such, each regulated by its own set of <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations.</b> Hordes of South Africans immigrate to Australia annually due to, among others, economic and political uncertainty. These ex-patriots generally leave behind assets and creditors in South Africa whilst acquiring new ones wherever they choose to establish themselves. This serves as basis for potential future cross-border insolvency issues. Furthermore, entities such as companies trading internationally, and multinational companies with branches and offices in more than one state, have property and creditors in many different jurisdictions. Should such a company be liquidated, it would give rise to questions of jurisdiction, the procedures to be followed, the appointment of a liquidator(s) and the distribution of assets, to name a few. The absence of a universal cross-border insolvency law leaves room for much uncertainty and confusion. What is of importance for purposes of this research is to clarify all prevailing uncertainties regarding the rights and obligations of the foreign representative and the foreign creditor in cross-border insolvency matters. The foreign representative is the person or entity appointed to administer the reorganisation or liquidation of the insolvent debtor’s assets in a foreign proceeding. The inconsistency in cross-border insolvency regulations between South Africa and Australia has the consequence that {{there is no guarantee that}} a foreign creditor in one state will be treated the same as a foreign creditor in terms of the domestic laws of the other, as the Model Law aims to do. The situation would have been significantly less complicated had the South African Cross-Border Insolvency Act been in force at present and had Australia been designated as a state to which this Act would apply. In that case, the treatment of foreign representatives and foreign creditors would be of a reciprocal nature. This dissertation attempts, through an investigation of the South African and Australian domestic insolvency laws, to ascertain the position of the foreign representative and foreign creditors pre and post incorporation of the Model Law. Consequently this dissertation compares the legal positions of these parties in terms of South African and Australian national insolvency legislation. Master...|$|E

40|$|Globalization is a {{defining}} phenomenon of our time. The current model, corporate economic globalization, is {{a version of}} globalization which is being implemented by a new array of international commercial agreements. While these pacts are called "trade" agreements, today's international commercial agreements no longer focus solely on traditional trade matters, such as reducing tariffs and quotas. Instead, the main mechanisms of globalization, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), contain a comprehensive set of one-size-fits-all policies to which signatory countries are required to conform their <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations.</b> These pacts prioritize commerce over other goals and values, in part by setting constraints on what environmental, food or product safety, social justice and other policies our national, {{state and local governments}} may implement. Yet, while institutions and agreements like the WTO, NAFTA and a whole alphabet soup of other globalization mechanisms and institutions have deep and direct impacts on many facets of the daily lives of people everywhere, the meaning and implications of their terms are often unintelligible. First, the agreements are written in a technical trade jargon which we have dubbed "GATTese. " In GATTese, words with a clear meaning in common usage have entirely different meanings or implications. In some cases, one or two words are shorthand for entire twenty-year bodies of trade law jurisprudence that simply are not evident {{on the face of the}} term. Second, words used in trade and investment agreements have extremely precise legal meanings which can turn on the slight difference in a verb's tense. Since the text of these agreements are often only available in English (or perhaps also French), non-native speakers are put at a disadvantage from the start. Third, there are certain basics of legal interpretation that most non-lawyers simply do not know which can mask completely the meaning of trade agreement language. The actual provisions of some of the key mechanisms of globalization [...] such as the WTO and NAFTA [...] are so drastic that simply being able to understand what they mean for our environmental, food safety, social justice and other laws and policies is one of critics' strongest arguments. Meanwhile, innocent errors in interpretation made by critics are often used by proponents of corporate-managed trade to undermine the credibility of legitimate criticisms. This guide is intended to help people go to the legal sources with an understanding of some of the most essential specialized terms, language and legal quirks of globalization's instruments. Its goal is to empower the maximum number of people to be able to make their own informed decisions about the often intentionally murky provisions hidden in policies and agreements promoting corporate globalization...|$|E

40|$|Strategic {{management}} {{addresses the}} question of why some organizations succeed and others fail. While the field of strategic management has developed rapidly, no one has attempted to investigate the strategic management practices of a particular industry in Sri Lanka. Hence, this research aims to explore the strategic management practices of the Sri Lankan commercial banks and to provide original knowledge about the strategic management practices of a particular industry in a developing country. Licensed commercial banks dominate the financial sector in Sri Lanka and as at 31 st December 2005 there were 22 commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka. The Banking sector has shown a significant expansion during the last five years. Despite the significant expansion, the banking industry in Sri Lanka is currently going through a period of rapid change due to new products and services being introduced by the banking industry as a result of globalization and the adoption of new technologies. Therefore, an exploration of the current strategic management practices of the Sri Lankan commercial banks will be extremely important for every commercial bank in the Sri Lankan banking industry. The prominent authors in the field of strategic management fall in to two main categories in the way they look at strategy, namely the “strategic planning” or the “strategic thinking” approach. This study aims to investigate both the strategic planning and the strategic thinking capabilities of the Sri Lankan commercial banks. However, the major priority of this research is to investigate the strategic planning practices which are currently playing {{a major role in the}} strategic management practices of the Sri Lankan commercial banks. Because of the exploratory nature of the study research objectives were stated instead of research hypotheses. The large number of variables that were expected to be investigated in this study, together with no prior knowledge about how the variables would behave in the Sri Lankan banking industry meant that this study was developed around key research questions. The theoretical framework for this study is based predominately on previous research studies but was adapted to the Sri Lankan banking industry and in accord with the major research questions of this research study. Except for one commercial bank all the commercial banks in Sri Lanka participated in this study, a response rate of 95. 5 %. The primary data was collected through personal interviews using a questionnaire with senior executives who were responsible for their corporate planning. The respondents were categorized according to ownership, size, and planning system aspects. Except for one bank all the banks had a formalized strategic planning system at their corporate level. Thus, whether it is a large, medium or small sized bank strategic planning systems played a major role in these banks strategic management processes. However, the top management of most of these banks were also aware of the importance of having strong strategic thinking capabilities. It would appear that the banks preferred to have formalized strategic planning systems and also seek to develop strategic thinking capabilities. Overall banks spent most of their strategic planning effort on action planning or operational planning for the next 1 to 3 years. Most of the effort spent on forecast development was in the areas of <b>domestic</b> economy, <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> for the financial services sector, industry level demand, and competitive analysis and in these areas the forecasts were transmitted to a reasonably high degree from corporate level to second level. The responsibilities for a number of strategic analyses were decentralized to the operations, marketing and second level managers to some degree but the corporate level was mainly responsible for competitive, supplier, customer, political, social and cultural analyses whereas operations people were mainly responsible for technological analyses. The medium sized, large, locally owned and government owned banks were identified as being moderate strategic thinkers whereas the small sized and foreign owned banks were identified as being weak strategic thinkers. There were no strong strategic thinkers identified amongst the banks. Strategic thinking capabilities such as strategic intent and intelligent opportunism were identified as low in most banks. Thus, there is much room to improve the strategic thinking capabilities of Sri Lankan commercial banks. Corporate strategies such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures did not play a major role in most banks corporate planning during the last five years and are also not expected to play a significant role in the next five years. However, a reasonable number of banks had executed turnaround strategies during the last five years. Benchmarking has also played a reasonably high role in these banks during the last five years. The management of quality is also considered as important and is being addressed as a strategic issue to a great extent. There are number of significant contributions from of this research study. First, this study has identified and discussed the overall strategic management characteristics of Sri Lankan commercial banks and their expected changes to their strategic management practices in the next five years.
