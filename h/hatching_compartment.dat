40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out to clarify the mode of S. senftenberg {{infection}} in newly hatched chicks in some hatcheries situated in or near Sapporo and to clarify the presence or disappearance of S. senftenberg which invaded into baby chicks' bodies. At the same time the reasons for the appearance of S. senftenberg in <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments</b> of incubators and the influence of S. senftenberg upon baby chicks were discussed. The conclusions obtained are summarized as follows : 1. In any hatchery so far as the writers have investigated, S. senftenberg came to be detected in the <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments</b> of incubators at time over 6 〜 7 weeks after the beginning of hatching (Tables 1, 2 and 3). 2. The newly hatched chicks originated from such incubators are usually infected in the incubators with S. senftenberg through their respiratory and digestive organs, and the rate of S. senftenberg infection among chicks tends to run parallel with the rate of multiplication of S. senftenberg in the incubator (Tables 1, 2 and 3). 3. These infected chicks carry the greatest numbers of S. senftenberg during first about 1 week of life, but so far as they are brooded under good feeding, management and sanitation, they remain healthy in appearance. They usually eliminate S. senftenberg from their bodies in 4 〜 6 weeks without therapeutic measures (Tables 6 and 7) and may be expected to exhibit no sequelae by S. senftenberg in future. 4. The regions where S. senftenberg lurks in baby chicks' bodies are the respiratory and digestive organs (Tables 6 and 7). 5. It is sure that S. senftenberg multiplies in <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments</b> of incubators working with normal temperature and humidity. However it is not yet proved what may bring, and how S. senftenberg is brought into the incubator for the first time. 6. As S. senftenberg contained in incubator is readily killed by formaldehyde gas, the <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments</b> of incubators should be cleansed and disinfected with the fumigation of formalin at intervals of 6 weeks after the beginning of hatching...|$|R
25|$|Russian Navy {{officials}} imposed specific {{constraints that}} restricted the Norwegians divers {{to work on}} the stern of the ship, specifically the escape <b>hatch</b> over <b>compartment</b> nine and an air control valve connected to the rescue trunk. The Norwegian deep-sea divers protested against the restrictions which they felt impeded their rescue operations.|$|R
2500|$|The salvage {{companies}} {{agreed that}} the Norwegian divers would cut {{the holes in the}} hull but only Russian divers would enter the submarine. The Norwegian divers cut a hole in the hull of the eighth compartment to gain access, using a cutting machine that shoots a high-velocity water-and-cutting-grit mix at [...] pressure. The Russian divers entered the wreck and opened a bulkhead <b>hatch</b> to <b>compartment</b> nine.|$|R
40|$|Definition of the problem: Imitated {{natural light}} {{conditions}} during the artificial incubation may influence pullets' behaviour in being {{adapted to the}} diurnal rhythm. Methodology: To study these effects, eggs were set in a commercial incubator either in the dark control or under full spectrum light tubes (Philips TL 95, 36 watt). To imitate the light changes by a clucking hen, the eggs were exposed to light for twelve hours a day with a light-intensity of 20 lux. After six hours there was a step-up in light intensity to 1000 lux for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, at day 18 of incubation, all eggs were transferred to the <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments.</b> After <b>hatching,</b> the chickens were reared in paired groups under Swiss organic standards. Each group, containing 1000 pullets, was observed {{at the age of}} 2, 4, 8 and 10 weeks in 5 trials. Several categories of behaviour, activity and the diurnal rhythm were observed (scan sampling). Hatchability per cent, mortality, weight and feather scoring at the age of 10 weeks were recorded. Results, conclusion, state of the art: There is no constant significance that light exposure during the incubation period affects the diurnal rhythm and behaviour of young laying hens. It seems to be, that the rearing conditions and management are still more important...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} involving 11, 400 commercial broiler {{parent stock}} hatching eggs of varying sizes, ages, and arrangements during incubation {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of fluorescent light (FL) on hatchability and on body weight at hatch. In Experiment 1, there were two trials {{for a total of}} 10 incubation trays (units) for lighted treatment as well as the control (nonlighted). All eggs within a trial were laid the same day and were of the same size. Incubation units (ISO eggs/unit) of each trial were distributed randomly in the lighted or nonlighted incubators. Experiment 2 used larger sized eggs that were collected for 4 consecutive days to make four independent age groups. Treatment units were positioned on the same level of incubators for lighted and nonlighted groups. In both experiments the only difference between lighted, which extended for 18 days, and nonlighted treatments was the installation of two cool white 40 W fluorescent tubes positioned at the ceiling of the illuminated incubators. After 18 days of incubation, incubated trays were transferred to <b>hatching</b> <b>compartments</b> either distributed randomly in the same hatcher (Experiment 1) or positioned {{as they were in the}} incubator (Experiment 2). No significant differences (P>. 05) in hatchability or body weight at hatch were found between the light treatment and the control.

5000|$|The 1970 {{redesign}} of the Sonett V4, named the Sonett III, was initially undertaken by Sergio Coggiola, but Gunnar A. Sjögren altered it {{to fit the}} existing chassis without expensive manufacturing-line changes. Hinged rear-window glass replaced the Sonett II/V4 rear <b>compartment</b> <b>hatch</b> door. With the mandate for a [...] "bulge-less" [...] hood, the engine compartment opening evolved into a small front popup panel, resulting in more limited access than in the Sonett V4. Extensive engine work required {{the removal of the}} entire front hood section.|$|R
5000|$|The payload was a CSM, {{serial number}} 017. This was a Block I design meant for systems testing, not the Block II {{spacecraft}} {{designed for use}} with the Lunar Module (LM) on the actual Moon landings. However, several significant Block II modifications were made for certification, since no all-up Block II spacecraft would fly without a crew. [...] The modifications included: a new CM heat shield outer covering; a new CM-to-SM umbilical connector; moving the VHF scimitar antennas from the CM to the SM; a new Unified S-band antenna; and a modified crew <b>compartment</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Once it was {{determined}} no one remained alive in the compartment, the compartment was sealed {{to cut off the}} supply of oxygen to the fire. However, by 0500 the next morning, so much pressure had increased in the compartment it forced the main <b>hatch</b> open. The <b>compartment</b> was re-sealed for another five hours, but when it was opened at 1030, the fire reflashed. The crew shut the hatch again for another hour. At 1130, the compartment was successfully ventilated and cooled enough to allow the crew to enter safely. Temporary repairs completed on 25 October, and S-37 headed to Mare Island for permanent repairs. On 19 December, she returned to duty at San Pedro, California.|$|R
50|$|The second series Fulvia Sport was {{launched}} at the 1970 Turin Motor Show. Changes included a 5-speed gearbox, revised suspension geometry, taller ride height, an alternator {{in place of}} the previous dynamo, a taller final drive compared to coupés, and wider tyres. The body was now all-steel, and seated 2+2 passengers. Some of the Zagato's most unusual features were lost: the bonnet was now hinged at the front, and the spare wheel <b>compartment</b> <b>hatch</b> was deleted.Several other changes set the second series apart from the first: new driving lights, side mirror moved from the wing to the door, larger bullet-shaped tail lights from the Peugeot 204, and stamped steel wheels without hubcaps.|$|R
50|$|On 16 August 2013, Yurchikhin {{performed}} {{his seventh}} spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. They first {{set up a}} Strela cargo boom on the Poisk module. Misurkin used the Strela boom to maneuver Yurchikhin with cables and Yurchikhin rerouted a cable connector and installed cables on the Zarya module. The cable work outside the station was to prepare the ISS for the planned arrival of the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) - Nauka. The spacewalk ended at seven hours, 29 minutes when the cosmonauts closed the Pirs docking <b>compartment</b> <b>hatch</b> and re-entered the space station. The spacewalk set a new Russian spacewalk record, eclipsing the old mark of seven hours and 16 minutes set by two cosmonauts outside the Mir space station in July 1990. However, the record held by Yurchikhin and Misurkin was soon eclipsed by cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky when they performed an eight hours, seven minutes spacewalk on 27 December 2013.|$|R
50|$|Floodability {{is reduced}} by {{dividing}} {{the volume of the}} hull into watertight compartments with decks and bulkheads (which also increase the strength of ships), use of double bottom (or double hull), and by other means. If a ship's hull is divided into watertight compartments, any flooding resulting from a breach of the hull can be contained in the compartments where the flooding occurs. In most case, the watertight compartments are fitted with a system of automatic doors, which can be triggered either remotely or locally as soon as flooding is detected (and early example of such as system was used on the RMS Titanic, which sank in spite of its watertight bulkheads). Smaller vessels and submarines generally feature watertight <b>hatches</b> between <b>compartments,</b> which are closed manually to block water from escaping the flooded compartment. As long as the flooding is localised, this can allow a ship to retain sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat, but if numerous compartments are opened to the sea, the ship can sink regardless. If a ship is fitted with longitudinal bulkheads (running fore and aft) as well as transverse bulkheads, flooding along one side of the ship can cause a serious list, which can threaten to capsize the vessel. In such cases, damage control parties can intentionally flood the corresponding compartment on the other side, equalizing the list (although this can happen in ships without longitudinal bulkheads, as well). Such techniques can work fore-and-aft as well, for example, if a flooded bow is holding the rudder and propellers out of the water.|$|R
