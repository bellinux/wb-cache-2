40|$|In {{the present}} {{modeling}} work, the gas-phase alkali sulfation process is investigated. The combined effects of oxyfuel combustion and co-combustion on the sulfation of alkali metals are examined and {{compared to the}} corresponding process under air-fired conditions. According to the modeling results, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> of gas-phase alkali metals is generally higher for oxy-fuel combustion than for air fuel combustion. The recirculation strategy, {{in terms of the}} flue gas composition in oxy-fuel combustion, is important for the sulfation of alkali metals. The increased contents of sulfur and water contribute significantly to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> of the alkali species. The modeling also reveals that an increased content of HCl, which is present during wet recirculation, has a negative effect on the sulfation. Thus, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> is lower in wet recirculation than in dry recirculation. The effects of other important parameters, such as the sulfur/potassium ratio, oxygen concentration, and temperature, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{characterization}} of sulfated glycans through mass spectrometry (MS) has been often limited by their low abundance in biological materials and inefficient ionization in the positive-ion mode. Here, we describe a microscale method for sequentially enriching sulfated glycans {{according to their}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation.</b> This method is based on modifying the binding ability of strong anion-exchange material {{through the use of}} different sodium acetate concentrations, thus enabling fairly selective binding and a subsequent elution of different glycans according to their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation.</b> Before this enrichment, the negative charge on the sialic acid, which is commonly associated with such glycans, was eliminated through permethylation that is used to enhance the positive-ion mode matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) signal for all glycans. This enrichment approach minimizes competitive ionization between sulfated and neutral glycans, as well as that between sulfated species with a different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation.</b> The described method was initially optimized using sulfated oligosaccharide standards, while its potential has been verified for the sulfated N-glycans originated from the bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (bTSH), a glycoprotein possessing mono- and disulfated N-glycans. This enhancement of the MALDI-MS signal facilitates analysis of some otherwise undetected components...|$|E
40|$|Heparin {{has been}} the drug of choice in {{clinical}} pre-surgical and post-surgical prophylaxis of thrombotic events. However, because of its side-effects, such as bleeding and other disadvantages (i. e. chemical inhomogeneity and variability of its physiological activities), alternatives to heparin are an important field of research. A necessary procedure {{in the development of}} new drugs is the evaluation of structure-activity relationships. Genuine neutral polysaccharides were chemically modified and examined for their anticoagulant activities. The linear beta- 1, 3 -glucan curdlan, an easily available bacterial polysaccharide, served as the basic polymer. It could be established that the anticoagulant activity was dependent on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> and the molecular weight. For heparin, the sulfation pattern, i. e. the actual location of the sulfate groups along the heparin chain, was of importance in addition to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation.</b> Therefore, we investigated whether there was also a relationship between the substitution pattern of the curdlan sulfates and their anticoagulant activity. For determination of the substitution pattern of the sulfated polysaccharides, a method was developed that is based on synthesis of the partially alkylated alditol acetates of the polymer and examination of these derivatives using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition to the analytical data, the structure-activity relationship of anticoagulative curdlan sulfates is presented...|$|E

Five sulfated derivatives of APS-W 1 with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> were prepared and they showed strong inhibitory effect on the complement activation through the classical pathway (CP 50 : 2. 2 – 18. 9 μg/mL; 8. 3 μg/mL for heparin) and alternative pathway (AP 50 : 11. 4 – 115. 8 μg/mL; 89. 2 μg/mL for heparin). Mechanism studies by using complement-depleted sera indicated that sulfated derivatives with different positions <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> targeted to different complement proteins.

The heparin-AT III dissociation constants were not appreciably affected {{by the presence of}} the metal ion, whereas the catalytic process was strongly dependent upon Ca 2 +. Our data suggest that AT III binding to heparin represents the main factor driving the FXa inhibition process.

The effects were shown {{to depend on the}} structural features of the compounds tested. Native fucoidan SL with a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> (DS) of 1. 3 was found to be the most active sample, fucoidan FV (DS 0. 9) demonstrated moderate activity, while the polysaccharide CO (DS 0. 4) was inactive in all performed experiments, even at high concentrations. Additional introduction of sulfate groups into fucoidan SL slightly decreased the anticoagulant effect of SL-S, while sulfation of CO, giving rise to the preparation CO-S, increased the activity dramatically. The high level of anticoagulant activity of polysaccharides SL, SL-S, and CO-S was explained by their ability to form ternary complexes with ATIII-Xa and ATIII-IIa, as well as to bind directly to thrombin. Synthetic per-O-sulfated octasaccharide OS showed moderate anticoagulant effect, determined mainly by the interaction of OS with the factor Xa in the presence of ATIII.

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that many {{mutations}} influence phenotypic variability as well as the mean, the underlying mechanisms for variability effects are very poorly understood. The brachymorph (bm) phenotype results from an autosomal recessive mutation in the phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate synthetase 2 gene (Papps 2). A major cranial manifestation is a dramatic reduction in the growth of the chondrocranium which results from undersulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the cartilage matrix. We found that this reduction in the growth of the chondrocranium is associated with an altered pattern of craniofacial shape variation, a significant increase in phenotypic variance and a dramatic increase in morphological integration for craniofacial shape. Both effects are largest in the basicranium. The altered variation pattern indicates that the mutation produces developmental influences on shape that are not present in the wildtype. As the mutation dramatically reduces sulfation of GAGs, we infer that this influence is variation among individuals in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation,</b> or variable expressivity of the mutation. This variation may be because of genetic variation at other loci that influence sulfation, environmental effects, or intrinsic effects. We infer that chondrocranial development exhibits greater sensitivity to variation in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate when the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> is low. At normal levels, sulfation probably contributes minimally to phenotypic variation. This case illustrates canalization in a particular developmental-genetic context...|$|E

The <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> were 0. 87 (chitosan-S 1) and 0. 67 (chitosan-S 2). FTIR spectra showed bands at 1230, 800 and 580 cm− 1, attributed to sulfation. Moisture content followed the order: chitosan-S- 0. 87 >chitosan-S- 0. 67 >chitosan. Chain depolymerization was verified by GPC. Aqueous solutions showed pseudoplastic behavior and the viscosity at a concentration of 0. 3 % (w/v) was higher than that of healthy human tears (close to 3 mPas at shear rate 130 s− 1). Substitutions in the C 2 NH and in C 6 OH groups were verified by NMR. Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed. Considering that chitosan-S- 0. 67 had a higher solubility, less chain depolymerization, higher yield and better thermal stability in comparison with chitosan-S- 0. 87, the derivative with DS 0. 67 offered the greatest potential for use in formulations of tear substitutes...|$|R

As such compounds are not known so far, the goal of this project was to identify and to synthesise lead-like compounds, to optimise the structures and to study the structure-activity relationships. Therefore, we applied the following strategies: structurally different oligosaccharides with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> were studied for inhibitory activity on the bovine testicular enzyme, the bacterial hyaluronidase and the hyaluronidase from bee venom. Furthermore, a series of substituted flavone derivatives was synthesised and investigated for inhibition of the bovin e testicular and the bacterial enzyme.

To address this, our laboratory has developed alternative synthetic strategies for HS-like oligosaccharides to incorporate either D-GlcA or L-IdoA in a synthetically efficient manner by nucleophilic ring opening of 4 -epoxypyranosides, which can be made from readily available D-hexoses in few steps.

As charged polymers, they do most likely influence lipid and protein dynamics {{in the outer}} leaflet of plasma membranes. In this study, we investigated their specific effect, depending on concentration, on lipid diffusion in model membranes. In our assay, GAGs are simply attached electrostatically to supported phospholipid (DOPC) bilayers doped with small amounts of cationic lipid (DOTAP) at physiological pH. Lipid dynamics are characterized via the diffusion of fluorescent lipid analogs (DiD/DiO), determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We find that diffusion of DiD is significantly affected by the attachment of GAG. Quite surprisingly, short chains (= 100 disaccharide units). In particular, short chains of hyaluronic acids at micromolar concentrations display a 2 -fold decrease of the diffusion coefficients compared to the situation without GAG. At nanomolar concentrations of hyaluronic acid of both short and long chains, DiD diffusion remains unaltered. In contrast, sulfated GAGs, such as heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin, affect the lipid diffusion already at sub-micromolar concentrations, albeit not as strongly, with a less than 1. 5 fold reduction of the diffusion coefficient. Chondroitin sulfate, another class of sulfated GAGs, did not impose any effect on DiD diffusion in the supported phospholipid bilayer at the concentrations studied. We also investigated desulfated heparin, to explore the role <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> and to compare its effect with HA.

In this study, selective chemical modification of the Escherichia coli K 5 capsular polysaccharide was used to generate a collection of sulfated K 5 derivatives with a backbone structure that mimics the heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthetic precursor. The screening of a series of N-sulfated (K 5 -NS), O-sulfated (K 5 -OS), and N,O-sulfated (K 5 -N,OS) derivatives with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> revealed the highly sulfated K 5 derivatives K 5 -N,OS(H) and K 5 -OS(H) to be inhibitors of RSV. Their 50 % inhibitory concentrations were between 1. 07 nM and 3. 81 nM in two different cell lines, and no evidence of cytotoxicity was observed. Inhibition of RSV infection was maintained in binding and attachment assays but not in preattachment assays. Moreover, antiviral activity was also evident when the K 5 derivatives were added postinfection, both in cell-to-cell spread and viral yield reduction assays. Finally, both K 5 -N,OS(H) and K 5 -OS(H) prevented RSV infection in human-derived tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells cultured to form a pseudostratified, highly differentiated model of the epithelial tissue of the human respiratory tract. Together, these features put K 5 -N,OS(H) and K 5 -OS(H) forward as attractive candidates for further development as RSV inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} sulfated alumina {{catalysts}} were synthesised by wet impregnation with sulfate-containing solutions. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>sulfation</b> and corresponding surface acidity could be readily tuned by varying the molarity of impregnating solution. Strong acid treatments (> 0. 1 M) induced aluminium-sulfate crystallisation with a concomitant decrease in porosity and surface acidity. Platinum-doped sulfated aluminas showed enhanced activity towards methane, ethane and propane combustion. Activity scaled with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> accessible surface sulfate and platinum loading, however C-H bond scission appeared rate-limiting over both pure and presulfated aluminas. The magnitude of sulfate-promoted propane oxidation was greatest under heavily oxidising conditions (C 3 H 6 ∶O 2 > 1 : 20) but independent of Pt loading, confirming that support-mediated alkane activation {{is the dominant}} factor in the promotional mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Heparin is a linear, {{water-soluble}} glycosaminoglycan containing numerous {{negatively charged}} groups. It {{is widely used}} in the internal and post-operative medicine as an antithrombotic drug to prevent thromboembolism. In addition to its specific interactions with components of the coagulation system, heparin has numerous side effects which are poorly understood but can give rise to serious problems in heparin treatment. Among these side effects are inhibition of inflammation, tumor propagation and fat resorption and regulatory effects on bone and lipid metabolism. In spite of its water solubility heparin is to more than 95 % attached to membranes thereby altering their properties, e. g. heparin bound to endothelial cells can reduce the attachment of thrombocytes thereby reducing thrombus formation. Commercially available heparin is highly heterogeneous in respect to carbohydrate monomer composition and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> or N-acetylation of the polymer. In an attempt to elucidate the acti on of heparin we use heparin degrading enzymes from different microorganisms newly isolated from soil and water samples from Europe and Asia for fragmentation of heparin into defined fragments. To investigate the heparin degradation qualitatively and to determine the activities of purified enzymes we have developed a convenient isotachophoresis technique. This method allows characterization of heparin and degradation products by means of conductivity and UV-absorbance of the products. Isotachophoresis was performed at pH 4, 2 where sulphate groups are negatively charged and carboxylate groups are largely uncharged so that the relative conductivity is a measure for the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> of a fragment. From the UV-absorption at 254 nm the presence of double bonds, indicative of lyase activity, can be derived. With these analytical techniques at hand new enzyme activities for heparin cleavage were detected in these organisms. Also various highly sulfated homogeneous heparin fragments ar...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSulfation of {{tyrosine}} residues {{is a key}} posttranslationalmodification in {{the regulation}} of various cellular processes. As such, the detection and localization of tyrosine sulfation is an essential step toward the elucidation of the physiological and pathological roles of this process. Despite substantial advances, intact sulfated peptides are still difficult to detect by MALDI-MS due to the extreme lability of the sulfo-moiety. The present report demonstrates {{for the first time}} how intact sulfated peptides can be directly and specifically detected by MALDI-MS in positive reflectronmode by using pyrenemethylguanidine (pmg) as a noncovalent derivatizing agent and an ionization enhancer. This new method allows the determination of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> of sulfopeptides pure or in mixtures. Moreover, the observation of specific peaks in the mass spectra enables a rapid and unambiguous discrimination between phospho- and sulfopeptides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe small {{proteoglycan}} decorin {{plays an}} important role in the organisation of the extracellular matrix by binding to several components, including collagen and fibronectin. In this work, we report the dose-dependent and saturable interaction of decorin with the adhesive glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (VWF). This interaction was mediated by the glycosaminoglycan side chain of decorin and was critically regulated by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation,</b> but not by the amount of iduronic acid. Both chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, in addition to heparin, were found to bind VWF equally well. Although soluble decorin prevented VWF binding to heparin, purified VWF-A 1 domain failed to interact with the proteoglycan. These results identify VWF as a new partner for the small proteoglycan, decorin, in the structural organisation of the extracellular matrix...|$|E
40|$|Antiviral microbicides, topical {{agents that}} prevent sexually {{transmitted}} infections, mainly work by blocking {{the interaction between}} viral proteins and cell surface components. In many instances, virus–cell interaction is mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs are exploited as attachment receptors by three sexually transmitted viruses: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Since these viruses can either infect or co-infect humans, virus/HSPGs interaction is a preferential target {{for the development of}} wide-spectrum antiviral microbicides. Several polyanionic compounds prevent HIV, HSV and HPV infections in cell culture models by acting as heparan sulfate (HS) -antagonists. However, three promising polyanionic compounds recently failed to pass phase III clinical trials designed to establish their efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition. In this scenario, new polyanionic compounds must be added to the pipeline of candidate microbicides and their development as effective drugs reconsidered. The capsular K 5 polysaccharide from Escherichia coli has the same structure as the heparin/HS biosynthetic precursor. Chemical and enzymatic modifications have led to the synthesis of K 5 derivatives with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> and charge distribution and devoid of anticoagulant activity and cell toxicity. Recently attracting attention as candidate microbicides, they potently inhibit a broad spectrum of HIV- 1 strains and genital types of HPV and HSV- 1 and 2 in vitro. With a focus on the K 5 derivatives, this article reviews the literature on polyanions as antiviral microbicides and discusses the possible therapeutic implications of this novel class of compounds...|$|R
40|$|Dermatan sulfate (DS) {{widespread}} as {{a component}} of extracellular matrix proteoglycans, is characterized by great bio-reactivity and remarkable structural heterogeneity due to distinct <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sulfation</b> and glucuronosyl epimerization and different polymerization degrees. However, DS metabolism under various biological conditions is poorly known. Dupuytren’s contracture is a benign fibromatosis leading to complex remodeling of the palmar fascia structure and properties. However, it remains unclear whether the disease affects the structure of DS, which is the major tissue glycosaminoglycan. Thus the aim {{of the study was to}} examine the structure of the total DS in Dupuytren’s fascia. DS chains were extracted from 5 samples of normal fascia and 7 specimens of Dupuytren’s tissue by papain digestion followed by fractionation with cetylpyridinium chloride. Then, DS structure analysis was performed comprising the evaluation of its molecular masses and sensitivity to hyaluronidase and chondroitinase B. Dupuytren’s contracture is associated with significant remodeling of DS chain structure revealed by (1) a distinct profile of chain molecular masses characterized by the appearance of long size components as well as the increase in the content of small size chains; (2) a different glucuronosyl epimerization pattern connected with the enhanced content of glucuronate disaccharide blocks; (3) chain oversulfation. These structural alterations in total DS may modify the GAG interactions especially affecting collagen fibrillogenesis and growth factor availability. Thus, Dupuytren’s contracture associated DS remodeling may promote the phenomena typical for advanced disease: apoptosis and reduction in cell number as well as the appearance of dense pseudotendinous collagen matrix.
