5|$|These guns fired {{two types}} of shells during World War I: armor-piercing (AP) L/3.1 and <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> (HE) L/4 types. During World War II, the guns fired {{a wider variety of}} shells, {{including}} armor-piercing L/3,4 and L/4,9 types, and <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> L/3.8, L/5, and L/4.8 shells, as well as specially designed coast defense artillery projectiles. The AP and HE rounds weighed between 405 and 415kg (915lb), while the coastal artillery projectiles weighed only 250kg (551lb).|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Labrador Battery guns {{had limited}} effect {{during the battle}} and the rounds {{allocated}} to it were more armour-piercing cartridges rather than <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> rounds which were more effective against the infantry. As a result, these guns were ineffective and saw little action during the Battle of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.|$|E

5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E
5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} <b>High</b> <b>Explosive</b> Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} assault, C Company, located to the south, had {{uncovered}} a second bunker system which was subsequently {{captured by the}} Australians after being hastily abandoned. More than 16,000 rounds of M60 ammunition had been fired during the fighting, along with 6,000 rounds of M16 ammunition. The artillery had fired over 1,453 rounds of 105mm and 200 rounds of 155mm <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> in support. Over the next six days Australian pioneer and engineer demolition teams proceeded to destroy the remaining bunkers.|$|E

5|$|<b>High</b> <b>Explosive</b> Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This decision {{was taken by}} a cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{the town}} gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{was dominated by}} the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst of the bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> bombs fell on the town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.|$|E
5|$|In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF {{were used}} {{extensively}} during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting {{to overthrow the}} Federation of South Arabia. SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> rockets and 30mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.|$|E

5|$|The {{interrogation}} of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in Germany, mostly at the Auergesellschaft plant at Oranienburg, so Groves {{arranged for the}} plant to be bombed on 15 March 1945. Some 612 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Eighth Air Force dropped 1,500 tons of <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> and 178 tons of incendiary bombs on the plant.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{which had}} been subject to {{structural}} neglect prior to World War II, suffered extensive bomb damage and was hit by several incendiary devices which damaged the roof. A <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> also hit platform 8. The original glass roof had been removed before the war {{in an attempt to}} save it; however, the factory in which the roof was stored was itself badly bombed, destroying the roof.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called <b>High</b> <b>Explosive</b> Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain had {{a nuclear}} weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943. Many of Britain's top {{scientists}} participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed <b>High</b> <b>Explosive</b> Research. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology. In July 1954, Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chiswick {{was bombed}} repeatedly, with both {{incendiary}} and <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel also caused damage. The first V-2 rocket to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by the rocket {{and many more}} suffered damage. There is a memorial where the rocket fell on Staveley Road, and a War Memorial at {{the east end of}} Turnham Green.|$|E

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|In June, the {{division}} was withdrawn into reserve to conduct training exercises for the Ypres offensive. Replicas of the German positions on Pilckem Ridge were built and attacks rehearsed. On 20 July, {{the division}} {{returned to the}} front taking over from the 29th Division. Until {{the end of the}} month, the division was subjected to German artillery fire. These shells, a mixture of <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> and mustard gas, inflicted serious losses. At the same time, aerial reconnaissance and infantry patrols by the division confirmed that the British preliminary barrage had forced the Germans back to their second line positions.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
