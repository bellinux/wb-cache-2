5|$|To promote The Rocketeer, Disney made tie-in {{endorsements}} with Pizza Hut and M's/Mars candies. An extensive {{product line}} followed of computer games, toys, posters, trading cards, pins, patches, buttons, T-shirts, and children's clothing, licensed {{to coincide with}} the film's opening. The studio also spent a further $19 million on TV advertising alone. A television special documentary, titled The Rocketeer: <b>Excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Air, was broadcast on the Disney Channel in June 1991. That same month, a young adult novelization written by Peter David was published by Bantam Books, while a similar novelization by Ron Fontes, for younger readers was published by Scholastic Books for Disney Press.|$|E

5|$|Further {{expansion}} moves {{were also}} made in other global markets during 2012. The African market saw a new agreement with Grand Parade Investments of South Africa to enter Africa's largest economy, with restaurants opening in 2013. In Europe, Burger King {{returned to the}} French market in 2012 with an agreement with multinational operator Autogrill, a move that has met with some <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. The chain left the country in 1997, closing its 22 franchised and 17 corporate locations after a poorly executed entry into the market that left it unable to compete against McDonald's and local chain Quick. The partnership with Autogrill is a move to consolidate Burger King's presence in travel plazas along major highways in France, Italy, Poland and other European nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} on Whit Monday, 16 May 1921, by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), with Lutyens in attendance. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue {{gave a speech}} in which he estimated that 11,600 {{men and women from}} Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street hung out banners with welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.|$|E
5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!” Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign.|$|E

50|$|In 1851 Captain Ellbridge G. Reed {{built and}} started a hotel near where the creek now known as Reeds Creek enters the Sacramento River and {{conducted}} it with great success for years. Being {{at the head of}} navigation, Red Bluff soon forged ahead, and during <b>the</b> early mining <b>excitements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern mines was a great staging town, and did an immense amount of transhipping and teaming of goods.

25|$|The first {{fatalities}} of the North and South in the American Civil War {{occurred in}} Alexandria. Within {{a month of}} the Battle of Fort Sumter, where two died, Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops {{at the base of}} King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the New York Fire Zouaves, Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large Confederate flag displayed {{on the roof of the}} Marshall House Inn that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was shot dead by Captain James W. Jackson, the hotel's proprietor. One of the Ellsworth's soldier immediately killed Jackson. Ellsworth was publicized as a Union martyr, and the incident generated great <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, with many children being named for him. Jackson's death defending his home caused a similar, though less lasting sensation, in the South.|$|E

25|$|University Chancellor Wesley Posvar {{took action}} {{to revive the}} {{football}} program and hired Johnny Majors from Iowa State to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7–7. The <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city was palpable as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6–5–1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. The stage was thus set for the 1976 edition of the Panthers {{to make a run}} for the National Championship.|$|E
25|$|The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples), {{founded in}} 1804, joined with other Canadian {{branches}} in 1832, {{and the first}} work of the Christian Disciples of Evangelical Christian Church to form was in 1810 in Stratford, PEI, in the Maritime provinces Canada. The oldest Christian Disciples Church in Canada was founded in 1810 by John R. Stewart, an immigrant from Perthshire, Scotland. The first Meeting House was a log cabin built in 1813. From 1907 to 1947, the church was operated as a Baptist charge in conjunction with Scottish Baptist churches in Alexandra and Hazelbrook, when it apparently again became an Evangelical Christian Church. After the Second World War, a collaboration between an All-Canadian and North American (Evangelical Christian Church) Movement began {{as a way to}} coordinate and unite the various churches of the Restoration Movement in order to reform the church along non-sectarian, non-creedal lines. Several church bodies identifying with the Stone-Campbell movement were very creedal and range from ultra-conservative to ultra-liberal {{as can be seen in}} the United Church of Christ which is an attempt to unite all Christian denominations into one national body. In the beginning of the early 1940s, this movement organized a Great Western revival meeting, causing an increase in religious interest and <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Evangelical Christian Church, unifying Christians based on their interpretations of New Testament principles.|$|E
25|$|Chivas has {{developed}} two important rivalries over the years. Perhaps its most intense rivalry is with Mexico City-based Club América. Their meetings, {{which have become}} known as El Súper Clásico, are played {{at least twice a}} year and signal a national derby. Both are the most successful and most popular teams in Mexico. The first confrontation between them ended with a victory for Guadalajara with a score of 3–0.The rivalry began to flourish after the second match when Club América defeated Guadalajara with a score of 7–2. Although the huge defeat sparked embarrassment within Chivas, it was almost two decades before the rivalry became The Clásico. One of the very reasons why these two teams are archrivals is because in 1983 and 1986 they brawled with each other, raising excitement among the fans. Thus, every time they play it is considered a match that everyone will remember. To this day, El Clásico de Clásicos continues to raise huge <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole country as well as {{in other parts of the}} world where there are fans of either team. The intensity of the game is lived so passionately that every time these two teams play a game, regardless of what position they are in on the charts or what level they show throughout the league, it is always considered the most important game of the season. El Súper Clásico was ranked 12th on FourFourTwo's 50 biggest derbies list.|$|E

500|$|Anti-Texas Whig legislators {{had lost}} more than the White House in the general {{election}} of 1844. In the southern states of Tennessee and Georgia, Whig strongholds in the 1840 general election, voter support dropped precipitously due to the pro-annexation <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deep South – and Clay lost every Deep South state to Polk. Northern Whigs' uncompromising hostility to slavery expansion increasingly characterized the party, and southern members, by association, had suffered from charges of being [...] "soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery" [...] by Southern Democrats. Facing congressional and gubernatorial races in 1845 in their home states, a number of Southern Whigs sought to erase that impression with respect to the Tyler-Texas bill.|$|E
