500|$|The {{album was}} not commercially {{successful}} in the UK. A Record Mirror review said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> complete ignorance of precisely what Van der Graaf Generator are trying to achieve", though Melody Maker were more enthusiastic, saying [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] {{is one of the}} most fascinating and dramatic items I've ever heard". However, the album reached number one on the Italian album charts.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that my list of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely {{as simple as it}} seems: This is a recent hit song whose title is dominated by the words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé's {{mother and}} {{designer}} Tina Knowles, House of Deréon, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Elie Saab and Herve Leger {{served as the}} designers for the outfits of the tour. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee. Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as [...] "spangly". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the tinfoil mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a [...] "glittering goddess in a revealing outfit". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering." [...] John Aizlewood of the Daily Mail described the fashion as [...] "majestic". Gordon Smart from the newspaper The Sun praised the [...] "sexy costumes" [...] like the silvery dresses worn by Knowles and added that [...] "her audiences certainly haven't had a bum deal". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "the camouflage outfits her male dancers sometimes wore... felt right for a show that sometimes seemed like a military operation, expertly executed." [...] Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] and added, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger in my memory for years to come." [...] A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a [...] "silver-clad siren rose" [...] further saying that [...] "it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room". Tonya Turner from The Courier-Mail praised Knowles for looking [...] "every bit the dream girl in a sparkling silver floorlength gown".|$|E

All I have done is call for justice for my son’s death. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that, {{after so many years}} of waiting, I had lost faith; I never thought we would reach this point. Now I feel a great deal of contentment and of satisfaction. I always knew what had happened. Badalamenti used to call my husband Luigi to complain about Peppino, and my husband begged him not to kill the boy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Observers {{issue of}} 1 May 1938, [...] "Torquemada" [...] (Edward Powys Mathers) said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> I {{have just been}} beaten again by Agatha Christie. There was no excuse. I was feeling in {{particularly}} good form; and {{the worst of it}} is that she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone else would be insolent severity. Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, we might as well be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her Cards on the Table triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns." ...|$|E
