40|$|There is {{a lively}} {{debate in the}} {{literature}} on reflective processes and on the necessity to view them as consisting with differing levels of complexity. Within a semiotic and psychodynamic perspective, we present a conceptualization on reflective processes which distinguishes between reflection and reflectivity and articulates their relationship with narrative devices. The study analyzes 224 narratives of critical events written by 77 underachieving university students that took part in <b>group</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> during the INSTALL European project. The corpus was subjected to a qualitative analysis of narrative function, with the aim of detecting narrative functions of reflection, reflectivity and agency, the latter being considered as an interconnected construct to the reflective process. The functions were discussed both on the basis of how the narrators reacted to the discontinuity in their self-image caused by the critical event, and based upon different types of narrative coherence (chronological, causal, thematic, autobiographical). The results highlighted that narratives with a reflection function, attribute the discontinuity generated by the event to the self, and show a causal coherence; those whose function is reflectivity interpret the discontinuity attributing it to the self in relation to others and present a thematic coherence; those of agency ascribe the discontinuity to a potential selves in action, and are characterized by an autobiograph- ical coherence. The implications of the study will be discussed with reference to the value of narrative writing in promoting reflective-agentive processes...|$|E

Participants were allocated a place on established <b>group</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> that taught flexible intensive insulin treatment (“dose adjustment for normal eating,” DAFNE). The course groups (the clusters) were then randomly allocated in pairs to either pump or multiple daily injections. Interventions: Participants attended training in flexible insulin treatment (using insulin analogues) structured around the use of pump or injections, followed for two years. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were a change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) values (%) at two years in participants with baseline HbA 1 c value of ≥ 7. 5 % (58  mmol/mol), and the proportion of participants achieving an HbA 1 c value of < 7. 5 %. Secondary outcomes included body weight, insulin dose, and episodes of moderate and severe hypoglycaemia. Ancillary outcomes included quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Results: 317 participants (46 courses) were randomised (156 pump and 161 injections). 267 attended courses and 260 were included in the intention to treat analysis, of which 235 (119 pump and 116 injection) had baseline HbA 1 c values of ≥ 7. 5 %. Glycaemic control and rates of severe hypoglycaemia improved in both groups. The mean change in HbA 1 c at two years was − 0. 85 % with pump treatment and − 0. 42 % with multiple daily injections. Adjusting for course, centre, age, sex, and accounting for missing values, the difference was − 0. 24 % (− 2. 7 mmol/mol) in favour of pump users (95 % confidence interval − 0. 53 to 0. 05, P= 0. 10). Most psychosocial measures showed no difference, but pump users showed greater improvement in treatment satisfaction and some quality of life domains (dietary freedom and daily hassle) at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions: Both groups showed clinically relevant and long lasting decreases in HbA 1 c, rates of severe hypoglycaemia, and improved psychological measures, although few participants achieved glucose levels currently recommended by national and international guidelines. Adding pump treatment to structured training in flexible intensive insulin treatment did not substantially enhance educational benefits on glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, or psychosocial outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes. These results do not support a policy of providing insulin pumps to adults with poor glycaemic control until the effects of training on participants’ level of engagement in intensive self management have been determined...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{compilation}} of abstracts of MSc theses by ILRI graduate fellows during 2006 – 07. The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is one of 15 future harvest centres, which conduct food and environmental research to help alleviate poverty and increase food security while protecting the natural resource base. Building on three decades of experience, ILRI works {{at the crossroads of}} livestock and poverty by bringing high quality science and capacity building to bear on poverty reduction and sustainable development. As part of its research-based outreach and capacity strengthening, ILRI assists its partners by offering opportunities for long- and short-term training for researchers and development practitioners. Capacity building is a core priority of ILRI because of the important role it plays in economic growth and development as well as addressing the rapid changes in the bio-physical, socio-cultural, technological and policy environments of the agricultural innovation systems in the developing as well as the developed world. ILRI offers individual and <b>group</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> Both are aimed at largely building the capacity of the individual. Individual training is focused on harnessing the skills and abilities of individuals to contribute to the realization of developmental goals, which may include improved livestock management systems and enhanced research outputs and outcomes. ILRI has five categories of individual trainees: Attachment Associates, Student Associates, Technical Associates, Research Fellows and Graduate Fellows. Graduate Fellows are mostly employees undertaking MSc and PhD studies. Postgraduate training is a priority activity of ILRI as it contributes significantly to the research agenda of ILRI and to the national and regional human resource pool in many regions of the world. This group of graduates will continue the research on emerging issues and will form the core of future collaborative research and innovation partners of ILRI. ILRI supports a number of Graduate Fellows every year. The outputs of their work would end up as thesis and various publications. Not every researcher, however, has access to these materials. The result of the research efforts of the Graduate Fellows have limited impact due to lack of wider circulation of their findings. This publication of the abstracts of the thesis work supported iv by ILRI as a compendium is one way {{to make sure that the}} results are widely distributed among the various research and development practitioners working within the livestock innovation system. The purpose is to make the R&D community to be aware of the research work completed and the key findings. If you need additional information, please contact ILRI’s InfoCentre directly where copies of these theses are deposited. We sincerely hope that this document will contribute positively in planning the future research activities and also will eliminate potential duplication of efforts...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{workers in}} {{countries}} with advanced industrial economies are required to engage in continuing work-related learning to maintain their occupational competence and employability. Learning at and through work is now seen to be central a means of achieving the individual and enterprise specific goals. This is partially because different social practices generate and support the appropriation of knowledge in distinct ways to suit situationally relevant purposes. Essentially, knowledge requirements are shaped by local "rules, values, attitudes, expectations etc" (Ellstrom, Svesson and Aberg, 2004, p. 479) and the material, social, discursive and historical conditions and relations of work contexts (Kemmis, 2005). This appropriation requires personal reflection and collaboration with other workers and interlocutors (e. g. clients). These aspects of learning in the workplace signify the valuable contributions of workplaces as potentially rich sites to support this continuous learning. Studies informed by empirical evidence s (e. g. by Eraut et al., 1998; Collin, 2002; Billett, 2004, 2009; Fuller and Unwin, 2004) have confirmed workplaces as legitimate sites for occupational learning. Yet, although the workplaces are known as rich, potent, authentic sites and afford a range of opportunities for learning, learning is neither inherent nor is necessarily organised in educationally purposeful ways. However, specific and targeted pedagogical interventions can lead to more effective learning. Sawchuk (2010), for instance, contends that workplace learning needs to extend beyond "simply individual, taught, self-directed learning, but that learning also includes formal, non-formal, informal and tacit aspects, experiential and incidental learning, reflective learning, legitimate peripheral participation, and learning "activity" (p. 369). Such a multi-faceted view of learning through work settings supports Billett's (2006, 2009) notion of 'situated learning' that leads to diverse sets of outcomes. It therefore becomes important to make visible the types of workplace pedagogies that will best support workers' learning. This paper reports how 136 Australian workers from four industry sectors claimed they are currently learning through work and how they prefer to secure the continuous learning required for their work. These data were premised on indications of what kinds of learning experiences they engaged in and how that learning was supported by particular pedagogic practices. They report the three most common ways that they learn in the workplace are: i) Everyday learning through work (individually); ii) Everyday learning through work individually - assisted by other workers; and iii) Everyday learning + <b>group</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> at work from employer. And three most common means for supporting that learning are: i) Direct teaching by a workplace expert; ii) Learning in a self-managed group in the workplace with a facilitator; and iii) Direct teaching in a group (e. g. a trainer in a classroom at work). The findings indicate the types of pedagogies that enterprises need to make visible to workers to assist them with continuing education and training. The analysis offers comparisons across these industry sectors and begins to set out what kinds of practices can support workers' continuous worklife learning.

In this controlled trial among GPs who attended a two-year Palliative Care Peer <b>Group</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Course</b> in the Netherlands only intervention GPs received the ACA training programme. To evaluate the effect of the programme a content analysis (Roter Interaction Analysis System) was performed of one videotaped 15 -minute consultation of each GP with a simulated palliative care patient conducted at baseline, and one at 12 months follow-up. Both how the GP communicated with the patient ('availability') and the number of current and anticipated issues the GP discussed with the patient were measured quantitatively. We used linear mixed models and logistic regression models to evaluate between-group differences over time. Results: Sixty-two GPs were assigned to the intervention and 64 to the control group. We found no effect of the ACA training programme on how the GPs communicated with the patient or on the number of issues discussed by GPs with the patient. The total number of issues discussed by the GPs was eight out of 13 before and after the <b>training</b> in both <b>groups.</b> Conclusion: The ACA training programme did not influence how the GPs communicated with the simulated palliative care patient or the number of issues discussed by the GPs in this trial. Further research should evaluate whether this training programme is effective for GPs who do not have a special interest in palliative care and whether studies using outcomes at patient level can provide more insight into the effectiveness of the ACA training programme.

40|$|Executive Summary This report synthesises key {{messages}} for policy-makers and service managers and commissioners about interventions to improve children’s behaviour, based on evaluations of 9 programmes {{that have been}} funded through the Parenting and Early Intervention Initiative in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The programmes include <b>group</b> -based parent <b>training</b> <b>courses,</b> classroom management <b>training</b> for teachers, a whole- school approach to promoting children’s social and emotional learning, an early childhood care and education project, after school and community mentoring programmes, and a home based early intervention programme designed to support families from pregnancy until their child starts school. Information from other programmes within the Initiative which include improving children’s behaviour among their objectives {{will be added to}} this report as it becomes available. This is {{one of a series of}} reports on what can be learned from the Initiative about influencing different aspects of children’s developmen...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} in order to survey effects of relaxation on daily life quality of Migraine patients. The method applied {{for this study was}} semi-experimental and also clinical. We asked 28 migraine patients of Zahedan city to participate in our survey. We used random sampling method and divided patients into two groups. First group was the engaging group and the other one was the observing group. Then we organized a one week Relaxation <b>training</b> <b>course</b> for the engaging group. This course has been carried out in three sessions, each of them 2 h of class while the observing <b>group</b> received no <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Thereafter, life quality of both groups are measured and compared with the early days of experiment, six weeks after the beginning of the experiments and finally twelve weeks after the initiation of the survey. The final phase of survey has been evaluated by life quality measuring questionnaires and SF 36 has been extracted. Then for the last step, data are analyzed by SPSS. According to Independent t-test, average grade for life quality of both groups didn’t have a significant difference but after the survey (application of training for one of groups), we could see a significant difference. Also after analyzing Anoa Test, we could see a significant difference in life quality average grade of each phase of survey. Relaxation <b>training</b> <b>course</b> was helpful for enhancing life quality of Migraine patients...|$|R
