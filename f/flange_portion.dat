40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{is made to}} know the effect of working axial compression on the reductionof load carrying capacity of interior beam-to-column connection in steel reinforced concrete frames. Experimental variable is the ratio of applied axial compression to the ultimate compressive strength. Main discussion is concentrated on the shear strength, failure mechanism, strain history of webpanel and <b>flange</b> <b>portion</b> and hysteretic characteristics involved in the large deformation range undermonotonic and repeated loading. It is concluded that the load carrying capacity of beam-to-columnconnection {{that is supposed to}} fail in shear is hardly affected by magnitude of axial compressionon colum...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel {{technique}} on friction aided {{deep drawing}} using tapered blank holder divided into eight segments is proposed to overcome defect of friction aided deep drawing using four segments tapered blank holder technique. A taper blank holder {{is designed to}} be of two parts: stationary part with 5 degree taper angle and moving parts divided into eight tapered segments. The main function of this tapered blank holder device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder segments to work in the useful drawing direction. At first, the drawing mechanism of eight segments tapered blank holder technique and inflow of material in the <b>flange</b> <b>portion</b> of blank are investigated and compared with four segments tapered blank holder technique by ABAQUS software to show the merits of the proposed process. Then, the finite element analysis of springback is investigated by the ABAQUS software. Effect of different process parameters such as initial blank thickness, punch profile radius, blank holder force, friction coefficient and hardening models on springback prediction are studied. A successful deep cup with drawing ratio up to 3. 67 can b...|$|E
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in the NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. To meet a more challenging set of requirements than previous suit systems standard design features, such as threaded inserts, have been re-analyzed and improved. NASA's Z- 2 prototype space suit contains several components fabricated from an advanced hybrid composite laminate consisting of IM 10 carbon fiber and fiber glass. One requirement NASA levied on the suit composites was the ability to have removable, replaceable helicoil inserts to which other suit components would be fastened. An approach utilizing bonded in inserts with helicoils inside of them was implemented. The design of the interface flanges of the composites allowed some of the inserts to be a "T" style insert that was installed through the entire thickness of the laminate. The <b>flange</b> <b>portion</b> of the insert provides a mechanical lock as a redundancy to the adhesive aiding in the pullout load that the insert can withstand. In some locations {{it was not possible to}} utilize at "T" style insert and a blind insert was used instead. These inserts rely completely on the bond strength of the adhesive to resist pullout. It was determined during the design of the suit that the inserts did not need to withstand loads induced from pressure cycling but instead tension induced from torqueing the screws to bolt on hardware which creates a much higher stress on them. Bolt tension is determined by dividing the torque on the screw by a k value multiplied by the thread diameter of the bolt. The k value is a factor that accounts for friction in the system. A common value used for k for a non-lubricated screw is 0. 2. The k value can go down by as much as 0. 1 if the screw is lubricated which means for the same torque, a much larger tension could be placed on the bolt and insert. This paper summarizes testing that was performed to determine a k value for helicoil inserts in the Z 2 suit and how the insert design was modified to resist a higher pull out tension...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of bending behavior of cold-formed steel profiles is studied. The {{purpose of the}} study was to estimate the influence of section parameters - flange width and size of the wall portion, adjacent to the flange – on {{effectiveness of}} the operation of flexural element consisting of two Sigma sections. As a criterion of effectiveness it was accepted the ratio of maximum bending moment available in the zone of elastic behavior of the section to its area reflecting the material consumption. Effective section characteristics are calculated in accordance with Eurocode 3. It was taken into account the local buckling parts of section and distortional buckling. Variable parameters are: <b>flange</b> width and <b>portion</b> of the wall adjacent to the flange. Calculations were executed by computer program CFSteel. Analysis of obtained results is presented...|$|R
30|$|The use of high {{strength}} concrete (HSC, i.e. concrete compressive strength f_c^' > 55 MPa) has gained wide acceptance in the PC industry. Standardization {{in the design}} and manufacturing of the precast bridges has been optimized. Bridge superstructure elements such as the PC I-beams, double tee and box beams are generally plant-produced precast and PC products inheriting the advantages of durability, economy, low maintenance and assured quality. The most commonly used precast/PC beam for short-to-medium-spans is the I-beam. An I-beam consists of a top and a bottom flanges with a slender web joining the flanges. The bottom <b>flange</b> and some <b>portion</b> of the web-bottom are reinforced with prestressing strands (tendons); thus the bottom and top flanges build up the flexural strength. The web is reinforced with vertical/transverse deformed reinforcing bars (rebars), referred to as stirrups, which contributes towards the shear strength of the beam.|$|R
40|$|Composite beam E Elastic and inelastic {{behaviours}} E Elasto-plastic stress–strain curve E Neutral axis E Strain compatibility Structural composite hybrid beams {{consist of}} a rolled wide-flange steel shaped to allow the bottom <b>flange</b> and/or a <b>portion</b> of the web of the steel section partially encased in pre-cast concrete. For each limit state, a series of plastic strain distributions corresponding to a particular location of the neutral axis and stresses in the reinforcing steel and steel section was assumed. For the assumed strain distributions, equations were derived based on equilibrium equations and solved for the neutral axis and stress levels in the concrete block, the reinforcing steels and the steel section. The calculated stress levels in the structural components were com-pared with the assumed stresses obtained from the assumed strain distribution. The strain compatibility approach allows for analytical calculations that corre-late well, thus avoiding the need for complex and tedious calculations of the flexural moment capacity for complex structures. In this work, Green Beam and steel beam with the same flexural moment capacity were compared {{and the ability of}} the Green Beam to reduce CO 2 emissions was demonstrated...|$|R
