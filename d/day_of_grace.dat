6000|$|Answ. Truly, {{with some}} men indeed it doth fare thus, that the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> {{is at an}} end before their lives are at end.

Cain, after this, was lord {{of a city}} (Gen 4:17). Ishmael was, after this, father of twelve princes (Gen 25:16). And Esau, after this, told his brother, 'I have enough, my brother, keep that thou hast unto thyself' (Gen 33:8,9). Ease and peace, and a prosperous life in outwards, {{is no sign of}} the favour of God to a barren and fruitless professor, but rather of his wrath; that thereby he may be capable to {{treasure}} up more wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.

60|$|Now, in my {{handling}} of this point, I shall {{discourse of the}} cutting down, or the judgment here denounced, as it respecteth the doing of it by God's hand immediately, and that too with respect to his casting {{them out of the}} world, and not as it respecteth an act of the church, &c. And as to this cutting down, or judgment, it must be concluded, that it cannot be before the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> be past with the fig-tree; but according to the observation, there are some professors whose <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> will end with, Cut it down; and according to the words of the text, 'Then,' after that, 'thou shalt cut it down.' 'After that,' that is, after all my attempts and endeavours to make it fruitful, after I have left it, given it over, done with it, and have resolved to bestow no more days of grace, opportunities of grace, and means of grace upon it, then, 'after that,' thou shalt cut it down.|$|E
