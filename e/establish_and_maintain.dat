The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws. Furthermore, no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function was to <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between {{the deck and}} the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper {{so that it could}} keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

Order was soon restored, and upon the arrival of United States Army troops as occupation forces on 31 October, the 2nd Regiment was disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E

25|$|When {{isolated}} from the base-camp, on distant sorties or remote observations, it was prudent for only the skilled radio operators to <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> medium and/or long range communications (a life-line for evacuation, re-supply, etc.) often assisted by a fugacious relay station tactically placed in an expedient vicinity (higher ground). The use of Morse code decreased after the introduction of more reliable radios. For obvious reasons, at least one skilled radio operator had to be present (even if alone for a while) on observation posts and relay stations, as maintaining a constant connection to the base-camp and/or JOC was critical for successful outcomes.|$|E
25|$|As the German fighter squadrons usually fought {{well within}} German lines, it was {{practicable}} to <b>establish</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> very strict {{guidelines for the}} official recognition of victory claims by German pilots. Shared victories were either credited {{to one of the}} pilots concerned or to the unit as a whole – the destruction of the aircraft had to be physically confirmed by locating its wreckage, or an independent witness to the destruction had to be found. Victories were also counted for aircraft forced down within German lines, as this usually resulted in the death or capture of the enemy aircrew.|$|E
