Elyon refers to elevation and being exalted. These are, however, not proper names for God, but epithets also used for rulers and judges. Adonai has a similar context and refers to God as a powerful ruler. Similarly, El Shaddai, derived from [...] "shad" [...] i.e. Lord, also points to the power of God.|$|E

40|$|When the African National Congress won the South African {{election}} in 1994, the white minority rule ended {{and a new}} era of peaceful political, social and economical transformation began. Black Economic Empowerment was, and still is, one of the main pillars of this process, developed and designed especially to overcome the racial, social and economic rift between white and black South Africans left by the apartheid regime. It was created to empower black people and enable them to {{become an integral part of}} the economy. The Black Economic Empowerment initiative is however one of great controversy. It has as many critics as it has followers, especially the affirmative action part of it. In this master thesis I discuss the subject of Black Economic Empowerment in South Africa, <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost</b> <b>seen</b> from a legal point of view. I focus on the affirmative action part of BEE and discuss whether or not the legal frameworks support it and if so; how the regulations are constructed. In this process I include both relevant national and international frameworks. I look into the legal structure and functions and if these result in generating violations of international conventions and humans right standards, e. g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My thesis includes an analysis of the legal elements that embody the affirmative action part of the Black Economic Empowerment initiative, but I also put Black Economic Empowerment in a social, economical and political context where I discuss progress made, as well as trials and tribunals, relevant factors and events. I discuss the concept that is BEE; what it is, what led up to it, why it is important and what the positive and negative aspects of BEE are...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} a twofold purpose. The <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost</b> is to <b>see</b> whether there exists any {{correlation}} between the collocational knowledge and general linguistic knowledge of EFL learners. The second is to reveal which type(s) of collocation is or are more difficult for EFL learners. To this end, 35 subjects, screened by a proficiency test, were given a 90 -item multiple-choice test including lexical collocations (noun+noun, noun+verb, verb+noun, and adjective+noun), and grammatical collocations (noun+preposition and preposition+noun). A native speaker checked {{the final version of}} the data and necessary corrections were made. The results showed that a) there was no significant correlation between general linguistic knowledge and collocational knowledge of EFL learners, and b) the grammatical collocations were more difficult than the lexical collocations for learners and from among all subcategories, noun+preposition was the most difficult and noun+verb was the easiest...|$|R
40|$|The {{educational}} needs of the 21 st century pose a number of serious problems for current educational practices. <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost,</b> we <b>see</b> the 21 st century as a time that is characterized by constant change. Educational practices {{that focus on the}} transfer of static knowledge simply cannot keep up with the rapid rate of change. Practices that focus on adaptation or reaction to change fare better, but are still finding themselves outpaced by an environment that requires content to be updated almost as fast as it can be taught. What is required to succeed in education is a theory that is responsive to the context of constant flux, {{while at the same time}} is grounded in a theory of learning. Accordingly, understanding the processes of learning which underwrite the practices emerging from participation in digital networks may enable us to design learning environments that harness the power of digital participation for education in the 21 st century. For much of the 20 th century, learning had focused on the acquisition of skills or transmission of information or what we define as “learning about. ” Then, near the end of the 20 th century learning theorists started to recognize the value of “learning to be, ” of putting learning into a situated context that deals with systems and identity as well as the transmission of knowledge. We want to suggest that now even that is not enough. Although learning about and learning to be worked well in a relatively stable world, in a world of constant flux, we need to embrace a theory of learning to become. Where most theories of learning see becoming as a transitional state toward becoming something, we want to suggest that the 21 st century requires us to think of learning as a practice of becoming over and over again. This paper, then, is an effort to embrace change and focus on becoming as central and persistent elements of learning. In order to understand both what that means and how it might be achieved, we need to examine some of the recent transitions in learning which have emerged in the 21 st century. In particular we need to consider several dimensions of learning (knowing, making, and playing) that have taken on new, more distributed forms in the networked age...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{how young}} people in upper {{secondary}} school express them-selves about environmental issues. The aim {{of the study is}} to analyse how expres-sions about the environment can relate to policies of the concept of Education for Sustainable Development, ESD. The study put forward a view of environmental issues also being societal issues. Using a qualitative method of participatory model-ling, partakers creatively visualize their discussions in two workshop-assignments about either consumption or the future in the year 2050 in groups. Young peoples´ expressions about environmental issues can be described in accordance with two-parted ways of thinking about the environment and humanity, either as loosely or firmly connected. Not only do the two-parted ways of thinking apply to relation-ships between the environment and humanity, they are also used in describing a two-parted future trajectory towards either environmental collapse or sustainable futures. Moreover, ways of handling environmental issues are described as two-parted be-tween societal large-scale arrangements and individual efforts. Young people in the study express that they search for “right” things {{to do in order to}} reach a sustainable future. While not finding those prescribed solutions fulfilling or feasible either in education, or in society, feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness arise. Participants suggest there is one way to handle environmental issues and evade environmental collapse, which is to urgently turn negative trends into positive ones. Training {{young people in}} systemic and complicated ways of thinking open up for feelings of hope and may serve as empowerment in their comprehension of how they can live in the world today. The design, performance and discussions rendered by the study is <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost</b> to be <b>seen</b> as a contribution to how young people in upper secondary school can be given time and space to participate in both cognitive and emotional meaning-making processes about environmental issues as societal issues...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is based on}} seven chapters and six individual research articles and contributes to different strands of the economics literature, among others to environmental and resource economics, ecological economics, public economics, as well as behavioural <b>and</b> experimental economics. <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost,</b> however, I <b>see</b> the thesis contributing to the emerging research area of sustainability economics. Specifically, I address some core aspects of the broader research agenda on sustainability economics. Chapter 2 studies how the economic valuation of non-marketed environmental goods depends {{on the distribution of}} income within a society, thus speaking to the intra-generational dimension of the human-nature relationship. Chapter 3, in turn, is concerned with allocative and distributive issues across generations. Specifically, it examines how society should allocate costs and benefits of public projects, such as those aimed at mitigating climate change, over time. Furthermore, chapters 4 and 5 address the role of `essential needs’ and `limitations’ as noted in the seminal Brundlandt definition of sustainability by studying to what degree scarce environmental goods and services indeed have human-made substitutes and complements if one takes subsistence consumption into consideration. Chapters 6 and 7 make use of economic experiments to study ethical behaviour of both fishermen and scientists, with a specific focus on honesty and truth-telling. While {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of fishermen is directly relevant to the management of an important common pool resource, the question of whether scientists tell the truth is of fundamental importance for science at large and perhaps even more so for sustainability economics, which sees itself as a relevant science that not only follows a cognitive interest, but also a direct action or management interest in facilitating a transition towards a sustainable development...|$|R
