40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effects of com-positional {{characteristics}} on memorization efficiency. Fourteen research studies investigating musical memoriza-tion provided efficiency data and sufficient information to collect the notation for memorized excerpts (N = 56). Com-positional characteristics chosen for inclusion in the re-gression model were number of bars, number of beats, number of notes, tonality, number of sharps/flats in key signature, number <b>of</b> <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones,</b> meter, tempo, and number of repeating bars. Number of notes (representing amount of memorized material) was found to be the single best predictor of memorization efficiency (Adjusted R 2 =. 565) with additional factors of number of beats (represent-ing length), number <b>of</b> <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> (representing har-monic complexity), and tonality accounting for 70. 2 % of the variance. A curve estimation was computed to project memorization efficiency of concert pieces. Compositional characteristics, isolated from memorization strategies, pre-dict the amount of time required to memorize a piece...|$|R
5000|$|This {{work was}} {{composed}} {{along with a}} series of vocal compositions based on texts by Hungarian poet Sándor Weöres. It was composed in 1955 in Budapest, but was first performed thirteen years later, on March 16, 1968, in Stockholm, with the Swedish Radio Choir under the baton of Eric Ericson. It was eventually published by Schott Music. This was the last vocal composition by Ligeti in which he used his early compositional style, for he announced that in Lux Aeterna (1966) he [...] "broke with (his) preceding style <b>of</b> <b>chromatic</b> <b>tone</b> clusters". After this composition, Ligeti only retook texts by Weöres again 30 years later, with Magyar Etüdök.|$|R
40|$|Music {{historians have}} {{observed}} informally that Western music became increasingly chromatic between roughly 1600 and 1900. This view is tested formally, {{and the results}} are shown to be consistent with the standard view. Music historians have similarly assumed that the music of major composers such as Mozart and Beethoven became increasingly chromatic over their respective lifetimes. Measurements of chromaticism in both theme-based and opus-based samples are shown to be inconsistent with these intuitions. At face value, {{the results of this study}} affirm that Western art music has become more chromatic over time, but that five major composers' use <b>of</b> <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> changed little (quantitatively) over the course of their careers. Repercussions for stylistic interpretations of these composers are discussed...|$|R
50|$|This is {{composition}} of remarkable originality. Written in one single movement, {{it is based}} on a theme consisting partly of a sequence <b>of</b> <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> hidden behind the intervals of the ninth, the diminish octave and seventh. The composer occasionally uses only a short motive from this theme, extending the theme itself in other places so as it encompass all the twelve notes of the scale and thus manages to build an impressive work. Gradually condensing the musical texture and accelerating the tempo, the author creates a <b>gradation</b> <b>of</b> extraordinary force, reaching the climax in the part marked con brio. This is followed by appeasement and meditation, vanishing completely {{at the end of the}} composition. This Concerto makes masterful use of some new possibility of the clarinet, such as flutter-tongue or effect of a dual tones which is the result of differentiation in dynamics. Written in an unconventional way, without the usual brilliant passages, this work achieved quite new, unusual sound qualities. However, all those inventity devised and realized means of s by the clarinet are not there for the sake of mere effect, having been used by composer exclusively for expressing the emotional contents of his work.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} range {{starting from}} a low F {{is based on the}} characteristics of the single horn in F. But {{there is a great deal}} of music written beyond this range, on the assumption that players are using a double horn in F/B. Its valve combinations allow for the production <b>of</b> every <b>chromatic</b> <b>tone</b> from two octaves on either side of the horn's written middle C (sounding F immediately below the bass clef to F at the top of the treble clef). Although the upper range of the horn repertoire rarely exceeds high C (two octaves above the horn's middle C, sounding F at the top of the treble clef), skilled players can achieve yet higher pitches.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Striking {{changes in}} {{sensitivity}} to tonality across the pitch range are reported. Participants were presented a key-defining context (do-mi-do-sol) followed by one <b>of</b> the 12 <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> the octave, and rated {{the goodness of}} fit of the probe tone to the context. The set of ratings, called the probe-tone profile, was compared to an established standardised profile for the Western tonal hierarchy. The presentation of context and probe tones at low and high pitch registers resulted in significantly reduced sensitivity to tonality. Sensitivity was especially poor for presentations in the lowest octaves where inharmonicity levels were substantially above the threshold for detection. We propose that sensitivity to tonality {{may be influenced by}} pitch salience (or a co-varying factor such as exposure to pitch distributional information) as well as suprathreshold inharmonicity. ...|$|R

5000|$|Melakarta is a South Indian {{classical}} {{method of}} organizing Raagas {{based on their}} unique heptatonic scales. The postulated number of melakarta derives from arithmetical calculation and not from Carnatic practice, which uses far fewer scale forms. Seven-pitch melakarta are considered subsets of a twelve-pitch scale roughly analogous to the Western chromatic scale. The first and fifth melakarta tones, corresponding to the first and eighth <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones,</b> are invariable in inflection, and the fourth melakarta tone, corresponding to the sixth or seventh <b>chromatic</b> <b>tone,</b> is allowed one of two inflections only, a natural (shuddah) position and a raised (tivra) position. The second and third melakarta tones can be picked from the 4 <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> (second through fifth), and similarly for the sixth and seventh. Thus the number of possible forms is equal to twice {{the square of the}} number of ways a two-membered subset can be extracted from a four-membered set: ...|$|R

40|$|The last {{restoration}} of Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel was directed and {{conducted by the}} internal staff of the Vatican Museums, in the period from June 1980 to April 1994. The historical importance of this restoration {{is found in the}} recovery <b>of</b> the unexpected <b>chromatic</b> <b>tones</b> used by Michelangelo and hidden for centuries by the dust, black smoke and grease produced by candles and braziers, and by the animal glue, gum resin and ox bile used by restorers in the past to revive the colors. The important result was obtained without any risk, thanks to developments in the field of methods and materials, the progress made in diagnostics, and the elaboration of a theory of restoration (Brandi C. 1950) which still acts as a support to the scientific and technical guidelines used in restoration today. The good preservation of the frescoes in the Chapel is entrusted to a filter and air conditioning system which was renewed and upgraded in 2015, and to modern LED lighting installed in the same year. The cleaning of the frescoes, which were almost perfectly preserved thanks to Michelangelo’s technique, allowed us to study the artist’s painting technique and to learn that some of the techniques he employed in marble sculpting were applied to his painting, and that he introduced novel methods, such as the technique used to give three-dimensionality to figures or his particular brushstrokes, which anticipated divisionism and pointillism...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{non-traditional}} theo- retical techniques of Erno Lendvai and introduce the application of these techniques in a detailed analysis of the Fifth String Quartet of Bela Bartok. The theories of Lendvai are based on the Fibonacci Series, a series of integers which he assigns to consecutive half-step <b>gradations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chromatic</b> scale. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 [...] . are manipulated to produce two important cornerstones of his theory, namely mi-pentatony and alpha harmonies. According to Lendvai, mi-pentatony, directly related to the Hungarian folksong idiom, is the basic scale used by Bartok. Alpha harmonies are derived by the intervallic relationships created through the use of Fibonacci numbers. Erno Lendvai's theories, although not widely known, are a partial answer to the analytical problems Bartok's music presents. His con- cepts allow for tertian chords as well as non-tertian harmonies. By basing his theories on the intervallic relationships which comprise the folksong idiom, Lendvai's theories can account for much of Bartok's music. Lendvai's theory, in contrast to traditional tonality, not only allows the tritone interval between roots of chords, but relies heavily upon it. The axis system and relative chord structures establish polar relation- ships which give the same function to chords whose roots are a tri- tone apart. Through the use of polar exchange, it is possible to shift the tonal center by six key signatures, yet never alter the function of the two polarly related chords. The analysis portion of this paper is designed to give a struc- tural, tonal and harmonic overview of each movement, giving particular attention to three areas: pentatony; relative, modally related and substitute chord harmonies; alpha harmonies. These areas assume varying degrees of importance depending on the particular movement. The theories of Lendvai are too new and untried to place them into any kind of perspective at this time. Lendvai's own writings are concerned more with a few specific pieces of Bartok's works which conform neatly to golden section principles, clear cut use of models (1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 5), or alpha harmonies. His writings avoid thses portions of Bartok's music which defy explanation using this methodology...|$|R

In these ratings, pitch height was more prominent for less musical listeners or with less musical (sinu-soidal) tones, whereas octave equivalence and the tonal hierarchy prevailed for musical listeners, especially with harmonically richer tones.
