5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
25|$|For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was {{the symbol}} of {{what was wrong with}} the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the {{financial}} difficulties of the nation were placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal, and under the new republican <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it meant {{to be a member of}} a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor. The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work.|$|E

500|$|Although Sgt. Pepper's was {{preceded by}} several albums that had begun to bridge the line between [...] "disposable" [...] pop and [...] "serious" [...] rock, it {{successfully}} gave an established [...] "commercial" [...] voice to an alternative youth culture and marked {{the point at which}} the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single. Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was possible and audiences' <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between [...] "pop" [...] and [...] "rock', thus eliminating the [...] "roll" [...] from [...] "rock and roll" [...] (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained [...] "rock" [...] would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from [...] "radio friendly" [...] standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective [...] "progressive" [...] for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.|$|E

Her reviews praised detailed and engaging descriptions of people and places, musings on history, and an insatiable curiosity in the traveller.|$|E

According to About.com's Anthony Carew, the record took the band [...] "from the cult {{corner of the}} Pacific Northwest to international acclaim". Writing for Nooga.com, Joshua Pickard stated that the album [...] "was a revelation for both its clever use of punk principles and for its breakdown of social assumptions." [...] With the album, Pickard felt that Sleater-Kinney [...] "succeeded in reshaping what was considered possible for punk rock", and that the album transformed the band into [...] "an institution of rebellion and proponents of a musical insurgency.

[...] He complimented its clarity and easy grace, but also pointed to these as possible Achilles' heels for Gladwell because of his oversimplification of complex sociological phenomena to [...] "compact, pithy explanations". Furthermore, he praised the book for asking some important questions, such as [...] "How much potential out there is being ignored?

500|$|There {{were many}} {{difficulties}} {{in developing the}} game's voice navigation system, as no verbal dialogue had featured in a Sonic Team game before.

The team tested different forms of navigation systems and picked the best. Although they acknowledged that having a voice navigation system would make the use of background music impossible, they realised that it would help create a dramatic atmosphere. Miyoshi thought that the sound effects of fire and walls creaking alone would be enough to produce immersion.|$|E

500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and you put your best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
500|$|Planescape: Torment {{was given}} several Editor's Choice awards, was named RPG of the Year for 1999 by both GameSpot and Computer Gaming World, {{and won the}} Vault Network's Game of the Year for 1999.

The {{magazine}} also nominated Torment for its 1999 [...] "Best Roleplaying Game" [...] award, which ultimately went to System Shock 2. It has since attracted a cult following, and continues to garner respect long after its release—in 2004, GameSpy added it to their Hall of Fame, and in 2005 GameSpot declared it one of its greatest games of all time. In 2007, IGN named it 71st on their list of the Top 100 Games of All Time, stating that many have [...] "had their <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> an RPG is completely revamped after playing this one".

500|$|After {{learning}} she {{had been}} cast, Reed hired a personal trainer and practiced a healthier diet to prepare herself for her revealing costumes in which she exposes her midriff as the character. In the musical, Jasmine resembles an even stronger, more spirited character than the film version, specifically {{the way in which}} she fights against marriage laws and men who wish to control her. Reed believes her character changed the most during workshops as the show traveled from Seattle to Toronto, and finally Broadway, including the replacement of an original musical number with [...] "These Palace Walls", which composer Alan Menken wrote specifically for Reed. Described by Reed as [...] "a really beautiful song" [...] that [...] "sets up her character", [...] "These Palace Walls" [...] narrates Jasmine's desire to explore the world beyond the confines of the palace, despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with. Reed originally found performing [...] "A Whole New World" [...] particularly daunting because, as the film's most famous song, [...] "everyone has these very specific <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they think it should look like or sound like", in addition to feeling pressured to match Salonga's performance, of whom she is a fan.|$|E

Pitchfork stated that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about Glass Swords is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks" [...] and that [...] "there's not a lot here that will redefine your <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a [...] "greatest bits" [...] collage." [...] Fact gave the album a five out of five rating, stating that [...] "you get the impression that it's the point Rustie has been building up to for the last five years; an album made in relative isolation, with zero self-consciousness, shame or thought for trend behind it." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating, finding that the album is [...] "equally impressive is the fact that this formula (or lack thereof) never grows tired.

2500|$|Up {{until the}} early mid-20th century, {{mainline}} Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution.

By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist Bible Belt communities, led to a backlash.
