5|$|In hatching, mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with an <b>egg</b> <b>tooth</b> and {{are born with}} fully {{developed}} venom glands; capable of inflicting a potentially lethal bite minutes after hatching. The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues of the egg yolk, and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the <b>egg</b> <b>tooth.</b> Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|The newly hatched American white ibis {{is covered}} with violet down feathers, {{deepening}} to dark brown or black {{on the head and}} wings. The chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The irises are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an <b>egg</b> <b>tooth</b> which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage. Once fledged, the juvenile American white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white. The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage. This is mostly complete {{by the end of the}} second year, although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.|$|E
50|$|A caiman nest is a {{mound of}} {{vegetation}} and mud consolidated by the female by lying on it. She then digs {{a hole in it}} and buries a few dozen eggs in it. When these hatch, the juveniles use their <b>egg</b> <b>teeth</b> to break their way out. They are about 23 cm long at hatching, growing to 60 cm by a year later. They look like miniature versions of their parents but have relatively shorter snouts and larger eyes.|$|R

50|$|A typical clutch off eggs {{ranges from}} 2 to 4. The {{incubation}} period may last 24 or 25 days after laying. The young are semi-precocial with shell removal {{being done by}} the parents. The chicks have upper and lower mandible <b>egg</b> <b>teeth,</b> which they lose 3 to 5 days after hatching. The chicks usually leave the nest with the parents 4 days post hatching and move into areas of denser vegetation. Fledging occurs 28 days after hatching. After {{a few weeks of}} fledging, young terns leave the natal colony but join the group for roosting, while migrating towards the wintering ground.|$|R
5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their <b>egg</b> <b>tooth</b> at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.|$|E

25|$|Full-term chicks of most {{bird species}} {{have a small}} sharp, calcified {{projection}} on their beak, which they use to chip {{their way out of}} their egg.

Despite its name, the projection is not an actual tooth, as the similarly-named projections of some reptiles are; instead, {{it is part of the}} integumentary system, as are claws and scales. The hatching chick first uses its <b>egg</b> <b>tooth</b> to break the membrane around an air chamber at the wide end of the egg. Then it pecks at the eggshell while turning slowly within the egg, eventually (over a period of hours or days) creating a series of small circular fractures in the shell.

However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an <b>egg</b> <b>tooth</b> while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out. Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of hatching, though petrels keep theirs for nearly three weeks and marbled murrelets have theirs for up to a month.

25|$|The female lays {{a single}} soft-shelled, {{leathery}} egg 22 days after mating, and deposits it directly into her pouch. An egg weighs 380 milligrams (some sources say 1.5 – 2 grams) {{and is about}} 1.4 centimetres long. While hatching, the baby echidna opens the leather shell with a reptile-like <b>egg</b> <b>tooth.</b> Hatching takes place after 10 days of gestation; the young echidna, called a puggle, born larval and fetus-like, then sucks milk from the pores of the two milk patches (monotremes have no nipples) and remains in the pouch for 45 to 55 days, at which time it starts to develop spines. The mother digs a nursery burrow and deposits the young, returning every five days to suckle it until it is weaned at seven months.

2500|$|The bird {{skeleton}} {{is highly}} adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight but {{strong enough to}} withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the pygostyle. Because of this, birds usually have {{a smaller number of}} bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, instead having a beak, which is far more lightweight. [...] The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an <b>egg</b> <b>tooth,</b> which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg, and that falls off once it has done its job.|$|E
50|$|Polyphyodonts include most toothed fishes, many {{reptiles}} such as crocodiles, geckos, {{and most}} other vertebrates, mammals being the main exception.

From 1940, he produced more masked images with geometrical shapes depicting <b>teeth,</b> <b>eggs</b> and other such features in pure spectral colours. His Græshoppedans (Grasshopper Dance, 1941) depicts simplied figures in a work suggesting the culmination of high summer.|$|R

2500|$|In summer, {{the female}} builds {{a nest of}} {{vegetation}} where the decomposition of the vegetation provides the heat needed to incubate the eggs.

She will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area. Adult alligators regularly cannibalize younger individuals, though estimates of the rate of cannibalism vary widely. In the past, immediately following the outlawing of alligator hunting, populations rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adults preying upon juveniles, increasing survival among the young alligators.|$|E

40|$|Unlike bony fish, {{sharks are}} K-selected animals whose life history {{strategies}} generally {{include the use}} of protected nursery areas by young of the year and juveniles. Nursery areas can be primary (i. e., grounds where the sharks are born and spend the very first part of their lives) or secondary (i. e., grounds inhabited by slightly older but not yet adolescent or mature individuals). Criteria utilized to recognize and define these strategic habitats include: high concentration of young sharks, continuous or repeated use on various temporal scales, high food availability, and low predation risk. Since the fossil record of sharks is mainly composed of isolated teeth, identification of paleo-nurseries involves a series of problems due to difficult application of the above reported criteria. In fact, only four putative shark paleo-nurseries have been individuated to date: three of them regard lamniform sharks and were proposed {{on the basis of a}} few isolated small-sized teeth, whereas the fourth one comprises hybodontid and xenacanthid taxa and is testified by both selachian <b>eggs</b> and juvenile <b>teeth.</b> 	In the upper Miocene (Tortonian) deposits of the Pisco Formation exposed at Cerro Colorado (South Peru), a very rich shark tooth bearing level has recently been discovered.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the dry season, females build a nest of {{soil and}} vegetation, which is about 1.5 m across and 0.75 m wide. They lay up to 65 eggs (though usually somewhere between 30 and 60), which hatch in about six weeks, at the {{beginning}} of the wet season, when newly flooded marshes provide ideal habitat for the juveniles once hatched. The eggs are quite large, averaging 144 g in weight. Unguarded clutches (when the mother goes off to hunt) are readily devoured by a wide array of animals, regularly including mammals such as South American coatis (Nasua nasua) or large rodents, egg-preying snakes and birds such as herons and vultures. Occasionally predators are caught and killed by the mother caiman. Hatching is said to occur between 42 and 90 days after the eggs are laid. It is well documented that, as with other crocodilians, caimans frequently move their young from the nest in their mouths after hatching (whence the erroneous belief that they eat their young), and transport them to a safe pool. The mother will assist chirping, unhatched young to break out of the leathery eggs, by delicately breaking the <b>eggs</b> between her <b>teeth.</b> She will try to look after her young for several months but the baby caimans are largely independent and most do not survive to maturity. Baby black caimans are subject to predation even more regularly after they hatch, facing many of the same mesopredators, as well any other crocodilian (including those of their own species), large snake or large, carnivorous fish that they encounter. Predation is so common that black caimans count on their young to survive via safety in numbers. The female black caiman only breeds once every 2 to 3 years.|$|R
