40|$|Considered {{from the}} {{perspective}} of Romania's accession to the European Union, we can say that starting with 1 January 2007, foreign trade transactions were delimited in relation to the customs borders in <b>intra-Community</b> <b>transactions</b> and international transactions. In this context, the way of conducting these operations is influenced by both the economic and financial features specific to both categories of transactions, that relate to the economic character of the activity, the diversity and specificity of the foreign trade activity, transport of goods, the complexity and regulation of intra-Community and international commercial transactions, and by the specific features of each category of transaction. Starting from the consideration that the economic and financial characteristics of foreign trade activity, specific to <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions,</b> have a significant influence in the organization and management of accounting of the entities involved in such transactions, determining in a greater or lesser extent, the way of capitalization of the financial and accounting information in the processes of analysis, decision and control, in this paper we proposed to address the features of intra-Community trade. <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions,</b> characteristics, customs barriers, Customs Union, value added tax...|$|R

In order to determine the person liable to pay value added tax, related to <b>intra-community</b> commercial <b>transactions,</b> must to clarify tax matters for those operations. Given the complexity of <b>intra-community</b> commercial <b>transactions</b> and their taxation, in the following issues we will address the intra-community trade in goods, with reference to specific tax treatment of supplies and intra-community acquisitions of goods. To do this we will consider more specific situations that arise in trade relationship between EU Member States, examples {{that will allow us to}} draw some conclusions on tax matters arising in intracommunity commercial relationshi...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{expansion}} and multiplication of international economic relations, in general, and of <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions,</b> in particular, where the goods and capital markets are developing at a rapid pace, ignoring national boundaries, accounting systems are {{necessary in order to}} provide through annual financial statements, as synthesis statements, with comparable information between the different states of the world, regardless of the region oforigin. Taking into account this need and based on the definition and valences of the Romanian accounting management in the EU accession conditions, it seemed fit to me to analyze the impact that <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions</b> had on the tax and accounting information; such analysis will give me the opportunity of making tax and accounting proposals designed to harmonize the intra-Community tax system in terms of value added tax...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is an {{essential}} part in European multi-modal transport system, representing approximately thirty-seven per cent of <b>intra-Community</b> <b>transactions</b> in tonnes per kilometre (tkm). Since 2001, the European Shortsea Network (ESN) in partnership with the short-sea Promotion Centres (SPC) of each Member State of the European Union (EU) have managed to make significant progress in the promotion and development of this mode of transport. This paper aims to assess and analyse the SSS of containerised goods in Portugal and its articulation with other EU routes and also other transport modes. The current SSS infrastructure, how the sector is organized, as well as the future perspectives for the sector are also analysed for the case of Portugal. The analyses are based on a survey that was carried out on the logistics operators, navigation agents, freight forwarders, and the leading imports and exports manufacturers in Portugal...|$|R
40|$|VAT {{is one of}} {{the newest}} tools of the global economy and is widely adopted in most of the countries. For EU Member States is {{required}} not only the existence of VAT, but also that its main characteristics to be uniformly implemented. This should facilitate <b>intra-Community</b> <b>transactions,</b> but in practice does not as there are many local variations which can lead to costly errors and penalties. The objective {{of this paper is to}} collate data about the main characteristics of VAT in EU Member States and to highlight the key differences between them. This survey shows that there continue to be opportunities and risks for businesses trading cross border, as a result of differences in application of Community legislation on VAT. This led to the necessity of VAT reform. On this basis, the Commission adopted on the end of the last year a Communication on the future of VAT. This sets out the fundamental characteristics that must underlie the new VAT regime, and priority actions needed to create a simpler, more efficient and more robust VAT system in the EU...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} a large debate has flourished about plural forms of value added tax (VAT) as a {{suitable}} instrument for federal systems {{and a number}} of countries have experienced taxes of such a nature. This paper considers a dual form of consumption taxation that was contemplated in the early stage of the European VAT construction. In 1962 the Neumark Report proposed for the European Ecnomic Community a VAT with an harmonised rate, covering all stages up to the wholesale trade, combined with a retail sales tax autonomously administered by each member country. Shortly after, a Commission was set up in Italy to study a reform of the tax system. Professor Cesare Cosciani, who had been a leading member of the Neumark Committee, chaired the Commission. In fact, the final report designed a system of indirect taxation for Italy along the lines sketched out by the Neumark committee. Moreover the structure of the VAT proposed by the Cosciani Report was quite different from the one later adopted in the European Community and would have offered some advantages in the following process of implementing a system of taxation of <b>intra-Community</b> <b>transactions</b> without border controls...|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} our country's {{accession}} to the Community space, the Romanian legislation has undergone many changes, and {{we should point out}} among others those in the tax system, that primarily aims to ensure the functioning of the national economy in the globalization of the economic and social activities worldwide. Although at first sight the new procedures {{have a positive impact on}} the development of intra-Community commercial businesses, due to the elimination of customs formalities and hence of the fees paid to customs officials, however there are costs generated by the application of EU law, which should not be neglected. Considering the many situations that arise in carrying out <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions,</b> that are aimed at the differentiated tax procedures from the value added tax perspective, we considered appropriate, to address below the tax features related to intra-Community acquisitions and supplies of new means of transport and excisable products, because these are two important categories of goods that generate differential tax treatments, so that after the tax analysis we should be able to draw some relevant conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Romania's {{accession}} to the European Union has required {{significant changes in}} many fields of activity, thefield of taxation {{is one of the}} most affected as taxation is fully harmonized with the European laws after January 1, 2007. Therefore, the export and import concepts disappeared in the relationship between the Member States, beingreplaced by new concepts such as intra-Community acquisition (instead of import) and intra-Community supply(instead of export). Given the <b>intra-Community</b> commercial <b>transactions</b> and hence their taxation, in this article I intend toaddress the tax treatment of non-transfers. I started from the fact that that the proper determination of tax treatments specific to intra-Communitycommercial transactions is of particular importance in establishing the reporting and payment obligations concerningthe value added tax for entities from different EU Member States, significantly affecting the registration procedure inaccounting of such transactions. To clarify the tax issues in terms of value added tax, I found it necessary, after identifying the operationsconsidered as non-transfers, to answer several questions based on which the tax treatment of such operations will bedetermined, questions that relate to the taxable person, taxable operation, the place of acquisition, the exemption or notof the operation and the obligation to pay VAT. For this I took into account several specific situations that arise in trade relations between EU Member Stateswhich fall within non-transfers, examples that allowed some conclusions to be drawn on the tax issues arising in intra-Community trade relations...|$|R
40|$|On the {{international}} markets of goods, pricing is usually {{done by the}} confrontation between supply and demand, under pressure from global competition; such pricing is influenced by many other factors that reflect the structural crisis phenomena triggered in the world economy, or factors specific to different groups of goods. After negotiation, the contracting parties should obtain the best price, {{taking into account the}} circumstantial situation of the world market upon the transaction, the quality and the technical and functional parameters of the goods subject to negotiations, comparable to those of the competition, the delivery terms and the payment method. From this perspective, we believe that the provision of substantiated external prices makes it easier to obtain maximum benefits and achieve the trade with foreign countries under the best terms. Because the external price is an essential element of the agreement of international sale of goods that contributes substantially to the profitability of an entity, we will deal below with the main categories of prices used in foreign trade activities, both in <b>intra-Community</b> and international <b>transactions,</b> taking into account the models for calculating the external price, compared to the delivery terms Incoterms 2010...|$|R
