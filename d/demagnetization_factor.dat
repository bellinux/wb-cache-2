40|$|We {{present a}} finite-difference micromagnetic {{approach}} {{for determining the}} normal modes of spin-waves propagating in extended magnetic films and strips, {{which is based on}} the linearized Landau-Lifshitz equation and uses the dynamic matrix method. The model takes into account both short range exchange interactions and long range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter are accounted for through plane-wave dynamic <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factors,</b> which depend not only on the geometry and relative positions of the magnetic cells, as usual <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factors</b> do, but also on the wave vector of the propagating waves. Such a numerical model is most relevant when the spin-wave medium is spatially inhomogeneous perpendicular to the direction of propagation, either in its magnetic properties or in its equilibrium magnetic configuration. We illustrate this point by studying surface spin-waves in magnetic bilayer films and spin-waves channelized along magnetic domain walls in perpendicularly magnetized strips.

40|$|The crossed-magnetic-field {{effect on}} the <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> of stacked second {{generation}} (2 G) high temperature superconducting tapes is presented. The superconducting sample was initially magnetized along the c-axis by the field cooling magnetization method and after achieving the magnetic relaxation of the sample, an extensive set of experimental measurements for different amplitudes of an applied ac magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane was performed. On the one hand, a striking reduction of the <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> compared with the reported values for superconducting bulks is reported. On the other hand, the <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> increases linearly with the amplitude of the ac transverse magnetic field confirming the universal linear behavior for the magnetic susceptibility predicted by Brandt [Phys.

The pattern of calculation of <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> N (coefficient of demagnetization) for such channel magnets is of utmost academic interest, and this pattern is provided in this article.

It isproven that the values of N and √ L / d have an exponential relation. Earlier, the author identified that the values of N for the porous media having a cylindrical form depend on the ratio of the length of magnet L to its diameter D. It is proven that the values of N and those of √ L / D also have an exponential relation. Therefore, this reciprocal conformity of relations in respect of the <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> for samples of the granulated medium (consisting of chains of magnets-channels) and for cores of magnets-channels (having different porosity values) has confirmed the similarity of the <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factor</b> for magnets having substantial and high concentration of the ferromagnetic material.

A number of unusual vortex phenomena are observed in these microstructures which differ qualitatively from the expected behaviour of more macroscopic pieces of film. In field-cooled (FC) experiments to similar to 65 K a full Meissner state is generated for cooling fields less than similar to 6 Oe, reflecting the relatively small <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factors</b> in our samples. Cooling in higher fields, however, results in only a very weak diamagnetic response at low temperatures whose magnitude is almost independent of the cooling field. In contrast we observe considerable trapped flux upon field-removal whose magnitude grows monotonically with cooling field. Remarkably, all FC flux distributions exhibit almost perfect rotational symmetry, and can be nearly completely cancelled in a reversible fashion by tuning the field applied to the initially FC state. Our field-cooled and zero-field-cooled results have been analysed in terms of a Bean-like critical state model containing constant edge and bulk current densities, and most of the observed phenomena can be explained by considering the relative weight of these two components. Not all flux profiles call be described by our simple model, however, and under certain circumstances symmetry-breaking 'dipole'-like flux structures can form in several adjacent YBCO squares.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on a {{particular}} aspect of nanotechnology, namely the understanding of magnetic states in nanometer-scale objects. Describing microscopic magnetization states and reversal is particularly important {{for the development of}} magnetic storage media. In order to further optimize information-bit density, innovative geometries involving magnetic nanowires have been suggested by Parkin et al. in 2008. The realization of both writing and reading in such magnetic nanowires depends on the reliable induction and control of domain wall movement. In this thesis we intend to shed light on basic dynamic effects in similar structures. Ferromagnetic nanotubes are the focus of this work due to their unique magnetic properties and unusual geometry. The reduced dimensionality of these structures manifests itself in magnetic configurations not present in macroscopic magnets. The magnetic samples that we are interested in are {{in the shape of a}} hollow prism with hexagonal cross-section and a very high aspect ratio. These structures avoid magnetization point singularities as present in solid magnetic cylinders, but support core-free magnetization states as a prerequisite for fast and controllable magnetization reversal. For this thesis, two different sets of magnetic samples are probed. One set of samples is processed to be Ni nanotubes, the other to be CoFeB nanotubes. Dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM) allows us to investigate the weak magnetic response of individual magnetic nanotubes without averaging over an inhomogeneous ensemble. With this sensitive method we are able to study the magnetization states, magnetization reversal mechanisms, and <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factors</b> of single nanotubes dependent on the applied field and the alignment of the sample. The study of demagnetizing factors has been a classical topic in magnetism since the development of modern electrodynamics by Maxwell in 1865. The advantages of our technique are the high precision of the associated frequency measurement and the potential of investigating arbitrary geometries, even at the nanometer scale. At the same time, interfering electrostatic and magnetostatic fields are entirely avoided by a purely optical readout. DCM is sensitive to the volume magnetization of the sample, instead of probing the total magnetic field including the stray field for instance. An individual nanotube is affixed to the end of an ultrasoft cantilever, which is a mechanical oscillator exhibiting beam-like shape, clamped at one end, free at the other, and capable of deflection in one direction only in the fundamental oscillation mode. To fabricate the sample-on-cantilever system, individual nanotubes are chosen from their substrate under an optical microscope, and glued to the cantilever using a hydraulic micro-manipulator setup, allowing the handling of nanometer-scale samples. The torque acting between the magnetic nanotube and the applied field shifts the resonant frequency of the cantilever. Changes in the magnetization state can be tracked in timescales in the order of a few cantilever oscillation cycles. This thesis is divided into four parts. In chapter  2 we establish the basic concepts of magnetism and introduce the coordinate systems used throughout the thesis. To explain phenomena such as magnetic anisotropy, or magnetic domain formation we consider the total magnetostatic energy of a given sample. Minimization of the energy yields the optimal angle of the magnetization within a magnetic particle, as shown for an important model system, the prolate ellipsoid. We review deviant magnetization states for samples with different geometry. Chapter  3 introduces our experimental method, DCM, after reviewing other means of magnetometry. To later explain our data, we derive the cantilever resonant frequency shift as a response to an applied magnetic field and discuss found solutions. We also derive <b>demagnetization</b> <b>factors</b> to describe the shape anisotropy of our samples. In chapter  4 we mention the components necessary to perform DCM measurements, from the physical properties of the cantilever to the experimental methods. Following in Feynman's footsteps, we illustrate bottom-up nanotube sample growth and fabrication methods including micro-manipulation and focused ion beam microscopy. Finally in chapter  5 we show and discuss the findings of our measurements. We measure the shift of the cantilever resonant frequency as a function of both the applied field and the alignment of the sample in three basic configurations to characterize the sample anisotropy. ...|$|R
