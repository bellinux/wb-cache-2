2500|$|Alfredsson {{began the}} 2011–12 season healthy, but was {{diagnosed}} with a concussion {{for the first time in}} his career after receiving a blow to the head from New York Rangers forward Wojtek Wolski on 29 October 2011. He returned on 11 November after missing five games, in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. On 30 December 2011, Alfredsson scored his 400th career goal, the game winner in overtime, versus the Calgary Flames. Widely assumed to be a candidate to be moved to a Stanley Cup contender at the 2012 trade deadline, Ottawa's strong play resulted in Alfredsson not being placed on the trade market. [...] "I was just really happy we didn’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> decision", said Alfredsson of the possibility of leaving Ottawa.|$|E

Cully was a part-time music critic, who regularly let students know if their performance was not up to standard by producing [...] "the most outrageous howling", in her mistress's words. At {{the end of her}} life, Cully, crippled and very weak, was warned by her adoring and saddened owner that she [...] "might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> special trip to the vet."

He performed as Abe Sapien in Hellboy, although the voice was performed by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce. Explaining the challenge of working so often in rubber suits and prosthetics, he notes, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{a part of my}} being and my physicality and again, acting is a full body experience and that's a part of it when you're doing a costumed character." ...|$|E

In his memoirs, Bay wrote that he replied: [...] "Mr. Knight, I agree that you have every right to send our guys free equipment. I can't stop you. But every time you do, I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> athlete ineligible and he'll have to send that stuff right back to Nike." [...] Bay also refused to accept a proposed donation from Bowerman to build a new athletic building on grounds that Bowerman wanted to control the use of the building, and Bay refused to accept the condition. The building was not built until after Bay left Oregon.|$|E

There are some tentative plans to upgrade them to Block IIA interceptors around 2018 as well (EPAA phase 3). In March 2013, a US defense official was quoted saying [...] "The Romanian cycle will start out in 2015 with the SM-3 IB; that system is in fly testing now and doing quite well. We are very confident it is on track and on budget, with very good test results. We are fully confident the missile we are co-developing with Japan, the SM-3 IIA, will have proved in fly testing, once {{we get to that}} phase.

When Ziva was a child her father told her that one [...] "can never truly know a person or their secrets". At the time, she had refused to believe him but later said that he had never been more honest with her. It is remarked upon several times that Eli [...] "raised her to be a killer", a fact that he does not deny and explains to Director Vance: [...] "Every day is a fight to survive.

5000|$|... "The {{good news}} for Democrats is that demonizing President Donald Trump {{galvanized}} and mobilized Democratic voters", Gonzales wrote. However, Democrats would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> strategy work in tougher terrain than a Democratic-leaning state senate district in Delaware {{if they wanted to}} regain the 24 seats needed for a House majority in 2018. For example, if the party spent $137 per vote, roughly as much as it did on Hansen in a successful effort to win the nearby 7th district of Pennsylvania, a swing district currently represented by Republican Pat Meehan but which has voted for Democratic presidential candidates and representatives in the past, it would cost $16 million. Much depends on whether the Democrats can maintain a consistent level of engagement among its base over the next 20 months, as the Tea Party did for Republicans {{during the early years of}} the Obama administration. [...] "The biggest lesson out of this Delaware race," [...] Gonzales concluded, [...] "appears to be that when Democrats dramatically outspend Republicans in Democratic districts, Democrats win." ...|$|E
