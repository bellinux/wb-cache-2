5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.|$|E

25|$|I {{frequently}} have differed with {{the opinions of}} Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily {{explained by the fact}} that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.|$|E

500|$|Of her character's changes after season five, Kirshner stated: [...] "I think she'll {{continue}} {{to be just like}} a tumbleweed and a car crash and I'm happy for that, I don't want it to be wrapped up. She'll never be normal and that's just the way it is." [...] Responding to the criticism Jenny has received, Kirshner states: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> what's said about the character for the most part. But again... it's my job. So, I mean, it's a fun character." ...|$|E
500|$|Jerry {{tries to}} apologize, even going {{as far as}} to compare ponies with compact cars, but Manya gets even more angry and leaves the table. Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others {{that he did not know}} she had a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony." [...] But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died. Jerry is very upset about it, but he's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship.|$|E
500|$|Later in June, Feige {{stated the}} film was still {{intended}} to be released on the July 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014. Feige elaborated that [...] "much of the movie will still be based very much on [...] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. [...] " [...] {{wanted to be sure}} that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad," [...] Feige continued. [...] "He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that, however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2016 MacBook Pro {{received}} mixed reviews. Ars Technica {{noted that}} the keyboard was a [...] "drastic departure" [...] from previous MacBook Pro keyboards, being a second-generation version of the keyboard used in the Retina MacBook. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it. Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage. Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price. Wired praised the display, calling it [...] "the best laptop display I've ever seen", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors. Likewise, The Verge concluded that [...] "using [...] is alienating to anyone living in the present. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Apple's vision of the future. I'm just not buying it today." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E

500|$|On 12 December 2008, Che was {{screened}} at New York City's {{sold out}} 1,100 person Ziegfeld Theater. Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died the way you would have him die. He was executed the way you would say he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Another favourite. It's hard to explain the special appeal of this episode. Perhaps it's because Homer is so exceptionally dumb. Or perhaps because it contains the 'D'oh!' 'A deer!' 'A female deer!' gag." [...] This gag was also praised by BBC News's Mark Milne, who said: [...] " [...] just cracks me up every time. Brilliant!" [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the fifth season included [...] "plenty of programs with potentially cheesy concepts", such as [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] and [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant". However, he thought the episode managed to [...] "easily overcome its possible flaws" [...] {{to turn into a}} [...] "very fine program". Homer's line [...] "Marge, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you in theory. In theory, communism works [...] In theory" [...] was Jacobson's favorite of the episode. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

"For {{the reasons}} set forth below, I am {{of the opinion}} that federal courts do have the power to award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie has criticised {{dairy farming}} {{and the use}} of leather balls. While {{coaching}} Yorkshire, the club was sponsored by a dairy, about which Gillespie said: [...] "Yes, they are a sponsor but it doesn't mean <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> what they do. It's out of my control, just like the fact that cricket balls are made of leather".|$|E
2500|$|CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in {{part and}} in the result): <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the result in this case but I [...] "would reserve for another day the {{questions}} of whether and how Lawrence [...] applies to the military.

2500|$|The filmmaker defended {{himself in}} an {{interview}} with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: [...] "Actually I do [...] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's right there, right up on the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point. Just because I think he's good {{on a lot of things}} doesn't mean <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him on everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lustiger upheld papal {{authority}} in theology and morals: [...] "There are opinions {{and there is}} faith," [...] he said in 1997. [...] "When it is faith, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Pope because I am responsible for the faith." [...] Cardinal Lustiger was a strong believer in priestly celibacy and opposed abortion and the ordination of women. Although he fully endorsed John Paul II's views on bioethics, he considered condom use {{if one of the}} partners had HIV. He founded the Non-Governmental Organization Tibériade to attend to AIDS patients.|$|E
