5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|E

5|$|Knox {{had avoided}} being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice {{to return to}} tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later {{he was still in}} charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He {{toyed with the idea of}} fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine. Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of older adults in Australia increases, {{attention}} is being directed toward ensuring their good health.  Research suggests that health outcomes of older adults are impacted by social belonging and loneliness, <b>and</b> that <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationship quality is pivotal to wellbeing.  However, the roles of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships in promoting social belonging {{have yet to be}} determined.     Aims: This study investigated if perceptions of social belonging in late adulthood are differentiated by the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships. Method:  The study consisted of two phases.  In Phase 1, 260 university staff and students, aged 18 to 75, completed an online survey investigating the quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> their association with social belonging.  In Phase 2, 88 older adults completed a refined print version of the survey.   Results:  Multiple regression was used to analyse the predictive ability of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships on social belonging. In Phase 1, significant associations were found between both <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging, with friendship yielding the strongest relationship.  Interestingly, in Phase 2 the association between quality of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> relationships <b>and</b> social belonging was mediated by age. Those aged 65 to 74 reported a significant relationship between <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> social belonging, which contrasted with those aged over 75.  A significant association between social belonging <b>and</b> <b>family</b> relationships was also found for the entire cohort aged over 65, while high quality friend relationships enhanced social belonging when family relationships were not strong. Conclusions: These results are tentative, but suggest that future research should consider the role that both friendships <b>and</b> <b>family</b> play in promoting social belonging in older adults...|$|R
30|$|Despite a {{range of}} {{symptoms}} associated with problem gambling, there is limited research exploring the role of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> {{in the treatment of}} problem gamblers or the efficacy of treatment for this group.
