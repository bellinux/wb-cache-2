40|$|Abstract: Demonstrating {{the safety}} of a system (ie. {{avoiding}} the undesired propagation of access rights or indirect access through some other granted resource) is {{one of the goals of}} access control research, e. g. [1 - 4]. However, the flexibility required from enterprise resource management (ERP) systems may require the implementation of seemingly contradictory requirements (e. g. complex separation of duty requirements but at the same time support for discretionary <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> business process <b>tasks</b> and rights). To aid in the analysis of safety problems in business processbased ERP systems, this paper presents a model-checking based approach [5]. This is done in the context of a real-world banking business process requiring static and dynamic separation of duty properties as well as <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>task</b> instances. This paper extends earlier work we have done in this area [6]. In particular, we now present a more structured analysis approach covering the inter- and intra-relationships between business process definitions and their instances. A fundamental notion is that of a business object which may be manipulated by one or several principals over multiple business process definitions and instances. This, in combination with the ability to delegate and revoke tasks, the possibly required rights, as well as maintaining dynamic separation of duty properties cannot be done manually any more and motivates our model-checking approach...|$|R

50|$|Like larger satellites, CubeSats often feature {{multiple}} computers handling different {{tasks in}} parallel including the attitude control, power management, payload operation, and primary control tasks. COTS attitude control systems typically include their own computer, {{as do the}} power management systems. Payloads {{must be able to}} interface with the primary computer to be useful, which sometimes requires the use of another small computer. This may be due to limitations in the primary computer's ability to control the payload with limited communication protocols, to prevent overloading the primary computer with raw data handling, or to ensure payload's operation continues uninterrupted by the spacecraft's other computing needs such as communication. Still, the primary computer may be used for payload related tasks, which might include image processing, data analysis, and data compression. Tasks which the primary computer typically handles include the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> to the other computers, attitude control, calculations for orbital maneuvers, scheduling, and activation of active thermal control components.

40|$|A {{workflow}} is {{a coordinated}} arrangement <b>of</b> related <b>tasks</b> in an automated process, the systematic execution of which, ultimately achieves some goal. Tasks {{that comprise the}} workflow process are typically dependent on one another. Security, in a workflow context, involves the implementation of access control security mechanisms to ensure that task dependencies are coordinated and that tasks are performed by authorized subjects only. A Workflow Authorization Model (WAM) [AH 96 b] has already been developed to enforce security principles on workflows, by addressing the granting and revoking of authorizations in a Workflow Management System (WFMS). This WAM satisfies most criteria required for an optimal access control model for workflows, some of which cannot be met through pure role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms. This paper addresses the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>task</b> authorizations within a workflow process by subjects in the organizational structure. The proposed The Delegation Authorization Model (DAM) will work within the security constraints imposed by the WAM when deciding whether delegations will be approved or denied.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{spirometry}} utilization among general {{practitioners and}} identify practitioner and practice-related {{factors associated with}} spirometry utilization. DESIGN: Multivariate multilevel cross-sectional analysis of a questionnaire survey. SETTING: Some 61 general practices involved in a spirometry evaluation programme in the Netherlands. All practices owned a spirometer and were trained to perform spirometry. SUBJECTS: A total of 144 general practitioners and 179 practice assistants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of spirometry utilization for five indications from national COPD/asthma guidelines, practitioner and practice-related factors associated with spirometry utilization. RESULTS: The response rate was 97 %. General practitioners used spirometry mostly to evaluate treatment with inhaled steroids (58 %). Significant practitioner-related factors associated with spirometry utilization were: general practitioners' job satisfaction, general practitioners' general interest in research, and prior participation in spirometry training. Practice-related factors associated with spirometry utilization were: presence of a practice nurse, <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>tasks</b> to practice assistants, use of spirometry in different rooms, and use of protocols in practice.
