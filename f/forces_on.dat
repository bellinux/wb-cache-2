Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines. It served as part of the British <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E

Simón Bolívar's arrival to the island prompted the partial destruction and abandonment of the fort in May 1816. By 1899, the facility serviced as headquarters, and later as quarters for the National Army. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem in}} {{first-class}} free end lever (distal extension base) Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is the lever <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the retention point that may harm the abutment tooth {{which has been}} discussed many times, but the amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point (rest) on the abutment tooth has never discussed yet. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point in the first class lever of lower free end denture on the two dimension static models. The analysis result reveals that the <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point is bigger than the mastication <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the free end saddle, or the <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point is equal to the sum of the force of the saddle and the <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the retention point. The <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point may cause trauma to the periodontal tissue of the abutment tooth. To decrease the amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the fulcrum point is by mastication force limitation, decreasing the distance between the mastication point and the fulcrum point; and increasing the distance between retention point and fulcrum point. For clinical application, there are many biological variables to be considered...|$|R
5|$|A 3,000-strong Army unit, as well {{as several}} Australian {{warships}} and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March1942.

Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean, attacking Ceylon in early April. The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon {{at the time of the}} raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate.|$|E
