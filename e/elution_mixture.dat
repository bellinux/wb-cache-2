Liquid chromatography with an open silica gel bed was used. Different volumes of hexane, hexane:dichloromethane (1 : 1 and 4 : 1, v/v), dichloromethane and methanol were used for the elution of individual fractions. Increasing volume of hexane was not sufficient for complete separation of a slightly polar fraction from the aromatic fraction. Increasing content of hexane in the <b>elution</b> <b>mixture</b> improved the separation of the group of target compounds. Soil and roadside dust extracts were obtained by using a pressurised solvent extractor with dichloromethane as the extraction solvent. Detection limits of the method ranged from 50 to 220 pg of individual nitro-PAHs injected into gas chromatograph.

First ICP-OES at a wavelength of 385. 958 nm was used for determination of uranium. Parameters were optimized and the effect of mineral acids (HCl, HNO 3), tensides (Septonex, Ajatin) and organic reagents like (4 -(2 -pyridylazo) resorcinol, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, 8 -hydroxyquinoline- 5 -sulphonic acid and 1, 2 -dihydroxyanthraquinone- 3 -sulphonic acid) was observed. For ICP-MS an isotope 238 U was chosen. As an internal standard 209 Bi (200 ?g•l- 1) was used. Modified silica gel was used (Silicagel tethered with C 18, C 8 alkyls and phenyl) and two types of Amberlite XAD 4 and XAD 16 for the preconcentration of uranium (VI). Commercially produced Amberlite was modified as follows: Drying at 100 °C (24 hours), milled, minced sorbent was selected and fractionated to particles size ranging from 0. 32 to 0. 63 ?m and finally activated in methanol. The deionised water and Septonex (5 • 10 - 3 mol•l- 1) at pH 8 were used for Amberlite conditioning. The optimal sorption of uranium (VI) proceeded at pH 8 in the presence of 4 -(2 -pyridylazo) resorcinol or ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate with Amberlite XAD- 16 moreover with 1, 2 -dihydroxyanthraquinone- 3 -sulphonic acid. All organic reagents have mass concentration five time larger than uranium. For the elution of uranium the mixture of 1 mol•l- 1 HNO 3 with acetone (ratio of 1 : 1) was used. Acetone was evaporated and the final analysis performed using ICP-OES. The preconcentration of uranium (VI) using Silicagel-C 18 conditioning was performed with ethanol, deionised water and Zephyraminu (5 • 10 - 4 mol•l- 1) at pH 8.

Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) was used to detect the analyte and IS. After extraction (ether:dichloromethane = 8 : 1), the analyte and IS were separated on a Waters BEH-C 18 column (100 mm × 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 μm) under a 5 min gradient <b>elution</b> using a <b>mixture</b> of acetonitrile and 0. 1 % formic acid aqueous solution as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0. 3 mL/min. ESI positive mode was chosen for detection. The method was fully validated for its selectivity, accuracy, precision, stability, matrix effect, and extraction recovery. This new method for yuanhuacine concentration determination in rat plasma was reliable and could be applied for its preclinical and clinical monitoring purpose...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{quality control}} (QC) {{strategy}} for {{quantitative and qualitative}} analysis of “common peaks” in chemical fingerprint was proposed to analyze Yuanhu Zhitong tablet (YZT), using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD–MS/MS). The chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent Eclipse plus C 18 column with a gradient <b>elution</b> using a <b>mixture</b> of 0. 4 ‰ ammonium acetate aqueous (pH 6. 0 adjusted with glacial acetic acid) and acetonitrile. In chemical fingerprint, 40 peaks were assigned as the “common peaks”. For quantification of “common peaks”, the detection wavelength was set at 254 nm, 270 nm, 280 nm and 345 nm, respectively. The method was validated and good results were obtained to simultaneously determine 10 analytes (protopine, jatrorrhizine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, xanthotoxin, bergapten, tetrahydropalmatine, imperatorin and isoimperatorin). For qualification of “common peaks”, 33 compounds including 10 quantitative analytes were identified or tentatively characterized using LC–MS/MS. These results demonstrated that the present approach may be a powerful and useful tool to tackle the complex quality issue of YZT...|$|R

The method {{was used to}} monitor MPH and RA after administration of MPH to rats. Deproteinized plasma spiked with 1 -(3 -trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (IS) was dried and labeled with 4 -(N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl) - 7 -fluoro- 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazole (DBD-F). The labeled sample was cleaned with two kinds of solid-phase extraction cartridge, and the DBD-labels were separated on an ODS column with gradient <b>elution</b> using a <b>mixture</b> of CH(3) CN and imidazole-HNO(3) buffer. Separation of MPH and RA can be achieved within 33  min. The LODs of MPH and RA {{at a signal-to-noise ratio}} of 3 were 2. 2 and 0. 4  ng mL(- 1), respectively. Moreover, monitoring of MPH and RA after MPH administration (10  mg kg(- 1)) to rat could be performed. The concentration of RA 480  min after administration was eight times higher than that of MPH. The proposed HPLC-PO-CL method was useful for determination of MPH and RA in rat plasma and was successfully used to monitor these substances after MPH administration...|$|R
40|$|This effort {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} two prototype devices for enhanced electrochemical detection of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) following preconcentration using an organosilicate sorbent. The bench-scale prototype provides adsorption of the targets from aqueous solution followed by <b>elution</b> in a <b>mixture</b> of methanol and potassium chloride (KCl). Following elution, the eluant is diluted using an aqueous KCl solution to provide sufficient electrolyte for electrochemical analysis. Concentrations of methanol greater than 50 % were detrimental to sensor performance and lifetime. Calibration of the electrochemical sensor was completed and results of electrochemical analysis were compared to those of HPLC analysis over a range of concentrations and in varied matrices. TNT detection {{was found to be}} consistent and detection limits were improved from 200 ppb to 3 ppb depending on the sample volume utilized. DNT detection showed higher variability and significantly greater false response rates. On the basis of these results, a second, more advanced, prototype was developed and utilized in limited field trials with the intention of moving the technology toward in situ applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of 2. 7 mu m superficially porous particles at 600 bar and sub- 2 mu m fully porous particles at 1000 bar were compared by the Poppe plot method. Theoretical Poppe plots were first constructed for each stationary phase to compare their kinetic performance at different analysis times. The theory was then verified by experiments under the optimized conditions identified from the Poppe plot calculation. We {{found that the}} 2. 7 mu m superficially porous particles at 600 bar can provide similar performance compared to the sub- 2 mu m fully porous particles at ultra-high pressure (1000 bar) when analysis times are very short (e. g. sub-minute). As analysis time increases, the superficially porous particles start to outperform the sub- 2 mu m particles and can give much higher efficiencies (e. g. > 2 times higher plate Count) at very long analysis times (> 3 h). The comparison was extended to gradient <b>elution</b> of a <b>mixture</b> of pharmaceutical interest by constructing gradient peak capacity Poppe plots and similar behavior was observed.

40|$|A non-suppressed {{conductivity}} detection ion chromatographic method using a weakly acidic cation-exchange column (Tosoh TSKgel OApak-A) {{was developed}} for the simultaneous separation and determination of common inorganic anions (Cl–, NO 3 – and SO 42 -) and cations (Na+, NH 4 +, K+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +). A satisfactory separation of these anions and cations on the weakly acidic cation-exchange column was achieved in 25 min by <b>elution</b> with a <b>mixture</b> of 1. 6 mmol L– 1 pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid and 8. 0 mmol L– 1 18 -crown- 6 at flow rate of 1. 0 mL min– 1. On this weakly acidic cation-exchange resin, anions were retained by an ion-exclusion mechanism and cations by a cation-exchange mechanism. The linear range of the peak area calibration curves for all analytes were up to two orders of magnitude. The detection limits calculated at S/N = 3 ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 9 µmol L– 1 for anions and cations. The ion-exclusion chromatography–cation-exchange chromatography method developed in this work was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of major inorganic anions and cations in rainwater, tap water and snow water samples...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{influence}} of mobile phase composition and temperature on chiral separation of racemic ibuprofen by capillary electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Materials and methods: Racemic ibuprofen was analysed on a chiral OVM column with an HPLC system 1100 Agilent Technologies, under isocratic elution, by using potassium dihydrogen phosphate 20 mM and ethanol in mobile phase. The flow rate was set at 1 mL/min, UV detector at 220 nm and different column temperatures were tested. For electrophoresis separation an Agilent CE G 1600 AX Capillary Electrophoresis System system, with UV detection, was used. The electrophoresis analysis was performed at different pH values and temperatures, with phosphate buffer 25 mM and methyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector. Results: The chromatograhic analysis reveals a high influence of mobile phase pH on ibuprofen enantiomers separation. An <b>elution</b> with a <b>mixture</b> of potassium dihydrogen phosphate 20 mM pH= 3 and ethanol, at 25 °C, allowed enantiomers separation with good resolution in less than 8 min. Conclusions: The proposed HPLC method proved suitable for the separation of ibuprofen enantiomers with a good resolution, but the capillary electrophoresis tested parameters did not allow chiral discrimination...|$|R
