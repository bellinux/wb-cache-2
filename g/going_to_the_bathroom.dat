5|$|Commissioner Gordon informs Batman {{that the}} {{patients}} of Arkham Asylum {{have taken over}} the facility, threatening to murder the staff unless Batman agrees to meet with them. Among the hostages are Dr. Charles Cavendish, Arkham's administrator, and Dr. Ruth Adams, a therapist. The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b>|$|E

Physical processes {{that depend on}} {{the weight of a}} body (like convection, cooking water or burning candles) act differently in free-fall. Cohesion and advection play a bigger role in space. Everyday work like washing or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> are not possible without adaptation. To use toilets in space, like the one on the International Space Station, astronauts have to fasten themselves to the seat. A fan creates suction so that the waste is pushed away. Drinking is aided with a straw or from tubes.|$|E

With the help of her neighbours, a Spanish Civil War veteran, and a young musician, Lucía sets out to find his kidnappers. She eventually discovers the truth about his disappearance after learning from the police that her husband is accused of being part of an elaborate embezzlement scam from within the Treasury Department of the government and may have possibly faked his kidnapping.|$|R
25|$|Kershaw {{can be seen}} {{presenting}} {{at public}} university film forums. Kershaw has contributed his experiences with acting and drama to public universities. While performing in the theater he's known to become emotional and challenge the audience. Kershaw addressed the country of El Salvador on national news across 7 million homes bringing together congressional leaders and administration officials in hopes to furnish clean water to communities. On December 30, 2014 Kershaw hung water paintings on corners of rural villages and W.U. Caribbean Magazine claimed an immediate impact on rural communities and they stated Kershaw's energy spread and his light shined bright on the world water crisis. The Caribbean's Drive Time Radio Show publicized Kershaw's clean water campaign and recorded him speaking out against the lack of sanitation in rural communities and he said, “If everybody stops <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> right now then we can save lives, but that’s never going to happen.” Kershaw was called 'He No Faking Jamaican' for his activism in the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|A hernia is the {{abnormal}} exit {{of tissue}} or an organ, {{such as the}} bowel, through {{the wall of the}} cavity in which it normally resides. Hernias come {{in a number of different}} types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral. Other hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias. Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area. Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.|$|E

5000|$|Around 75 {{women of}} {{different}} shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate, including Yunjin Kim, who later {{played the role}} of Sun-Hwa Kwon. In the initial plans, Jack was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge as the leader. She was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a fugitive, instead her husband was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> shortly before <b>the</b> plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose’s character. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa <b>to</b> work in <b>the</b> United States. She was supposed <b>to</b> start on <b>the</b> first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through.

[...] In the season two episode [...] "Maidenform", each secretary is categorized as either a Marilyn Monroe or a Jackie Kennedy as a campaign for Playtex; when asked what kind of woman Holloway is, Kinsey answers: [...] "Well, Marilyn's really a Joan, not the other way around".|$|R
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a fugitive, instead her husband was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> shortly before <b>the</b> plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive.

In a 1992 interview, Harrison commented on the volume of material: [...] "I didn't have many tunes on Beatles records, so doing an album like All Things Must Pass was like <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and letting it out."

On the same day of the song's digital release, a lyric video for it, produced by Joe Humpay, Aya Tanimura, Tim Zimmer, and Tuan Le, was released onto YouTube. It primarily shows Perry doing daily activities such as eating breakfast, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> and taking a bath, while texting the lyrics of [...] "Roar" [...] to friends. Some words are substituted with various Emoji characters. It was target of plagiarism accusations by music producer Dillon Francis, who felt it copied the concept of instant messaging from his video entitled [...] "Messages".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter {{has to go to}} the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Let's Get Loud" [...] plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with [...] "two of the three Ghostbusters." [...] Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian {{if they want to be}} [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E
50|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Starrcade was between Roddy Piper and Hollywood Hogan.

Piper returned to WCW at Halloween Havoc, and confronted Hogan. Piper claimed to be as big an icon as Hogan and wanted Hogan to admit it.

This was revealed to be true as the nWo came out, attacked Piper, and declared their alliance with Bischoff. The match between Piper and Hogan was made for Starrcade.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2011, Starr {{was arrested}} in Salt Lake City for {{investigation}} of drug possession and on an outstanding warrant from 2003 for failing {{to show up for}} sentencing on a separate drug-related conviction. Starr was the passenger in a van that was pulled over on a routine traffic violation near 1200 S. State about 12:30 a.m.. According to jail documents, Starr was illegally in possession of prescription medication, including the painkiller Opana, also known as oxymorphone, and alprazalam pills, used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. In addition, the officer found Starr had a warrant out for his arrest. According to Utah court records, Starr was convicted in 3rd District Court in 2003 of felony drug possession, but a bench warrant was issued on Aug. 25, 2003 when he failed to appear for sentencing. Another Salt Lake police report showed that in 2003, Starr and his father, John Starr, were arrested for allegedly doing drugs on a Southwest flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. John Starr said he was taking his son to drug rehab in Seattle at the time, the report states. John Starr was witnessed injecting Mike Starr with a syringe, and the two began arguing after the needle broke off, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> report. Mike Starr was seen <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plane <b>bathroom</b> for 15 to 20 minutes. When he returned, he handed John Starr something, and [...] "John then turned towards the window with a cut up coke can and a lighter," [...] the report states. The two were arrested as they stepped off the plane. Investigators found <b>the</b> Starrs <b>to</b> be in possession of a syringe and balloons filled with heroin, according to police records. In Mike Starrs pockets, police said they found Valium, Zanax, diazepam and Celexa. When they checked the Starrs luggage, they found drug paraphernalia and prescription drugs. Starr claimed his father forced him to shoot up in <b>the</b> plane, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> report.|$|R
