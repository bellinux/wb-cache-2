"I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section. Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday. The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can't sell a seven-foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent." [...] In his prime, Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted. Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain's previous record 78-point game, [...] "It {{was only a matter of}} time until he reached 100, you could wait for it." [...] Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing, then said, [...] "I always thought it was inevitable that he would do it. But when he did, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> thought about it. I couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This is interesting, very interesting, my boy," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>and</b> {{looking at}} the pavement; [...] "but I fear that it leaves us no clew with which to prosecute the search." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Gage {{passed his}} hand across his little meagre, smiling mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} hold up until I knock {{the bottom of this}} {{contract}} out," [...] he said, good-humouredly. [...] "I can't do it if <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> talk to you. Get a move on. Light out of this!" ...|$|R
60|$|This was serious. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> smiling, <b>and</b> {{begged him}} to explain.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Archer,’ quoth his lordship, ‘this is a rank ingratishood. What? I’m to go firing away in {{the dark}} in the cold po’chaise, {{and not so much}} as a game of écarté possible, unless <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> play with the postillion, the postillion; and the whole country {{swarming}} with thieves and rascals and highwaymen.’ ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> a great shout of {{laughter}} went up from all who stood round.|$|E
60|$|I was half-way up {{the stairs}} by this time. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> looked over the banisters.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> {{turned on}} him in the narrow sandy rut of pathway and he stopped likewise.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think to}} myself, {{do you know}} how many guys play their whole careers and never get the chance to be a champion? Yet, I was lucky enough to {{experience}} it. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> think, man that was big deal, a Super Bowl! And I had the opportunity to be a part of it!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But... but..." [...] I stammered. And then, quite suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> short, <b>and</b> listened. [...] "Hark, Fra Gervasio! Do you {{not hear}} it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked up}} at Giuliana. She smiled at me through unshed tears that {{magnified}} her matchless eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} hollow out a groove in the wet gravel with my heel. Words were not coming readily.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> {{looked up}} at her. She started back from me with a scream of terror. I looked down again at the title-page, and read the next lines-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{on hands}} <b>and</b> knees, for {{we had come}} to the bushes.|$|R
500|$|Aretha Franklin stated, [...] "I {{heard it}} on the TV. My sister Caroline <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> {{everything}} <b>and</b> stayed glued to the TV and radio. It was a tragedy. Shocking." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> short <b>and</b> {{hurried to}} her side, alarmed at her appearance. Her cheeks, even her lips, were ashen pale {{and her eyes}} were closed. She had fainted in her chair.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little before}} dark I passed a farm-house, {{at the open}} door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> said-- ...|$|E
60|$|By now we {{were walking}} side by side, for the train of wagons had gone ahead to the old outspan. So <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> looked her in the face.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> {{stared at}} him, since the lie was so amazing {{that it seemed}} to deprive me of the power of motion. Noting my very obvious disbelief he {{continued}} blandly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go if you like, Quatermain," [...] {{answered}} the Captain, [...] "but <b>I</b> shall <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> die here, for since my girl is gone I think I'm better dead." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> short, <b>and</b> looked {{towards the}} speaker. I smelt the fragrance, {{and saw the}} red spark of a cigar; the dusk outline of a man, too, bent towards me over the wicket.|$|R
3000|$|... “Yes, I {{seen a lot}} of changes. Since {{the first}} class I learned how to deal with certain {{stressful}} situations. Now when I see myself getting stress <b>I</b> <b>stop,</b> pause <b>and</b> clear my head”.|$|R
60|$|I was {{for going}} on, {{and after a}} little {{hesitation}} he resumed his spade; and then suddenly I {{was struck by a}} thought. <b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> so did he at once.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> looked back, and I {{heard the}} pad, pad of Cavor's feet receding. Then he stopped also. [...] "Bedford," [...] he whispered; [...] "there's {{a sort of}} light in front of us." ...|$|E
60|$|There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He was a {{long way}} down the sunny street, and was making {{expressive}} gestures for me to stop. <b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> he came up breathless.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. There are {{not many}} things I would not dare for you. That does not sound right perhaps; but <b>I</b> really--[he <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> passes {{his hand over his}} forehead, rather lost].|$|R
