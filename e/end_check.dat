40|$|Effect of Drying Method and Lumber Dimension on Drying Rate  and Defects of Suren Wood Efforts {{to improve}} {{productivity}} of wood industry must {{be supported by}} increasing supply of wood as raw materials. The limited wood supply due to natural forest degradation can be increased by wood harvested from plantation forests, including wood of suren (Toona sureni Merr) as one species composing the forests. In timber processing wood drying is an important aspect determining product quality. This study aimed to identify the effect of drying method and sortimen dimension on drying character of suren wood. Trunks of 3 suren trees of seven to nine years old were cut from Manggihan village, Getasan district, Semarang regency. The bolts were sawn (using blambangan method) to obtain sortimen papan wood of 3 cm (thickness), 8 cm (width), and 210 cm (length) and sortiment usuk wood of 4 cm, 6 cm and 210 cm. Beside two levels of sortimen size, two levels of drying method, e. g. natural and solar drying were also used in this research. Resulted data were analyzed with factorial complete randomized design. Measured parameters consisted of drying rate, dimension shrinkage and some drying defects e. g. bowing, cupping, <b>end</b> <b>check,</b> surface check and fungi infection. Research results showed that drying methods significantly affect drying rate, but not other parameters. Also, product dimension affects significantly to drying rate, but not other parameters. Interactions between the two factors did not give any significant effect on all parameter. To produce the same drying level on the same product size, solar drying method is faster than natural one. To reach dry wood with 14 % moisture content in solar drying method, sortimen papan and usuk needs 23 and 26. 8 drying days respectively, while in natural drying method, the same product size needs 44. 6 and 48. 50 days of drying respectively...|$|E
40|$|Solar lumber drying {{offers several}} {{advantages}} to those desiring an inexpensive means of drying small quantities of lumber. A solar kiln may be easily constructed with readi ly avai lable bui ld ing materials. When {{compared to the}} cost of custom kiln drying, the investment and operating costs of a solar kiln are minimal. When compared to air drying, drying lumber in a solar kiln offers several advantages. A well-designed solar kiln will be 20 to 30 ° F hotter than the outside temperature on sunny days. Thus, solar drying is a much faster process and is capable of drying lumber to moisture contents of 6 to 10 %, particularly in the summer months. It is unusual for air dried lumber to ever reach moisture contents much below 20 % unless it is dried in a heated building. Since solar drying offers protection of the lumber from the elements, the quality of the dry lumber is usually much better than air dried material in terms of seasoning checks and other defects. Solar drying is not without disadvantages. Topmost among these is the method’s dependence upon the weather. Drying rates vary greatly depending upon the outside temperatures and the number of hours of sunshine per day. Lumber dried in 30 days or less during the summer may require an entire winter to dry in a solar kiln. Likewise, {{it is not possible to}} reach the low moisture content (6 - 8 %) desired for furniture making or other quality indoor products by solar drying during inclement seasons of the year. It is also difficult to maintain uniform moisture contents within a charge of solar drying lumber. Thus, it may be advantageous to allow lumber to condition for several weeks in a heated building in order to achieve a desired equilibrium moisture content. There is a greater chance of checking and other seasoning defects with solar drying than with conventional kiln drying. However, defects may be kept to a minimum by following a few simple recommendat ions. <b>End</b> <b>check</b> ing can be significantly reduced by painting the ends of freshly sawed lumber with a commercial end coating or an aluminum based paint.

As a measure of fracture energy, the area under the load-crack opening displacement curve in the TR system was {{more than twice that}} in the TL and intermediate systems. These results indicate that cracks perpendicular to the tangential direction initiate radially with ease, and then crack arrest occurs to prevent growing. This finding provides a consistent interpretation of the end-check propagation observed during drying as follows: tiny <b>end</b> <b>checks,</b> as an analog of TR cracks, occur easily and selectively in latewood or transition wood and propagate toward the pith during drying. When there is no corresponding secondary check in the forward latewood, the checks are arrested and do not propagate further.|$|R

Intensity of warping (twist, bow, cup, crook) occurrence, superficial, internal and <b>end</b> <b>checks,</b> residual stresses, drying rate, and moisture gradient in the dried woods were measured, {{and the results were}} analyzed. The results showed that there was a more homogeneous moisture profile, fewer occurrences of superficial checks, and absence of internal checks in the protective drying schedules due to low warping values compared to the unprotective drying schedules. Therefore, it seems that protective drying schedules might be recommended as optimum program for wild cherry lumber drying at commercial scale from Duzce region...|$|R
