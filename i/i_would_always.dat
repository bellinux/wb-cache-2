500|$|Windle {{retired after}} the Games, noting that [...] "I have swum {{to that point}} when I could hardly lift myself out of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> give 110%. There is no {{substitute}} for hard and honest work". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{was raised}} in the Episcopal Church and has {{remained}} an Episcopalian throughout her life. After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your own faith. But first I always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E
500|$|In 1848 Richard Cobden had written: [...] "Almost every {{crime and}} outrage in Ireland is {{connected}} with the occupation or ownership of land... if I had the power, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> make the proprietors of the soil resident, by breaking up the large properties. In other words, I would give Ireland to the Irish". Nevertheless, his views were held {{in the context of}} Unionism; he had condemned the 1848 [...] "Young Ireland" [...] rebellion as an act of insanity. Jane adopted her father's standpoint on Irish land reform, yet embraced the cause of Irish home rule—on which she lectured regularly—and was a strong supporter of the Land League. After visiting Ireland with the Women's Mission to Ireland in 1887, she subsequently used the pages of the English press to expose the mistreatment of evicted tenants. In a letter to The Times, Jane and her associates cited one particular case—that of the Ryan family of Cloughbready in County Tipperary—to illustrate the British government's harshness towards even the most vulnerable of individuals. Jane sent money and food to alleviate the Ryan family's distress.|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Black soon {{signed with}} RCA {{at that time}} {{considered}} one of the [...] "most aggressive" [...] labels in country music. His first album, Killin' Time, was released in 1989. [...] Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. [...] In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin' Time. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, [...] "A Better Man", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked {{at the top of the}} chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, [...] "A Better Man" [...] and [...] "Killin' Time" [...] place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. [...] It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year. Looking back at the early stages of his career, Black recalled: [...] "'At one point, I knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like no matter what happened from that point on <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be remembered for [...] "Killin' Time." [...] There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitement.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jacques {{was a real}} Norman {{with the}} nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa. I asked {{him when he was}} in London if Poulidor, who was often second to Jacques, could ever win the Tour de France: [...] "Yes", he said, [...] "but only if I am riding, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> finish ahead of him.|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony."

I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{couple was}} {{strongly}} criticized for the relationship, and Wrangler {{was accused of}} [...] "turning straight" [...] and entering the relationship simply for money. However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. [...] "I'm not bisexual and I'm not straight", Wrangler later said. [...] "I'm gay, but I could never live a gay lifestyle, because I'm much too competitive. When I was with a guy <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> want {{to be better than}} him: what we were accomplishing, what we were wearing—anything. With a woman you compete like crazy, but coming from different points of view, and as far as I'm concerned, that was doable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{got such}} an {{artificial}} mind," [...] said Mrs. Almond, who always enjoyed {{an opportunity to}} discuss Lavinia's peculiarities with her brother.

It was a working title at beginning, but it kinda worked out in a sense that as a kid, and even if I could now, <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> lived in the basement because it was darker.

5000|$|In February 2016, she {{announced}} that she was {{pulling out of the}} British Olympic rowing programme for Rio 2016, citing her performance, saying [...] "This is not a decision that I've taken lightly. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>always</b> wondered about what might have been if I hadn't given it a go." ...|$|R
2500|$|I practiced {{for many}} years [...] {{exercise}} of recapturing that epiphanic moment, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> find again the same plenitude. I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of melancholy, I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.|$|E
2500|$|One day, her {{youngest}} son, Ken, was misbehaving. Maud ordered Frank to spank the child, and he begrudgingly complied. After Ken {{went to bed}} crying, Frank felt so discomforted that {{he was unable to}} eat dinner. He walked upstairs, woke Ken up, and apologized, saying, [...] "I'll never spank any of you children again." [...] Frank once said that [...] "If I had my way, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> have a young child in the house." [...] Maud rejoined, [...] "If I had my way, I wouldn't!" [...] Because Frank was frequently absent for work-related matters, for most of the time, Maud needed to care for the sons single-handedly. To lessen the burdens of keeping house, Maud also paid a [...] "girl" [...] to help her.|$|E
2500|$|After college, Koons {{moved to}} New York in 1977 {{and worked at}} the {{membership}} desk of the Museum of Modern Art while establishing himself as an artist. During this time, he dyed his hair red and would often cultivate a pencil mustache, after Salvador Dalí. In 1980, he got licensed to sell mutual funds and stocks and began working as a Wall Street commodities broker at First Investors Corporation. After a summer with his parents in Sarasota, Florida (Koons took on a brief job there as a political canvasser), he returned to New York and found a new career as a commodities broker, first at Clayton Brokerage Company and then at Smith Barney. He did this job when he encountered the problem of financing his first series, but also {{in order to be}} independent from the art market: [...] "I could make exactly what art I wanted to make. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> know that I didn't need the art market." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 638, Ma {{was made}} a mid-level {{official}} at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Ma was praised for his alertness and logical thinking, and Emperor Taizong once stated, [...] "If I did not see Ma Zhou for a while, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>always</b> miss him." [...] The chancellor Cen Wenben also stated, [...] "When Mr. Ma analyzes matters, he took examples from both history and current events. He deletes what is not necessary, and then analyzes thoroughly. Nothing should be added and nothing should {{be taken away from}} what he writes. His words are well-written, and one will not get tired of them." [...] In 641, Ma was given three different posts—assistant auditor, imperial advisor, and secretary to Emperor Taizong's son, Li Zhi (the Prince of Jin). After Li Zhi replaced his elder brother, Li Chengqian, as crown prince, Ma {{was made a}}n advisor to the new crown prince as well as deputy head of the legislative bureau.|$|E

I pretended I understood not that also, and put it into the box for the poor. He smiled and went away. Often have I seen him since, and last night, when I left the Mission, he was there again with Father Pedro." ...|$|R
