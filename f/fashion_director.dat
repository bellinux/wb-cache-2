500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive <b>fashion</b> <b>director</b> at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the side}} of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as [...] "side {{cleavage}}", [...] "sidewinders" [...] or [...] "sideboob".

2500|$|The series {{features}} Saunders as Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR {{agent who}} spends her time chasing bizarre fads {{in a desperate}} attempt to stay young and [...] "hip". Edina is joined in her quest by magazine <b>fashion</b> <b>director</b> Patsy Stone (played by Joanna Lumley), her best friend and enabler, whose drug abuse, alcohol consumption, and promiscuity far eclipse Edina's comparatively mild self-destructive behaviour. Despite being a middle-aged, twice-divorced career woman, Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha), a secondary school pupil (and later university student) whose constant care of her mother has left her a bitter cynic. The series also stars June Whitfield as Edina's sarcastic and thieving mother, and Jane Horrocks as Edina's brainless personal assistant.|$|E

Yvie Burnett has been The X Factor vocal coach since series 2, but was replaced in series 7 by Ali Tennant and Savan Kotecha. However, Tennant's contract was ended before the live shows and Burnett was reinstated. In series 7, Richard [...] "Biff" [...] Stannard started work as show song producer for Minogue's contestants, and Grace Woodward joined the series as <b>Fashion</b> <b>Director.</b> Voice-overs are provided by Peter Dickson and Enn Reitel.
