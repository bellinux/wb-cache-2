40|$|Uneven {{distribution}} of permanent magnets (PM) {{is an effective}} way to minimize <b>the</b> <b>cogging</b> torques of PM motors. In this paper a novel and efficient finite element method (FEM) is proposed to calculate <b>the</b> <b>cogging</b> torque of PM motors when the PM distribution is uneven.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a generation method for spatially natural biped walking. By limiting <b>the</b> <b>COG</b> (Center of Gravity) motion space to a sculptured surface, {{the degree of}} freedom of <b>the</b> <b>COG</b> matches to <b>the</b> number of the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) equations. <b>The</b> <b>COG</b> motion can be uniquely generated along a specified surface satisfying the ZMP constraint with low calculation cost. Spatial and time parts are separable by representing motion surface of <b>the</b> <b>COG</b> as parametric variables. The motion surface defines the relative height of <b>the</b> <b>COG</b> from <b>the</b> landing foot position. Thus, the proposed method reflects geometric information directly to the motion planning without considering walk stability. In this paper, we show two actual examples, walking pattern including mostly stretched knee and going up stairs. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simu-lation. Walking with mostly stretched knee is also shown in experiment using HRP- 2. Index Terms—Biped robot, Waking pattern generation, Dynamic walking, Parametric surface I...|$|R
