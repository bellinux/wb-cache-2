5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of turbulence, in 1965 Mobutu used his {{position}} as ANC Chief of Staff to seize power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b> Although Mobutu succeeded in taking power, his position was soon threatened by the Kisangani Mutinies, {{also known as the}} Stanleyville Mutinies or Mercenaries' Mutinies, which were eventually suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, growing {{scrutiny}} of Leopold's regime {{led to a}} popular campaign movement, centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In many cases, the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kisolokele {{was elected}} to the Chamber of Deputies with 733 {{preferential}} votes {{as a member of the}} Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> first election <b>in</b> 1960, representing <b>the</b> Cataractes District. On 20 July he withdrew his parliamentary mandate. He served as a minister of state <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> first independent government under Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. Lumumba's successor, Joseph Iléo, retained Kisolokele in his government in September. In Iléo's second government in February he was appointed minister of parastatals. In April he became the vice-president of the provincial government of Kongo Central. In July he became minister of work and social welfare.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 he rejoined Myton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congos</b> for a live performance, and in 2002, he {{appeared}} on The Slackers' Slackers and Friends album along with Glen Adams, Cornell Campbell, and Ranking Joe. In 2003, Johnson moved into production and set up his own Lion's Den recording studio in Christian Pen, Gregory Park, St. Catherine, and his own Koto Koto Music label. <b>In</b> 2004, <b>The</b> <b>Congos,</b> including Johnson, announced plans to tour <b>the</b> world, and <b>in</b> 2006 they toured Europe and Asia.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{received}} a B.A. degree in history from Emory University in Atlanta in 1965. He {{went on to}} graduate study at Tulane University, earning an M.A. (1968) and a Ph.D. in European history (1971). He spent six months in Brussels in 1969–70 working on his dissertation, Belgian Education Policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> 1945–1960.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b> Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that the reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> was atypical and {{can be attributed to}} the direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
50|$|The Bili Forest lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> far north, about 200 {{kilometers}} {{east of the}} Ebola River, where deep tropical rainforests {{are broken}} by patches of savanna. Dense jungles, civil war, and other barriers to human encroachment have left the region relatively pristine. However, forests throughout <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> have been hit hard by commercial poaching.|$|R
50|$|The Rift valley has exposed an {{enormous}} amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> making it accessible to mining. Cobalt, copper, cadmium, industrial and gem-quality diamonds, gold, silver, zinc, manganese, tin, germanium, uranium, radium, bauxite, iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> southeastern Katanga region.|$|R
50|$|A {{major portion}} of the film takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>Congo,</b> site of {{location}} shooting, where Sister Luke assists Dr. Fortunati in surgical procedures at a mission hospital.The location was Yakusu, a center of missionary and medical activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>Congo.</b>|$|R
5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> {{later in}} the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, provoked by the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in {{the port city of}} Matadi.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of ethically-sourced cobalt, mined {{without the use of}} child workers as is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> the price of cobalt metal had reached a nine-year high in October 2017, at above US$30 a pound, versus US$10 in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Abir {{concession}} {{included the}} Bolombo river, Yekokora river and Lomako river which were tributaries {{of the two}} main rivers. Each concession operated independently and exploited its own area commercially. The other main rubber companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> Free State were the Société Anversoise and the Lulonga Company but Abir was {{the largest in the}} country.|$|E
50|$|Retiring from colonial administration, Wahis {{became a}} {{businessman}} with {{a position in}} a company <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East Indies and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> Compagnie du Katanga. He died in January 1921. A street in Brussels and a street in Menen are named after him.|$|R

50|$|Both groups competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo's</b> first {{parliamentary}} elections in June 1960, in which Lumumba's party {{emerged as the}} largest nationalist faction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Lumumba formed a coalition with the more conservative and federalist ABAKO party led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Lumumba was elected Prime Minister, while Kasa-Vubu became Congo's first President.|$|R
5|$|The South African comics writer Anton Kannemeyer has parodied the {{perceived}} racist {{nature of the}} book to highlight {{what he sees as}} the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his Pappa in Afrika (2010), a satire of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was a {{committed}} non-interventionist who had campaigned {{in opposition to}} expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators. Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dan Blake went on {{to coach}} at Hopkinsville High School in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. While there he was manager of the {{electric}} light and gas plants of the Kentucky Public Service Company. Pritchard coached at LSU for part of one season and was later a Presbyterian dental missionary at Luebo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> until {{he was forced to}} return to the United States due to poor health sometime before 1915.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 and 1954 {{he carried}} out anthropological {{fieldwork}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Belgian <b>Congo.</b> Like Henri Storck and Charles Dekeukeleire, {{he also made}} documentary films about <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|R

5|$|His {{health in}} decline, Lihau sought refuge from {{political}} persecution in the United States in 1985, eventually securing {{a job as}} a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University. He continued to advocate for democracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> and returned to the country in 1990 to discuss political reform. He returned to the United States to seek medical treatment and died there in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the copper}} {{deposits}} in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey. By 2015, DRC supplied 60% {{of the world}} production of 32,000 tons at prices of $20,000 to $26,000 per ton, including artisanal mining which supplied 10 to 25%. The political situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> influences the price of cobalt significantly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing {{it as one of}} Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
50|$|HIV/Aids is {{the most}} serious health problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DR <b>Congo</b> due to <b>the</b> incurable nature of the disease. By the end of 2003, UNAIDS {{estimated}} that 1.1 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, for an overall adult HIV prevalence of 4.2%. Life expectancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DR <b>Congo</b> dropped 9% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s as a result of HIV/AIDS.|$|R

5|$|Reports from Burundi and Angola warn of {{a threat}} to food {{security}} caused by the African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMD). ACMD is responsible for the loss of a million tons of cassava each year. CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b> The FAO emergency relief and rehabilitation program is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant cassava.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Swedish-Belgian Jean-Dadaou Monyas filed {{a similar}} complaint, which was {{supported}} by Afrosvenskarna, an interest group for Swedes of African descent. The complaint to the Chancellor of Justice was turned down as violations of hate speech restrictions in the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression must be filed within one year of publication, and the latest Swedish edition of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> appeared in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the United Nations Operation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> (ONUC) was {{initially}} welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered peacekeeping. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought {{the assistance of the}} United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b> Lumumba's actions distanced him {{from the rest of the}} government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.|$|E
