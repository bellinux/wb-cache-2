40|$|In complex systems, e. g., in {{logistic}} <b>hubs,</b> <b>cars</b> or factories, {{there is}} a need for real time decision support. In present approaches the transfer and storage process and subsequent analysis of data in real time is not possible. One reason is that data sources can fail and thus the information flow is interrupted. Furthermore {{there is a}} large divergence of the data amount generated by data streams coming from different data sources, e. g. sensors, relational databases and mobile devices. We offer an architecture to eliminate these problems. Therefore we introduce a classification of the data sources that enables an appropriate handling of the specific data source’s properties...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{recent years}} the problem of traffic {{congestion}} and its management has become increasingly prominent. It is a hot research {{about how to make}} full use of computer simulation technology to make transportation more rational and more organized. In this paper, we focus on traffic of Beijing West Railway Station north area, and {{try to find a way}} to reduce traffic congestion in this area. Approach: In this paper, we studied the traffic flow by survey. We also built a traffic simulation model with VISSIM software. Different types of vehicles and their speed are set in model according survey data. The simulation model provides different traffic scenarios of Beijing West Railway Station north area. Findings: We found the traffic of this area up is to 1800 vehicles/hour. Heavy traffic burden causes traffic congestion in two positions: the bus <b>hub</b> and <b>car</b> drop-off point. If we can extend bus interval departure time and park cars to south square of Beijing West Railway Station, the traffic condition will be improved. Originality : This paper gives a solution to reduce traffic congestion in Beijing West Railway Station north area. The bus <b>hub</b> and <b>car</b> parking lots are the key point of traffic problem in this area. </p...|$|R

In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a <b>hub</b> for <b>car</b> and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it had been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|R

The contract was awarded to Tulloch Limited, Rhodes who built the 28 carriages numbered 2212 to 2239 between 1947 and 1949, and formed into four sets of seven carriages.

50|$|With the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} automobile in the 1920s, Central became a <b>hub</b> for <b>car</b> dealerships, service stations, and related enterprise. This role increased dramatically in 1937 when, with New Deal funding secured by governor Clyde Tingley, Route 66 through Albuquerque was realigned from Fourth Street to a more direct east-west route along Central. The road was extended west across the Rio Grande and paved along its entire length, while the grade crossing downtown was eliminated with a new underpass. Dozens of new motels, diners, and filling stations sprang up along East and West Central to cater to the steady stream of travelers passing through the city. By 1955, there were 98 motels along Central Avenue.|$|R

50|$|The centerbore of a {{wheel is}} the size of the hole {{in the back of the}} wheel that centers it over the {{mounting}} <b>hub</b> of the <b>car.</b> Some factory wheels have a centerbore that matches exactly with the hub to reduce vibration by keeping the wheel centered. Wheels with the correct centerbore to the car they will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the lug nuts, reducing the job of the lug nuts to center the wheel to the car. Wheels that are not hubcentric are known as lugcentric, as the job of centering is done by the lug nuts assuming they are properly torqued down.|$|R

In that year, the New Zeil was built as a wide commercial street leading from Konstablerwache to the east towards Friedberger Anlage (the eastern section of the old city wall). Between the New Zeil and Allerheiligenstraße there was a small square, which was far smaller than the modern square.

50|$|Further {{development}} of the Type 62 took place during 1939, including a more angular body design, and pre-production models were field-tested in the invasion of Poland, that started in September that year. Despite their overall satisfaction with the vehicle's performance, military commanders demanded that a few important changes be made: the lowest {{speed of the vehicle}} had to be reduced from 8 km/h to 4 km/h as an adjustment to the pace of marching soldiers. Second, it needed some improvement of its off-road ability. Porsche responded to both requests by mounting new axles with gear-reduction <b>hubs,</b> providing the <b>car</b> with more torque and more ground-clearance all at once. Revised dampers, 41 cm wheels, and a limited slip differential, as well as countless small modifications, completed the specification. In order to reflect the changes, the vehicle was renamed Type 82.|$|R

Close analysis of this practice suggests that Lebanese immigrant traders are to a large extent driven by the ideal of enjoying life by adopting an expatriate lifestyle...|$|R

50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 51. McMurray didn't get a {{good start}} and was about spun out by Joey Logano. This allowed teammate Brad Keselowski to retake the lead. Danica Patrick took her car to the garage on lap 60 after the left-front <b>hub</b> of her <b>car</b> burned out. Kyle Busch made an unscheduled stop for a tire vibration on lap 63. The culprit was a loose left-rear wheel. Kevin Harvick made a charge at the lead, but Brad Keselowski was able to lead the entire third segment as the third caution of the race flew to conclude segment 3. Everybody pitted under this caution. Matt Kenseth exited with the lead. Greg Biffle and Tony Stewart were tagged for speeding on pit road and Dale Earnhardt Jr. was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon. All three restarted the race from the tail-end of the field.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{negative}} pulse voltage on the microstructure and corrosion resistance of microarc oxidation film of A 356 aluminum alloy treated by microarc technique was investigated by SEM, coating thickness gauge and electrochemical workstation etc. The results show the negative pulse voltage greatly influences the microstructure and corrosion resistance of microarc oxidation film by its electrode reaction. The film thickness increases while {{the size of}} pore and roughness of the film surface decreases initially and then increases with negative pulse voltage increasing. The microarc oxidation treatment considerably improved corrosion resistance, and the highest corrosion potential was- 1. 16 V, which was 0. 38 V {{higher than that of}} substrate, and the corrosion current was lower than that of substrate about three orders of magnitude. Microarc oxidation combines electrochemical oxidation with a high voltage spark treatment to form a protective ceramic coating on the surface of valve metals such as Al, Ti, Mg, which can considerably enhance wear-resistant and corrosion resistance of the metals. It is simple, energy saving and environmentally friendly. Therefore, microarc oxidation becomes a hot research topic in surface treatment [1 - 4]. Many works focus on the technique parameters research in microarc oxidation [5 - 7]. We presented here the effect of negative pulse voltage on thickness, morphology and corrosion resistance of oxide coating formed on A 356 aluminum alloy which possessed good mechanical and corrosion resistance. The work disclosed some useful technical results for microarc oxidation on aluminum alloy that was used as preferred materials for manufacturing <b>hubs</b> of <b>cars</b> and motors...|$|R
