5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours, and {{involved}} innovative tactics and technology. By {{the end of}} the day, the IAF had destroyed 29 of 30 SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley and shot down between 82–86 enemy aircraft with minimal losses. The battle led the United States to impose a ceasefire on <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria.</b>|$|E
5|$|The IAF {{began working}} on a SAM {{suppression}} operation {{since the end of}} the Yom Kippur War. Rising tensions between <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying the SAM batteries in the Beqaa Valley. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, and on the third day of the war, with clashes going on between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian Army, Israel decided to launch the operation.|$|E

5|$|The battles began {{shortly after}} the Israeli {{declaration}} of independence, when Syria shelled Ein Gev {{on the night of}} May 15–16. They were the first military engagement between <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria.</b> On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Samakh (Tzemah), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet. After reaching a stalemate, they retreated to their initial position in Tel al-Qasr, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Yom Kippur War {{ended on}} October 24. 69 Squadron had flown 789 sorties, had lost 9 aircraft, and had shot down 10 enemy aircraft. Four airmen {{had been killed}} and eight had become prisoners of war. The end of the war, however, did not spell {{an end to the}} fighting. On December 6, a mixed 69 and 119 squadrons combat air patrol over the Gulf of Suez engaged a flight of MiG-21s to score one kill, {{possibly}} two. The kill was credited to 69's Yiftach Shadmi and Meir Gur, with the MiG-21s revealed {{to be a part of}} a North Korean contingent that had deployed to Egypt during the war. With the arrival of spring fighting also resumed in the north, where <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> had yet to sign a disengagement agreement. On April 8, 1974, while on patrol against low flying Syrian helicopters, the squadron lost one of its aircraft, probably to a shoulder-launched SA-7. The crew, Shadmi and Rafaeli, were interned in Lebanon for a month. Three weeks later, on April 29, the squadron scored two aerial kills against Syrian MiG-21s, the squadron's final victories to date. Fighting only ceased on May 31.|$|E

25|$|Fighting between Maronite and Palestinian forces (mainly {{from the}} Palestine Liberation Organization) began in 1975, then Leftist, pan-Arabist and Muslim Lebanese groups formed an {{alliance}} with the Palestinians. During {{the course of the}} fighting, alliances shifted rapidly and unpredictably. Furthermore, foreign powers, such as <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria,</b> became involved in the war and fought alongside different factions. Peace keeping forces, such as the Multinational Force in Lebanon & UNIFIL, were also stationed in Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|In the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Syria {{attempted}} {{to recapture the}} Golan Heights militarily, but the attempt was unsuccessful. <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> signed a ceasefire agreement in 1974 that left almost all the Heights under Israeli control, while returning a narrow demilitarized zone to Syrian control. A United Nations observation force was established in 1974 as a buffer between the sides. By Syrian formal acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 338, which set out the cease-fire {{at the end of}} the Yom Kippur War, Syria also accepted Resolution 242.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 Lebanon War was {{at first}} a {{conventional}} war {{up to and including}} when the PLO were expelled from Beirut. The war was limited by both <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> because they were determined to isolate the fighting, not allowing it to turn into an all-out war. Israeli forces were numerically superior, allowing Israel to maintain both the initiative and an element of surprise. The Syrian Army fielded six divisions and 500 aircraft, while Israel used five divisions and two brigades, plus 600 aircraft. There were numerous other factions involved.|$|E
25|$|On June 11, <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> {{announced}} that they had agreed to a cease-fire at noon, which would not include the PLO. The cease-fire was to come into effect at noon. Just before the cease-fire was to take effect, the Syrians moved a column of T-72 tanks so as to position it against Israeli forces in the valley. Israeli infantry teams armed with BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles ambushed the Syrian column, destroying 11 tanks. Another air battle also occurred, with the Israelis shooting down 18 more Syrian jets.|$|E

50|$|The 1949 Armistice Agreements which {{followed}} the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, created three demilitarized zones on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, {{and also the}} largest, stretched from the south-eastern part of the Sea of Galilee eastwards to the Yarmuk River where the borders of <b>Israel,</b> Jordan <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> converge. The issue of water sharing from the Jordan-Yarmuk system {{turned out to be}} a major problem between <b>Israel,</b> <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> Jordan.|$|R
25|$|The Armistice Line between <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> {{left the}} Haifa – Samakh {{section of the}} 1050mm gauge Jezreel Valley line in Israeli-controlled territory. Israel Railways {{continued}} using parts of this route on an irregular basis until the early 1950s {{at which point the}} entire line was abandoned as it was the only narrow gauge line left in the Israeli network. In 2011–2016 the section between Haifa and Beisan was rebuilt in standard gauge along roughly the same route as the Ottoman era one, although the rest of the route along the Jordan River from Beisan to Samakh remains dismantled and has not been reopened.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 peace {{agreement}} {{did not last}} long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurdish rebels, pushing them close to the border with Iran. As in the First Iraqi-Kurdish War, the Kurds received material support from Iran and Israel. Israel regarded the Iraqi military as a possible threat in case of renewed fighting between <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> (during the 1973 War about one third of Iraq's army {{had been sent to}} fight against Israel on the Syrian front) and so wished to keep the Iraqis occupied elsewhere. Iran wished to strengthen its own political and military position vis-à-vis Iraq—the only other regional power in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between <b>Israel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syria</b> was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E
