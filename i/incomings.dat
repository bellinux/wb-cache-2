The difference between a country with money, and a country altogether without it, would be only one of convenience; a saving of time and trouble, like grinding by water instead of by hand, or (to use Adam Smith’s illustration) like the benefit derived from roads; and to mistake money for wealth is the same sort of error as to mistake the highway, which may be the easiest way of getting to your house or lands, for the house and lands themselves.|$|E

The chances were better with the outgoings than with the <b>incomings,</b> for these were apt to be so hurried, in the final result of his constitutional delays, as to have the rapidity of the homing pigeon's flight, and to afford hardly a glimpse to the quickest eye. It cannot harm him, or any one now, to own that Harte was nearly always late for those luncheons and dinners which he was always going out to, and it needed the anxieties and energies of both families to get him into his clothes, {{and then into the}} carriage where a good deal of final buttoning must have been done, in order that he might not arrive so very late.

5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the <b>incoming</b> register in R2 parlance. The outgoing register transmits forward MF tones to the <b>incoming</b> register. The <b>incoming</b> register transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing register. The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the <b>incoming</b> register. The <b>incoming</b> register detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the <b>incoming</b> register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing register's first push signal to the <b>incoming</b> register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the <b>incoming</b> register's pull signals, which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the <b>incoming</b> register and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|R
