5|$|Non-native plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources. Though <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> are most {{commonly found in}} areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time consuming and expensive.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. <b>Exotic</b> <b>species</b> currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of <b>exotic</b> <b>species,</b> while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
40|$|Invasive <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> {{are often}} {{expected}} to benefit exclusively from legacy {{effects of their}} litter inputs on soil processes and nutrient availability. However, there are relatively few experimental tests determining how litter of exotic plants affects their own growth conditions compared to congeneric native plant species. Here, we test how the legacy of litter from three <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> affects their own performance in comparison to their congeneric natives that co-occur in the invaded habitat. We also analyzed litter effects on soil processes. In all three comparisons, soil with litter from <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> had the highest respiration rates. In two out of the three exotic-native species comparisons, soil with litter from <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> had higher inorganic nitrogen concentrations than their native congener, which was likely due to higher initial litter quality of the exotics. When litter from an <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> had {{a positive effect on}} itself, it also had a positive effect on its native congener. We conclude that <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> develop a legacy effect in soil from the invaded range through their litter inputs. This litter legacy effect results in altered soil processes that can promote both the <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> and their native congener. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{introduced}} <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> may be released from their native soil-borne pathogens, but that they become exposed to increased soil pathogen activity in the new range when time since introduction increases. Other {{studies have shown}} that introduced <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> become less dominant when time since introduction increases, and that plant abundance may be controlled by soil-borne pathogens; however, no study yet has tested whether these soil effects might explain the decline in dominance of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> following their initial invasiveness. Here we determine plant–soil feedback of 20 plant species that have been introduced into The Netherlands. We tested the hypotheses that (i) <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> with a longer residence time have a more negative soil feedback and (ii) greater local dominance of the introduced <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> correlates with less negative, or more positive, plant–soil feedback. Although the local dominance of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> decreased with time since introduction, there was no relationship of local dominance with plant–soil feedback. Plant–soil feedback also did not become more negative with increasing time since introduction. We discuss why our results may deviate from some earlier published studies and why plant–soil feedback may not in all cases, or not in all comparisons, explain patterns of local dominance of introduced <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species...</b>|$|R

5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as cholera which emerged in 1992 in India.

50|$|Wholly {{freshwater}} galaxiids are gravely {{threatened by}} <b>exotic</b> salmonid <b>species,</b> particularly <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species,</b> which prey heavily upon them and compete {{with them for}} food and habitat. This is a major concern, as <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species</b> have been introduced to many different land masses (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) with no thought as to impacts on native fish such as galaxiids, and no attempt to preserve some exotic trout-free habitats for native fish.|$|R

5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} <b>exotic</b> <b>species.</b> An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exotic</b> <b>species</b> of fauna such as {{the zebra}} and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways.|$|E
50|$|In most situations, wholly {{freshwater}} galaxiids {{are unable}} to persist {{in the presence of}} <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species,</b> and many are now restricted to the few remaining trout-free habitats. Where these species are found in the presence of trout, the galaxiids usually consist entirely of individuals which dispersed there from an upstream trout-free population, and are not self-sustaining. Numerous localised extinctions of wholly freshwater galaxiid species (i.e. mountain galaxias) have been caused by the introduction of <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species</b> (including ongoing illegal stockings) and a number of wholly freshwater galaxiid species are threatened with extinction by <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species</b> and other <b>exotic</b> salmonids.|$|R
50|$|In Tasmanian rivers spotted galaxias {{numbers are}} {{severely}} depressed when <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species</b> are present (Ault & White, 1994). This {{is a common}} phenomena; galaxias species that manage to survive the presence of <b>exotic</b> trout (many <b>species</b> do not) such as spotted galaxias are forced into sub-optimal feeding locations, feeding times and diets by aggressive competition from <b>exotic</b> trout <b>species</b> (McDowall, 2006). Galaxias populations in such situations tend to display lower than normal growth, size and fecundity, raising concerns for their long-term future (McDowall, 2006).|$|R
50|$|As with {{everywhere}} else, {{the park}} {{struggles with the}} management of <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species.</b> <b>Exotic</b> plants first appeared when Native Americans and Euro-Americans cleared the forests. Many exotic plants are introduced accidentally but a few were planted deliberately. <b>Exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> include leafy spurge, Canada thistle and sweet clover. The park is currently conducting an inventory and monitoring program to gather information on the {{plant and animal species}} present within the park. From this information, the managers will be able to best decide how to manage and control the exotic invasive plants.|$|R
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of <b>exotic</b> <b>species,</b> and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, <b>exotic</b> <b>species,</b> air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exotic</b> <b>species</b> (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E

5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by <b>exotic</b> <b>species,</b> {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
40|$|Between November 2008 and February 2010, Mexico {{made several}} {{modifications}} to existing environmental and wildlife regulations regarding invasive species. On November 2008, the Deputy Chamber made several {{modifications to the}} Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection General Law (LGEEPA by its Spanish acronym; equivalent to NEPA), and the Wildlife General Law. These modifications {{were published in the}} Federal Register until February 2010. The intent of these modifications was to strengthen existing regulations by incorporating more specific language dealing with invasive species and make these regulations more in tune with other regulations outside of the wildlife arena, such as the Forestry, Human Health, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Economic, Biosecurity of Genetically Modified Organisms, Animal and Plant Health, and Foreign Commerce laws. Highlights of these modifications: -It defines an <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species</b> as: “A species or population that is not native and it is found outside of its natural distribution range. It is capable of surviving, reproducing, and establishing itself in natural habitats and ecosystems and threatens the native biological diversity, economy or human health. ” -Prohibits the importation of <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species</b> or any other wild species that can carry an <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species</b> and represent a threat to biodiversity, the economy, and human health. -Prohibits the release into the wild of <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species.</b> -Mandates the creation of a list of <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species</b> that has to be reviewed every 3 years or earlier if needed (NOTE: There are currently more than 1, 000 species considered as invasive in Mexico with fishes and plants comprising the largest numbers). -Mandates the creation of a regulation on prevention of entry of these species, management, control and eradication of those <b>exotic</b> invasive <b>species</b> which are already established in Mexico. -Gives the Economy Ministry the power to control transit of these species inside Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Aim - To {{estimate}} invasiveness of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species,</b> {{many studies}} have used the frequency of occurrence within a defined region. This measure is informative on how widespread exotics are, however, it does not inform on their local dominance, which is crucial for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The aim {{of the present study}} is to determine if regional frequency of occurrence of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> indeed is indicative of their local dominance. We also determined which plant traits and other factors predict regional and local frequencies best. Location - The Netherlands. Methods - We used information on <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> established in The Netherlands and compared traits relating to their frequency of occurrence regionally (the entire country) and their frequency of dominance locally (in 1 – 100 m 2 quadrats). We created minimal adequate models with factors explaining regional frequency and frequency of local dominance of 111 <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> in The Netherlands. Results - The model that used plant traits to explain regional frequency of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> differed from the models that best explained their frequency of local dominance. Regionally, the factors that correlated with frequency were: life form, height, polyploidy, length of flowering season, residence time, human use and origin. The factors that correlated to frequency of local dominance were lateral vegetative spread and residence time. Main conclusions - We conclude that plant traits relating to the regional frequency of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>species</b> differ from those that relate to their frequency of local dominance. The implication of our results is that predictive studies on plant invasiveness based on regional frequencies may not be indicative of the local impacts. Since the prediction of local impacts is crucial for conservation and risk assessment, our study emphasized the need for better information on the local abundance of exotic invader...|$|R

5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Namib Desert Horse is unclear, though several {{theories}} have been put forward. Genetic tests have been performed, although none to date have completely verified their origin. The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses, many from German breeding programs, released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century, especially during World War I. Whatever their origin, the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains, near Aus, Namibia, {{the location of a}} man-made water source. They were generally ignored by humans, except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat, until the 1980s. In 1984, the first aerial survey of the population was made, and in 1986, their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park. At several points, some horses have been removed from the herd, including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992. Since the early 1990s, close records of the population have been kept, and studies have been performed to determine the horses' effect on their environment. Despite being considered an <b>exotic</b> <b>species</b> within the park, they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country's history and draw as a tourist attraction.|$|E
