This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known.

This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.|$|E
2500|$|After Graduation, Danqun Fang {{began his}} {{scientific}} work at Beijing Municipal Institute of Labor Protection. In the 1960s, he successfully developed {{a series of}} mufflers {{that could be used}} in industry environment. On the basis of the sound absorption theory of Micro perforated plate proposed by Prof. Daa-You Maa, Danqun Fang successfully developed a series of micro-perforated plate mufflers, which was widely used for sound absorption. From the 1970s, Danqun Fang led a team of acousticians, physiologists and doctors to research the influence of noise on hearing, cardiovascular, nervous system. After working out series of relationship between noise and brain, noise and deafness, noise and neurasthenia, he proposed noise standard for all places in industrial enterprise plants in China. His work led to the issue of the first China National Noise Standard for Industry in 1980. Five years later, with more comprehensive research by analyzing 11794 noise sources of 1034 factories and investigating noise <b>exposure</b> <b>conditions</b> of 62726 workers, Danqun Fang drew up “Industrial Noise Control Design Specification” for China, which was named as [...]|$|E

40|$|Social phobia is a newly defined disorder, and {{treatments}} for it typically involve pharmacotherapy or {{some form of}} in vivo exposure.

30|$|The {{notion of}} superstitious {{behavior}} {{can provide a}} basic background for understanding such notions as illusions and beliefs. The present study investigated the social mechanism of the transmission of superstitious behavior in an experiment that utilized participant replacement. The sample was composed {{of a total of}} 38 participants. Participants performed a task on a computer: they could click a colored rectangle using the mouse. When the rectangle was in a particular color, the participants received points independently of their behavior (variable time schedule). When the color of the rectangle was changed, no points were presented (extinction). Under an Individual <b>Exposure</b> <b>condition,</b> ten participants worked alone on the task. Other participants were exposed to the same experimental task under a Social <b>Exposure</b> <b>condition,</b> in which each participant first learned by observation and then worked on the task in a participant replacement (chain) procedure. The first participant in each chain in the Social <b>Exposure</b> <b>condition</b> was a confederate who worked on the task “superstitiously,” clicking the rectangle when points were presented. Superstitious responding was transmitted because of the behavior of the confederate. This also influenced estimates of personal control. These findings suggest that social learning can facilitate the acquisition and maintenance of superstitious behavior and the illusion of control. Our data also suggest that superstitious behavior and the illusion of control may involve similar learning principles.|$|R

40|$|Neophobia, {{the fear}} of novelty, is a {{behavioral}} trait displayed by many animal species, in which novel stimuli are perceived to have aversive properties. This is typically associated {{with an increase in}} emotional reactivity (i. e. fearfulness). In this study, we investigated whether early postnatal exposure to a novel visual stimulus could reduce neophobia in bobwhite quail chicks (Colinus virginianus). The experiment consisted of three conditions which consisted of a no stimulus control, a test-only exposure control, and a postnatal <b>exposure</b> <b>condition.</b> The stimulus utilized was a moving decoy of a predatory hawk in flight, and was presented to chicks in the <b>exposure</b> <b>condition</b> from hatching to testing at 24 hrs of age. We predicted that chicks exposed to the hawk model would exhibit less emotional reactivity than both groups of naïve control chicks. All chicks were tested individually within a novel emergence box and Tmaze apparatus. Results showed statistically significant differences between the groups tested {{in the presence of the}} visual stimulus (test-only exposure control and postnatal <b>exposure</b> <b>condition).</b> Exposed chicks displayed significantly greater distances traveled (p = 0. 010), greater mean velocity (p = 0. 010), and decreased immobile duration (p = 0. 027) when compared to naïve chicks tested under identical conditions (i. e. hawk present). Taken together, these results indicate that chicks exposed to the novel visual stimulus following hatching showed decreased emotional reactivity (less fearfulness) during subsequent testing than did naïve chicks. Our results suggest that exposure to novel stimuli can moderate the development of neophobia during early life experience...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe neural {{efficiency}} hypothesis postulates a {{more efficient}} use of brain resources in more intelligent people as compared to less intelligent ones. However, this relationship {{was found to be}} moderated by sex and task content. While the phenomenon of neural efficiency was previously supported for men when performing visuo-spatial tasks it occurred for women only when performing verbal tasks. One possible explanation for this finding could be provided by the well-studied phenomenon called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat arises when a negative stereotype of one’s own group is made salient and can result in behavior that confirms the stereotype. Overall, 32 boys and 31 girls of varying intellectual ability were tested with a mental rotation task, either under a stereotype exposure or a no-stereotype <b>exposure</b> <b>condition</b> while measuring their EEG. The behavioral results show that an activated negative stereotype not necessarily hampers the performance of girls. Physiologically, a confirmation of the neural efficiency phenomenon was only obtained for boys working under a no-stereotype <b>exposure</b> <b>condition.</b> This result pattern replicates previous findings without threat and thus suggests that sex differences in neural efficiency during visuo-spatial tasks may not be due to the stereotype threat effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{contribution}} of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) from a laser-sustained plasma on mass loss phenomenon of fluorinated polymer in the ground-based laser-detonation atomic oxygen (AO) beam source was evaluated. The AO beam and EUV/VUV from an oxygen plasma {{were separated by}} a high-speed chopper wheel installed in the beam source. Mass changes of fluorinated polymer and polyimide were measured from the frequency shift of the quartz crystal microbalances during the beam exposures. It has been {{made clear that the}} fluorinated polymer is eroded by EUV/VUV exposure alone. In contrast, no erosion was detected for polyimide by EUV/VUV alone. The AO-induced erosion was measured for both materials even without EUV/VUV exposure. However, no strong synergistic ef-fect was observed for the fluorinated polymer even under the simultaneous <b>exposure</b> <b>condition</b> of AO and EUV/VUV. Similar results were observed even in the simultaneous <b>exposure</b> <b>condition</b> of AO (without EUV/VUV from the laser plasma) and VUV from the 172 nm excimer lamp and D 2 lamp. These experi-mental results suggest that the primary origin of the accelerated erosion of fluorinated polymer observed in the laser detonation AO source is not EUV/VUV from the laser-sustained plasma...|$|R
