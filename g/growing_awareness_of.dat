5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the {{benefits}} of retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal {{as part of the}} creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then there had been <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 {{match is}} memorable less for what {{happened}} during the game itself as {{for what happened}} on the park after the game. The Scottish fans invaded the pitch, ripping up large sections of it and tearing down the goalposts. This incident contributed towards the <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> football hooliganism in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009, Neville Howard and Gavin Norman {{created an}} {{independent}} supporter group to <b>grow</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the bid at a grassroots level. The Rebel Army networked via Facebook and Twitter; in early 2011 the Facebook page was liked by 4500 fans and 600 Twitter followers.|$|R
5000|$|Out {{of these}} field studies <b>grew</b> <b>Awareness</b> <b>of</b> Dying, a theory on the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> on the interaction with dying people. It differentiated between closed awareness, suspicion, mutual deception, and open awareness. The field studies {{had shown that}} the type <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> {{had a significant impact}} on interaction [...] - [...] for instance, if patients were not aware of their dying, the nursing was often limited to the absolutely necessary in order to prevent open awareness.|$|R
40|$|A rising {{standard}} of living and political ideologies <b>grew</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> human needs and social values (UKGP 1998). The UNCHS (1996) made a “global call to action ” for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements for all, pinning the onus on the authorities. Reaffirming the principles for governance and progress worldwide, commitment by nations to a global partnership to reduce poverty (UN, 2000) has more failures than successe...|$|R
25|$|In {{recent times}} {{there has been}} a {{movement}} of population from rural areas to urban centres of industry, leading to price rise in property in various cities of India. Urban housing in India balances space constrictions and is aimed to serve the working class. <b>Growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> ecology has influenced architecture in India during modern times.|$|E
25|$|The horizons of American {{art in the}} late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century {{expanded}} rapidly, {{fueled by}} major artistic advances in Europe. Before 1920, French Impressionism {{was one of the}} most important influences at work in cutting-edge American art circles. With a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> Impressionism as a valid approach to depicting nature, many prominent artists in the eastern United States adopted its tenets, leading to a recognized school of American Impressionism. The ACMAA collection contains several examples of American Impressionism by some of the genre’s most accomplished painters.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were challenged by downturns in economic growth, a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> poverty and unemployment present within modern industrial cities and also by the agitation of organized labour. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold—became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
50|$|Attention {{to social}} {{equity in the}} field of public {{administration}} in the United States arose during the 1960s, amid <b>growing</b> national <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> civil rights and racial inequality.|$|R

25|$|The name Blue River {{began to}} be applied in the 18th century, {{apparently}} owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of Jiang, Jiangkou, or Yangzijiang. Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.|$|E
25|$|There was now <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> Pullen's abilities, {{but it was}} the European {{recording}} {{companies that}} were prepared to preserve them. In 1975 an Italian record company gave Pullen, George Adams, and Dannie Richmond the opportunity to each make a recording under his own name. All three collaborated in the others' recordings. In the same year, Pullen made two further solo recordings in Italy, Five To Go (Horo) and Healing Force (Black Saint), the latter being received with great acclaim. He became part of the regular seasonal tours of American musicians to Europe, playing in the avant-garde or free mode.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the {{environmental}} impact of many chemicals had led to a politically powerful environmental movement. Some labor leaders seized on the public's growing unease over chemicals in the environment, arguing that the effect of these compounds on worker health was even worse than the low-level exposure plants and animals received in the wild. On January 23, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson submitted a comprehensive occupational health and safety bill to Congress. Led by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, the legislation was widely opposed by business. Many labor leaders, including the leadership of the AFL-CIO, did not fight for the legislation, claiming workers had little interest in the bill. The legislation died in committee.|$|E

25|$|Some local {{opposition}} to nuclear power {{emerged in the}} early 1960s, and in the late 1960s {{some members of the}} scientific community began to express their concerns. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, West Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired {{opposition to}} nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s and while opposition to nuclear power continues, increasing public support for nuclear power has re-emerged over the last decade in light of <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> global warming and renewed interest in all types of clean energy (see the Pro-nuclear movement).|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{redevelopment}} {{plan in the}} West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic Go-tiau-kang area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> {{the need to protect}} Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.|$|E
25|$|<b>Growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> volcanism, {{especially}} {{the threat from}} volcanoes in the United States, {{has led to a}} number of changes in the way Canadians are dealing with volcanic hazards. For example, The Barrier, an unstable lava dam retaining the Garibaldi Lake system of southwestern British Columbia, has in the past unleashed several debris flows, most recently in 1855–1856. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan, Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people. It focuses primarily on aviation safety because jet aircraft can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash. The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events. Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall.|$|E
50|$|The OAU did {{not react}} {{to the death of}} their former Secretary General.However, the {{disappearance}} of Telli, a widely respected international diplomat known for his dignity and good nature, did contribute to <b>growing</b> international <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the abuses of the Touré regime.|$|R

500|$|By {{this date}} medieval {{architecture}} {{was back in}} fashion. A <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the value of England’s medieval heritage had begun in the late 18th century, leading to some work {{on a number of}} the cathedrals by the architect James Wyatt.|$|E
500|$|As {{a tourist}} destination, Bahrain {{received}} over eight million visitors in 2008 though {{the exact number}} varies yearly.

500|$|Humanist historians {{argued that}} {{contemporary}} scholarship restored direct {{links to the}} classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named {{for the first time}} the [...] "Middle Ages". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas (middle times). The term la rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568). Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains Cimabue, Giotto, and Arnolfo di Cambio; the second phase contains Masaccio, Brunelleschi, and Donatello; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo. It was not just the <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.|$|E

500|$|There was a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> {{geography}} and political boundaries in this period. Scotland was extensively mapped {{for the first}} time. In {{the last quarter of}} the sixteenth century, Timothy Pont created a series of sketch maps of Scotland and recorded the names and details of 20,000 places he visited or noted. His work became the basis for the set of maps of Scotland published the following century by Willem and Johannes Blaeu. In the eighteenth century, there was a [...] "militarisation of cartography", by which the armed forces took over the business of mapping. One response to the Jacobite risings in 1715 and 1745 was the Ordnance Survey, from which over 800 military plans survive for Scotland. The new generation of cartographers were engineers and military surveyors.|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{reviewed}} {{the book and}} compared McLeod's tactic of following his trademarked phrase with [...] "®" [...] as a satire of [...] Fox Network's registration of the phrase [...] "fair and balanced" [...] as a trademark. The reviewer wrote, [...] "While McLeod's arguments aren't original, his entertaining examples and punchy writing nicely amplify the concerns voiced by {{an increasing number of}} intellectual property scholars, such as Lawrence Lessig." [...] The reviewer said of the author's tone, [...] "Although he evokes dark, almost Orwellian images throughout, McLeod manages an upbeat spin, citing the 'egalitarian' nature of the new technologies and a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the need to return to a place where 'freedom of expression' is once again 'a meaningful concept that guides our political, social and creative lives.'" ...|$|E

He added that the people involved were not [...] "so uninformed that they mistake science fiction for simulated murder", a notion which he stated was present in gamers' reactions and implied in Sony's apology. He elaborated that the controversy came from the use of assault weaponry in a place of worship, one that plays host to a yearly candlelight vigil for victims of gun violence. He wrote that the [...] "jarring image of an American supersoldier spraying their church with bullets may indeed seem less like a meaningless violation of 'whiny dogma' than a sick joke." [...] He added that, the controversy, while [...] "ridiculous to Sony and the videogame community", demonstrates a <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> religion in a [...] "virtual place", even among the [...] "severest critics of videogames".|$|E
