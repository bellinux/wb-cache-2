50|$|Analogue {{theatrical}} {{lighting control}} (pre-dating {{the more recent}} digital control protocols such as DMX) commonly used the 8-pin (45°) DIN connector, six of the pins being 0-10V control signals for six separate dimmer circuits, {{and the other two}} a 0V reference and a DC source for powering simple circuitry in rudimentary lighting desks. Pinouts vary between manufacturers: Zero 88, Anytronics, Lightprocessor and Strand have the control signals <b>on</b> <b>pins</b> 1-6, 0V <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> 8 and power <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> 7 and Pulsar and Clay Paky have power <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> 1, 0V <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> 2 and channel outputs <b>on</b> <b>pins</b> 3 to 8.

50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> connector number 2 and receive <b>on</b> <b>pin</b> connector number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: pin connector number 2 receives and pin connector number 3 transmits the signals.|$|R

If so, {{there are a variety}} of ways to compute the average score of a bowling game, including methods that account for a bowler’s skill level. In this thesis, we discuss several different ways to generate bowling scores randomly. For each distribution, we give results for the expected value and standard deviation of each frame 2 ̆ 7 s score, the expected value of the game’s final score, and the correlation coefficient between the score of the first and second roll of a single frame. Furthermore, we shall generalize the results in each distribution for an frame game <b>on</b> <b>pins.</b> Additionally, we shall generalize the number of possible games when bowling frames <b>on</b> <b>pins.</b> Then, we shall derive the frequency distribution of each frame’s scores and the arithmetic mean for frames <b>on</b> <b>pins.</b> Finally, to summarize the variety of distributions, we shall make tables that display the results obtained from each distribution used to model a particular bowler’s score. We evaluate the special case when bowling 10 frames <b>on</b> 10 <b>pins,</b> which represents a standard bowling game...|$|R

Some large manufacturers of MIDI devices use modified MIDI in-only DIN 5-pin sockets with the metallic conductors intentionally omitted at pin positions 1, 2, and 3 so that the maximum voltage isolation is obtained.|$|R
