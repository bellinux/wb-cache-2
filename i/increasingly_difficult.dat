5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to retain their}} best players as {{salaries}} escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary {{has always been one}} of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E

Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E
5|$|Golden Sun also {{features}} an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen. In this mode, players can enter {{a team from}} their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> CPU-controlled enemies.

The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles.|$|E
5|$|The French Republican {{position}} became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult.</b> Compounding {{problems in}} international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.|$|E

Players can gain access to increasingly advanced armor and weapons as they progress through these multiplayer matches. Microtransactions are also featured, allowing players to purchase in-game upgrades with real-life currency.|$|E

All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E

In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, football continued but competitions were reduced in size as many players were drafted to the German Wehrmacht. Most Gauligen split into subgroups to reduce travel, which became <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> as the war went on.|$|R
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E
50|$|People {{depended}} on agriculture and animal husbandry. Agriculture became <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> {{due to the}} steady soil subsidence.

5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to stage}} her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost {{revealed}} at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean {{to avoid the}} humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult.</b> By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of our era, the old course of the Rhine between Utrecht and Harmelen became <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> to navigate.

5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive multiplayer mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative multiplayer mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves of <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were removed. A Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom challenges for the game's co-operative multiplayer. However, Crytek announced {{that the development of}} this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E

She has stated that she prefers being backstage over giving concerts, as {{she does not have}} to wear make-up or rehearse.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere.

50|$|Polygamous marriages may {{be legally}} {{contracted}} in Algeria {{in the form}} of polygyny, and a man may take up to four wives.

50|$|Trinitrotriazine, or 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, is a {{theoretical}} explosive compound. Synthesis of this compound has been elusive despite its simple structure, as conventional nitration of triazine becomes <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> as more nitro groups are added. A successful route would more likely proceed by trimerisation of nitryl cyanide. The precursor, nitryl cyanide, was first synthesized by Rahm et al in 2014.|$|R
