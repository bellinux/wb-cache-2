The {{objective of this}} study was to determinate the increase of short (SCFA) and medium (MCFA) chain fatty acids in goat's and cow's milk during fermentation with ABT- 2 culture. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that higher contents of SCFA and MCFA are produced <b>in</b> goat's <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> comparison with cow's milk, during fermentation with ABT- 2 culture.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{addition}} to meeting nutritional requirements, breast milk plays {{important roles in}} biodefense for nursing in-fants. Dioxins have been detected at high concentrations <b>in</b> breast <b>milk,</b> raising concerns about disorders in nursing infants caused by breast <b>milk</b> containing dioxins <b>in</b> Japan. We analyzed dioxin levels <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> and maternal blood samples from 35 pregnant women in Japan. We also measured immunoglobulin (Ig) A concentrations <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> and investigated cor-relations with dioxin concentrations. In addition, 18 of the 35 women took Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Chlorella) supplements during pregnancy, and the effects on dioxin and IgA concentrations <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> were investigated. Toxic equivalents were significantly lower <b>in</b> the breast <b>milk</b> of women taking Chlorella tablets than in the Control group (P. 003). These results suggest that Chlorella supplementation by the mother may reduce transfer of dioxins to the child through breast milk. No sig-nificant correlation was identified between dioxin and IgA concentrations <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> the Control group. It is unlikely that normal levels of dioxin exposure via food have a remarkable influence on IgA <b>in</b> breast <b>milk.</b> IgA concentrations <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> the Chlorella group {{were significantly higher than}} in the Control group (P. 03). Increasing IgA levels <b>in</b> breast <b>milk</b> is considered to be effective for reducing the risk of infection in nursing infants. The present results suggest that Chlorella supplementation not only reduces dioxin levels <b>in</b> breast <b>milk,</b> but may also have beneficial effects on nursing infants by in-creasing IgA levels <b>in</b> breast <b>milk.</b> KEY WORDS: • Chlorella pyrenoidosa • co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls • maternal blood • polychlorinate...|$|R

According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk.

5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted <b>in</b> <b>milk,</b> and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars <b>in</b> <b>milk</b> are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal.

5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped <b>in</b> <b>milk</b> cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged <b>in</b> <b>milk</b> containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten.
