5|$|According to {{an article}} in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was {{produced}} in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release.

A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make its way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.|$|E

25|$|Lima's {{climate is}} largely {{reflective}} of the variant climate of Ohio. The region's climate {{can best be described}} as a humid continental climate, according to the Koppen Climate Maps. The city lies roughly halfway between Toledo and Dayton, Ohio and weather is at a similar medium. Summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cool to cold, with moderate precipitation year-round. Due to the city's inland location the moderating effects of Lake Erie are diminished, causing the city to experience higher averages in the summer and colder plunges in the winter than Toledo. On average the city sees around 4 more <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> annually than Dayton. During the summer months, Lima is prone to smog and allergens lingering when heat indexes exceed 85°F.|$|E
25|$|The March 1952 Southern United States tornado {{outbreak}} was {{the ninth}} deadliest tornado outbreak {{in the history}} of the United States. Affecting the American South, it produced 209 deaths, 50 of which were related to a single tornado in Arkansas. The outbreak produced 11 violent F4 tornadoes across the Southern United States, which is the fourth-largest number of F4–F5 events produced by a single outbreak. Only the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, the 1974 Super Outbreak, and the 2011 Super Outbreak surpassed this number. The severe weather event resulted in the fourth-largest number of tornado fatalities within a 24-hour period since 1950. The weather system associated with the outbreak also produced several <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> across the central and northern Great Plains and the upper Midwest. Blizzard conditions affected Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1951, Nashville {{experienced}} the most severe blizzard in the city's history. From Sunday, January 28 to Tuesday, January 30, an ice storm produced an inch of sleet and freezing rain, gridlocking the city and cutting off the power supply to many neighborhoods. On the afternoon of Wednesday, January 31, a blizzard swept through the city with wind gusts in excess of 50 mph and visibility down to zero. Eight <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> were recorded, and commute around the city was virtually impossible. On the night of February 2, low temperatures reached -13 degrees Fahrenheit, causing pipelines to burst. Many Nashville residents lacked both electricity and water. Due to {{the severity of the}} ice storm and the blizzard that followed afterwards, this is known as the worst episode of winter weather in Nashville's history. The blizzard of 1951 holds third place for the most snow recorded in Nashville from a single storm system, behind the blizzard of 1892 and Winter Storm Jonas in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate of}} Clinton County can be {{classified}} as humid continental.

25|$|Residents were {{suspicious}} of black fluid that flowed {{out of the}} Love Canal. For years, residents had complained about odors and substances on their yards or the public playgrounds. Finally the city acted and hired a consultant, Calspan Corporation, to do a massive study. In 1977, a harsh winter storm dumped 33-45 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> significantly raising the water table. The excess water got into the ground water and raised the elevation of the dioxins, which began erupting in residents' backyards. In the spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation launched an intensive air, soil, and groundwater sampling and analysis program following qualitative identification {{of a number of}} organic compounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal. It was also revealed that the standards at the time did not require the installation of a liner to prevent leaching; this became very common among companies.|$|E
25|$|However, {{early on}} February 16, heavy snow started falling {{in those two}} cities, and the snow later {{developed}} in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4inches (10cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15°F (-10°C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout {{the rest of the}} Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.|$|E
25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country {{race for}} a third time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham.

However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
