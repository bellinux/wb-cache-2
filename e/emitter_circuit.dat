40|$|This unique push-pull/parallel circuit {{produces}} a power output of four devices without the added loss {{and cost of}} power splitters and combiners. Motorola MRF 150 RF power FET {{makes it possible to}} parallel two or more devices at relatively high power levels. This technique is considered impractical for bipolar transistors due to their low input impedance. In a common-source amplifier configuration, a power FET has approximately five to ten times higher input impedance than a comparable bipolar transistor in a common <b>emitter</b> <b>circuit.</b> The output impedance in both cases is determined by the dc supply voltage and power level. The limit to the number of FETs that can be paralleled is dictated by physical, rather than electrical restrictions, where the mutual inductance between the drains is the most critical aspect, limiting the upper frequency range of operation. The magnitude of these losses is relative to the impedance levels involved, and becomes more serious at lower supply voltages and higher power levels. Since the minimum mounting distance of the transistors is limited by the package size, the only real improvement would be a multiple die package. For higher frequency circuits, these mutual inductances {{could be used as a}} part of the matching network, but it would seriously limit the bandwidth of the amplifier. This technique is popular with many VHF bipolar designs. In paralleling power FETs another important aspect must be considered: If the unity gain frequency (fα) of the device is sufficiently high, an oscillator will be created, where the paralleling inductances together with the gate and drain capacitances will form resonant circuits. The feedback is obtained through the drain to gate capacitance (Crss), which will result in 360 ° phase shift usually somewhere higher than the amplifier bandwidth. Thus, the oscillations may not be directly noticed in the amplifier output, but may have high amplitudes at the drains. This can be cured by isolating the paralleling inductance, which consists of the dc blocking capacitors (C 7 – C 10, Figure 2) and their wiring inductance from the gates. Low value noninductive resistors which do not appreciably affect the system gain can be used for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a frequency-variation based {{method has}} been {{proposed}} for transistor parameter estimation in a commonemitter transistor amplifier circuit. We design an algorithm to estimate the transistor parameters, based on noisy measurements of the output voltage when the input voltage is a sine wave of variable frequency and constant amplitude. The common <b>emitter</b> amplifier <b>circuit</b> has been modelled using the transistor Ebers-Moll equations and the perturbation technique {{has been used for}} separating the linear and nonlinear parts of the Ebers-Moll equations. This model of the amplifier has been used to determine the amplitude of the output sinusoid {{as a function of the}} frequency and the parameter vector. Then, applying the proposed method to the frequency components, the transistor parameters have been estimated. As compared to the conventional time-domain least squares method, the proposed method requires much less data storage and it results in more accurate parameter estimation, as it exploits the information in the time and frequency domain, simultaneously. The proposed method can be utilized for parameter estimation of an analog device in its operating range of frequencies, as it uses data collected from different frequencies output signals for parameter estimation.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{have been}} proposed for many electronic applications, such as field emitter, diode, transistors, integrated circuit interconnections and thermal interface material (TIM). The growth temperature of high quality CNT typically takes place at high temperatures. The high growth temperature causes significant difficulty in the integration of CNT to the many common material used in electronics, such as, metal, glasses and most polymers. We prepare the high-density aligned CNT film on the silicon/silicon dioxide substrate using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The aligned CNT film is kept intact after the supporting silicon dioxide layer is removed by hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. The "lifted off " CNT film can be transferred to various substrates at room temperature. This method avoids the problem caused by the high temperature process, and retains the CNT film quality. Thermal characterization indicates that {{the resistance of the}} transferred CNT film is comparable with that of as-grown CNT film.

Results are given {{as a function of}} solidification fraction on multi-crystalline production ingots, and link cell investigations to the solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) blends. Illuminated current-voltage characteristics of SoG-Si cells having a compensated, net acceptor concentration up to 3 x 1017 cm- 3 of show equivalent conversion efficiencies relative to control cells (η> 15. 3 %), and excellent open circuit voltage measurements (Voc> 625 mV). As net acceptor concentration is further increased, recombination influences minority carrier lifetime and offsets corresponding increases in open circuit voltage.

The Ag-SiO 2 nanocomposites are synthesised by Ag implantation into thermally oxidised SiO 2 layers on Si substrates and their fabrication processes are fully compatible with existing integrated circuit technology and their threshold fields are less than 20 V/mum. The local field enhancement mechanisms were studied and the fabrication processes of these layers optimised. Secondly, the electron field emission (FE) properties of two-dimensional quantum confinement structure were studied. Band gap modulated amorphous carbon (alpha-C) nanolayers were synthesised by pulsed laser deposition. In these structures, electrons are confined in a few nm thick low band gap sp 2 rich alpha-C layer, which is bound by the vacuum barrier and a 3 nm thick high band gap sp 3 rich alpha-C base layer. Anomalous FE properties, including negative differential conductance and repeatable switching effects, are observed when compared to control samples. These properties will be discussed in terms of resonant tunnelling and are of great interest in the high-speed vacuum microelectronic devices. Finally, due to the interesting electrical transport properties and rare FE characteristics of metal quantum dots (QDs), cobalt QDs were synthesized in a SiO 2 matrix by ion implantation. Staircase-like current-field characteristics were observed for the first time from these samples and give an experimental insight into existing Coulomb Blockade effects in the metal QDs during the FE process.
