The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> government. Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony {{in the style of}} a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.|$|E

5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party, he switched to the Labour Party {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became {{a target of}} Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E

5|$|John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, {{known as}} the Red Earl, {{inherited}} Althorp in 1857. He served as a Liberal Party politician and {{was a close friend}} of British prime minister William Gladstone, who he served under in all four of his cabinets. Although politically successful, John fell into hard times financially and was forced to eventually sell much of the enormous library collection in 1892 to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. After dying childless in 1910, John passed Althorp to his half brother, Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, who served as Lord Chamberlain from 1905 to 1912 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> administrations headed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith.|$|E
5|$|Rio Branco {{attended}} Brazil's Naval School {{and became}} a midshipman in 1841. Later that year he was enrolled in the Army's Military Academy, eventually becoming an instructor there. Rather than continue {{to serve in the}} military, he became a politician <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party. In 1845, he was elected a member of the provincial house of representatives of Rio de Janeiro province, site of the national capital of the same name. Rio Branco rose to power within the province under the tutelage of Aureliano Coutinho, Viscount of Sepetiba—a veteran politician who held tremendous influence over the young and inexperienced Emperor PedroII. He temporarily abandoned politics after Aureliano Coutinho's fall from grace and the subsequent dissolution of the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> arts tradition was lost.|$|E

5|$|The first Trades Union Congress {{was held}} in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade union {{membership}} in Northern England remained higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party have since struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party – although the Conservatives hold some rural seats, they have almost no urban seats and as of the 2016 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council, Newcastle City Council or Sheffield City Council. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrats benefitted from Conservative unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} the Liberal Party launched Women's Liberal Associations {{which allowed}} women {{more freedom to}} allocate a role and voice for themselves and were not a mere subsidiary of the national party. The organisation of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan, Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas. In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women's Liberal Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting in both English and Welsh. By 1893 there {{were said to be}} 7,000 members of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations which had raised to 9,000 by 1895. At a meeting of the North Wales Liberal Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women's Liberal Federation would merge with Cymru Fydd, a political pressure group for home rule, to form a new Welsh Liberal Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation. Despite some early successes Liberal organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes, many of the branches had closed by 1907.|$|E
