25|$|A {{new class}} of {{fluorescent}} protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or <b>far-red</b> fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties {{are similar to the}} organic dye Cy5.|$|E
2500|$|The most studied of the photoreceptors {{in plants}} is phytochrome. [...] It is {{sensitive}} to light in the red and <b>far-red</b> region of the visible spectrum. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based {{on the length of}} day and night (photoperiodism) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings.|$|E

50|$|Takuma Tanada {{observed}} that the root tips of barley adhered {{to the sides of}} a beaker with a negatively charged surface after being treated with red light, yet released after being exposed to <b>far-red</b> light. For mung bean it was the opposite, where <b>far-red</b> light exposure caused the root tips to adhere, and red light caused the roots to detach. This effect of red and <b>far-red</b> light on root tips is now known as the Tanada effect.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{plants are}} {{responsive}} to wavelengths {{of light in}} the blue, red and <b>far-red</b> regions of the spectrum through the action of several different photosensory systems. The photoreceptors for red and <b>far-red</b> wavelengths are known as phytochromes. There are at least 5 members of the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. There are several blue light photoreceptors known as cryptochromes. The combination of phytochromes and cryptochromes mediate growth and the flowering of plants in response to red light, <b>far-red</b> light, and blue light.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{adapted to}} shade {{have the ability}} to utilise <b>far-red</b> light (about 730 nm) more {{effectively}} than plants adapted to full sunlight. Most red light gets absorbed by the shade-intolerant canopy plants, but more of the <b>far-red</b> light penetrates the canopy, reaching the understory. The shade-tolerant plants found here are capable of photosynthesis using light at such wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{multicolor}} live-cell STED {{was performed}} using a pulsed <b>far-red</b> laser and CLIPf-tag and SNAPf-tag expression.|$|E
5000|$|Plants use {{phytochrome}} {{to detect}} and respond to red and <b>far-red</b> wavelengths. Phytochromes are signaling proteins that promote photomorphogenesis in response to red light and <b>far-red</b> light. [...] Phytochrome is the only known photoreceptor that absorbs light in the red/far red spectrum of light (600-750 nm) specifically and only for photosensory purposes. [...] Phytochromes are proteins with a light absorbing pigment attached called a chromophore. The chromophore is a linear tetrapyrrole called phytochromobilin.|$|E
50|$|Acaryochloris marina is a {{symbiotic}} {{species of the}} phylum Cyanobacteria that produces chlorophyll d, allowing it to use <b>far-red</b> light, at 710 nm wavelength.|$|E
50|$|Most {{organisms that}} utilize oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although {{at least three}} use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, <b>far-red</b> radiation.|$|E
50|$|Most {{organisms that}} utilize {{photosynthesis}} to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although {{at least three}} use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, <b>far-red</b> radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Phytochromes are characterised by a red/far-red photochromicity. Photochromic {{pigments}} {{change their}} [...] "colour" [...] (spectral absorbance properties) upon light absorption. In {{the case of}} phytochrome the ground state is Pr, the r indicating that it absorbs red light particularly strongly. The absorbance maximum is a sharp peak 650-670 nm, so concentrated phytochrome solutions look turquoise-blue to the human eye. But once a red photon has been absorbed, the pigment undergoes a rapid conformational change to form the Pfr state. Here fr indicates that now not red but <b>far-red</b> (also called [...] "near infra-red"; 705-740 nm) is preferentially absorbed. This shift in absorbance is apparent to the human eye as a slightly more greenish colour. When Pfr absorbs <b>far-red</b> light it is converted back to Pr. Hence, red light makes Pfr, <b>far-red</b> light makes Pr. In plants at least Pfr is the physiologically active or [...] "signalling" [...] state.|$|E
50|$|Phytochromes are red and <b>far-red</b> photoreceptors {{that help}} induce changes in {{certain aspects of}} plant development. Apart being itself the tropic factor (phototropism), light may also {{suppress}} the gravitropic reaction. In seedlings, red and <b>far-red</b> light both inhibit negative gravitropism in seedling hypocotyls (the shoot area below the cotyledons) causing growth in random directions. However, the hypocotyls readily orient towards blue light. This process is {{may be caused by}} phytochrome disrupting the formation of starch-filled endodermal amyloplasts and stimulating their conversion to other plastid types, such as chloroplasts or etiolaplasts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Far-red</b> {{light is}} {{light at the}} extreme red end of the visible spectrum, between red and infra-red light. Usually {{regarded}} as the region between 710 and 850 nm wavelength, it is dimly visible to some organisms' eyes. It is largely reflected or transmitted by plants because of the absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll, and it is perceived by the plant photoreceptor phytochrome. However, some organisms can {{use it as a}} source of energy in photosynthesis. [...] <b>Far-red</b> light also is used for vision by certain organisms such as some species of deep-sea fishes.|$|E
50|$|The {{seedlings}} sense {{light through}} the light receptors phytochrome (red and <b>far-red</b> light) and cryptochrome (blue light). Mutations in these photo receptors and their signal transduction components lead to seedling development that {{is at odds with}} light conditions, for example seedlings that show photomorphogenesis when grown in the dark.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two forms}} of phytochromes: red light absorbing, Pr, and <b>far-red</b> light absorbing, Pfr. Pfr, which is the active form of phytochromes, can be reverted to Pr, which is the {{inactive}} form, slowly by inducing darkness or more rapidly by irradiation by <b>far-red</b> light. The phytochrome apoprotein, a protein that together with a prosthetic group forms a particular biochemical molecule such as a hormone or enzyme, is synthesized in the Pr form. Upon binding the chromophore, the holoprotein, an apoprotein combined with its prosthetic group, becomes sensitive to light. If it absorbs red light it will change conformation to the biologically active Pfr form. The Pfr form can absorb far red light and switch back to the Pr form. The Pfr promotes and regulates photomorphogenesis in response to FR light, whereas Pr regulates de-etiolation in response to R light.|$|E
50|$|Most importantly, the {{reaction}} was light dependent. Exposure to red light would cause the tips to stick, while exposure to <b>far-red</b> {{would allow them to}} release. This simple experiment was indicative of phytochrome function, and the rapid nature of the response suggested that changes in bioelectric potential were seminal events in phytochrome signal propagation.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} {{regulated}} by the exposure of various photoreceptor pigments to light. Phytochrome A and phytochrome B both respond to an increasing proportion of red light to <b>far-red</b> light which occurs when the shoot comes out into the open. Cryptochrome 1 responds to increasing amounts of blue light when the shoot reaches the surface.|$|E
50|$|Folta {{believes}} this research {{would be of}} interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification, and he believes his research involving red and <b>far-red</b> light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.|$|E
50|$|Substituting the Draper point {{into this}} {{equation}} produces a frequency of 83 THz, or a wavelength of 3.6 µm, which is {{well into the}} infrared and completely invisible to the human eye. However, {{the leading edge of}} the blackbody radiation curve extends, at a small fraction of peak intensity, to the near-infrared and <b>far-red</b> (approximately the range 0.7-1 µm), which are weakly visible as a dull red.|$|E
50|$|The {{phytochrome}} pigment {{was discovered}} by Sterling Hendricks and Harry Borthwick at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland during a period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Using a spectrograph built from borrowed and war-surplus parts, they discovered that red light was very effective for promoting germination or triggering flowering responses. The red light responses were reversible by <b>far-red</b> light, indicating {{the presence of a}} photoreversible pigment.|$|E
50|$|All three common {{optical disc}} media (Compact disc, DVD, and Blu-ray) use light from laser diodes, for its {{spectral}} purity {{and ability to}} be focused precisely. DVD uses light of 650 nm wavelength (red), as opposed to 780 nm (<b>far-red,</b> commonly called infrared) for CD. This shorter wavelength allows a smaller pit on the media surface compared to CDs (0.74 µm for DVD versus 1.6 µm for CD), accounting in part for DVD's increased storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyll d {{is a form}} of chlorophyll, {{identified}} by Harold Strain and Winston Manning in 1943. It is present in marine red algae and cyanobacteria which use energy captured from sunlight for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll d absorbs <b>far-red</b> light, at 710 nm wavelength, just outside the optical range. An organism that contains chlorophyll d is adapted to an environment such as moderately deep water, where it can use far red light for photosynthesis, although there is not a lot of visible light.|$|E
50|$|After World War II ended, Tanada {{became an}} {{administrator}} to import and manufacture fertilizer. Tanada {{was assigned to}} the United States Department of Agriculture, where he published works related to the effects of red and <b>far-red</b> light on plant roots. The photomorphogenic processes he discovered in relation to light spectrum on plant root adhesion became known as the Tanada effect. He later discovered that the electric charge causing roots to stick to glass is generated by the trace element boron.|$|E
50|$|Water is {{relatively}} transparent to visible light, near ultraviolet light, and <b>far-red</b> light, but it absorbs most ultraviolet light, infrared light, and microwaves. Most photoreceptors and photosynthetic pigments utilize {{the portion of}} the light spectrum that is transmitted well through water. Microwave ovens take advantage of water's opacity to microwave radiation to heat the water inside of foods. The very weak onset of absorption in the red end of the visible spectrum lends water its intrinsic blue hue (see Color of water).|$|E
50|$|The most studied of the photoreceptors {{in plants}} is phytochrome. It is {{sensitive}} to light in the red and <b>far-red</b> region of the visible spectrum. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based {{on the length of}} day and night (photoperiodism) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings.|$|E
5000|$|Phytochrome {{comes in}} two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) {{converts}} phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers {{the plant to}} grow. In turn, <b>far-red</b> light {{is present in the}} shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day. [...] Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr. This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to <b>far-red</b> ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering. Other experiments have proven this by exposing plants to extra red-light {{in the middle of the}} night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.|$|E
50|$|Small ultra red {{fluorescent}} protein (smURFP) is a {{class of}} <b>far-red</b> fluorescent protein evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin. Native α-allophycocyanin requires an exogenous protein, known as a lyase, to attach the chromophore, phycocyanobilin. Phycocyanobilin is not present in mammalian cells. smURFP was evolved to covalently attach phycocyanobilin without a lyase and fluoresce, covalently attach biliverdin (ubiquitous to mammalian cells) and fluoresce, blue-shift fluorescence to match the organic fluorophore, Cy5, and not inhibit E. coli growth. smURFP was found after 12 rounds of random mutagenesis and manually screening 10,000,000 bacterial colonies.|$|E
50|$|LED grow lights vary {{in color}} {{depending}} on the intended use. It is known {{from the study of}} photomorphogenesis that green, red, <b>far-red</b> and blue light spectra have an effect on root formation, plant growth, and flowering, but there are not enough scientific studies or field-tested trials using LED grow lights to recommended specific color ratios for optimal plant growth under LED grow lights. It has been shown that many plants will grow normally if given both red and blue light. However, many studies indicate that red and blue light only provides the most cost efficient method of growth, plant growth is still better under light supplemented with green.|$|E
50|$|The strongest {{lines are}} at 337.1 nm {{wavelength}} in the ultraviolet. Other {{lines have been}} reported at 357.6 nm, also ultraviolet. This information refers to the second positive system of molecular nitrogen, which {{is by far the}} most common. No vibration of the two nitrogen atoms is involved, because the atom-atom distance does not change with the electronic transition. The rotation needs to change to deliver the angular momentum of the photon, furthermore multiple rotational states are populated at room temperature. There are also lines in the <b>far-red</b> and infrared from the first positive system, and a visible blue laser line from the molecular nitrogen positive (1+) ion.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{plants have}} {{multiple}} phytochromes encoded by different genes. The {{different forms of}} phytochrome control different responses {{but there is also}} redundancy so that in the absence of one phytochrome, another may take on the missing functions. There are five genes that encode phytochromes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genetic model, PHYA-PHYE. [...] PHYA is involved in the regulation of photomorphogenesis in response to <b>far-red</b> light. [...] PHYB is involved in regulating photoreversible seed germination in response to red light. PHYC mediates the response between PHYA and PHYB. PHYD and PHYE mediate elongation of the internode and control the time in which the plant flowers.|$|E

50|$|Around 1989, several {{laboratories}} {{were successful}} in producing transgenic plants which produced elevated amounts of different phytochromes (overexpression). In all cases the resulting plants had conspicuously short stems and dark green leaves. Harry Smith and co-workers at Leicester University in England showed that by increasing the expression level of phytochrome A (which responds to <b>far-red</b> light), shade avoidance responses can be altered. As a result, plants can expend less energy on growing as tall as possible and have more resources for growing seeds and expanding their root systems. This could have many practical benefits: for example, grass blades that would grow more slowly than regular grass would not require mowing as frequently, or crop plants might transfer more energy to the grain instead of growing taller.|$|E

50|$|A {{prominent}} {{hypothesis is}} that canopy shyness {{has to do with}} mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species. Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants are able to sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered <b>far-red</b> (FR) light, a task largely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome photoreceptors. Many species of plant respond to an increase in FR light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the FR stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation. Similarly, blue (B) light is used by plants to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants, though this modality is just beginning to be characterized.|$|E
