5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the <b>donor</b> <b>animal,</b> when detected by the vomeronasal organ of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located {{adjacent to each other}} on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans.

500|$|Consistent with {{a role in}} male-male aggression, {{adult male}} mice secrete {{significantly}} more Mups into their urine than females, juveniles or castrated male mice. The precise mechanism driving this difference between the sexes is complex, but at least three hormones—testosterone, growth hormone and thyroxine—are known to positively influence the production of Mups in mice. Wild house mouse urine contains variable combinations of four to seven distinct Mup proteins per mouse. Some inbred laboratory mouse strains, such as BALB/c and C57BL/6, also have different proteins expressed in their urine. However, unlike wild mice, different individuals from the same strain express the same protein pattern, an artifact of many generations of inbreeding. One unusual Mup is less variable than the others: it is consistently produced by {{a high proportion of}} wild male mice and is almost never found in female urine. When this Mup was made in bacteria and used in behavioural testing, it was found to attract female mice. Other Mups were tested but they did not have the same attractive qualities, suggesting the male-specific Mup acts as a sex pheromone. Scientists named this Mup darcin as a humorous reference to Fitzwilliam Darcy, the romantic hero from Pride and Prejudice. Taken together, the complex patterns of Mups produced has the potential to provide a range information about the <b>donor</b> <b>animal,</b> such as gender, fertility, social dominance, age, genetic diversity or kinship. Wild mice (unlike laboratory mice that are genetically identical and which therefore also have identical patterns of Mups in the urine) have individual patterns of Mup expression in their urine that act as a [...] "barcode" [...] to uniquely identify the owner of a scent mark.|$|E

For this, 20 clinically healthy adult goats were divided into two groups of ten animals each: control group (not-treated whole blood <b>donor</b> <b>animals),</b> and experimental group (<b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> which were treated with plasmapheresis). Goats were selected and evaluated through physical examination (vital functions) and complementary tests (complete blood counts, total proteins, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and plasma free haemoglobin) were carried out at the following moments: immediately before and after blood donation, 12, 24, 72, 120, 240, 360, 480, and 720 hours after the procedures. Results were analysed comparing animals in and between both groups (at differents moments of the study). The clinical observations made during the period of 30 days after donation of 20 % of total blood volume, with or without plasmapheresis in the animals of studied groups, were not influenced by these procedures. The results revealed significant variation of eritrogram components, showing the experimental group to have better recovery rates according to time.

40|$|In {{incubated}} colonocytes {{isolated from}} rat colons, {{the rates of}} utilization O 2, glucose or glutamine were linear with respect to time for over 30 min, and the concentrations of adenine nucleotides plus the ATP/ADP or ATP/AMP concentration ratios remained approximately constant for 30 min. Glutamine, n-butyrate or ketone bodies were the only substrates that caused increases in O 2 consumption by isolated incubated colonocytes. The maximum activity of hexokinase in colonic mucosa {{is similar to that}} of 6 -phosphofructokinase. Starvation of the <b>donor</b> <b>animal</b> decreased the activities of hexokinase and 6 -phosphofructokinase, whereas it increased those of glucose- 6 -phosphatase and fructose-bisphosphatase. Isolated incubated colonocytes utilized glucose at about 6. 8 mumol/min per g dry wt., with lactate accounting for 83 % of glucose removed. These rates were not affected by the addition of glutamine, acetoacetate or n-butyrate, and starvation of the <b>donor</b> <b>animal.</b> Isolated incubated colonocytes utilized glutamine at about 5. 5 mumol/min per g dry wt., which is about 21 % of the maximum activity of glutaminase. The major end-products of glutamine metabolism were glutamate, aspartate, alanine and ammonia. Starvation of the <b>donor</b> <b>animal</b> decreased the rate of glutamine utilization by colonocytes, which is accompanied by a decrease in glutamate formation and in the maximum activity of glutaminase.

40|$|Xenotransplantation using pig cells, {{tissues and}} organs may be {{associated}} with the transfer of porcine infectious agents, which may infect the human recipient and in the worst case induce a disease (zoonosis). To prevent this, a broad screening program of the <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> for putative zoonotic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and others, using sensitive and specific detection methods has to be performed. As long as it is still unknown, which microorganism represents a real risk for the recipient, experience from allotransplantation should be brought in. Due to the fact that pigs can be screened long before the date of transplantation, xenotransplantation will become eventually safer compared with allotransplantation. Screening and selection of animals free of potential zoonotic microorganisms, Caesarean section, vaccination and/or treatment with chemotherapeutics are the strategies of choice to obtain <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> not transmitting microorganisms.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As {{clinical}} trials are in progress involving porcine islet cell transplantation, microbial safety remains a key issue. Therefore, {{in the context}} of pig-to-human xenotransplantation, we provide an overview of the recent progress in the studies of relevant viruses including well known problematic viruses, such as herpesviruses and porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) in addition to some emerging issues regarding other pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: The ability of herpesvirus to infect across species barriers is probably underestimated and requires monitoring and control of both xenograft donors and recipients for latent infection. Exclusion from donors and recipient monitoring for other exogenous pathogens including newly identified Parvovirus- 4 are warranted. The availability of the swine whole genome sequence may help to characterize and select <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> with less PERV infectivity.

40|$|As pigs {{compete with}} humans for high quality feed {{ingredients}} such as grains, alternative feed sources {{need to be}} found. These alternative feed ingredients are usually high in indigestible carbohydrates, consisting mainly of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and are less suitable for human consumption. In order {{to find the most}} suitable feed ingredients for pig nutrition, they need to be well characterized regarding their nutritional value. This is possible with in vitro methods which mimic the hindgut degradation of these mainly indigestible feed ingredients. These in vitro methods either use enzymes or faecal inocula to incubate the feed ingredient to be tested. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on some general aspects of in vitro methods with pigs, such as the number of animals to use for inocula preparation, influence of enzymatic pre-digestion of feed ingredients, repeatability of fermentation results, adaptation time of <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> etc. The studies described in this thesis describe a number of experiments which were designed to test some of these above mentioned aspects in order to improve the in vitro procedure and therefore the predictability of feeding values of new feed ingredients (in the following called substrates). The first study compared two in vitro methods; one using enzymes and using inocula for fermentation and a combination of the two. The results showed a similar ranking order. Nonetheless, a combination of enzymatic pre-digestion with subsequent fermentation seems most suitable to best predict the nutrient availability of the tested substrate. The second study determined if 19 days of adaptation of <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> is adequate to adapt them to a new diet, either high or low in NSP. The adaptation to the new diet was not completed and had the biggest influence on the slow fermentable substrate cellulose. The third study revealed that the results of a single fermentation run can be representative for the fermentation capacity of the <b>donor</b> <b>animals.</b> However, the optimal number of <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> remains to be determined in order to receive results with a low variation coefficient. The last study compared the fermentation capacity of pigs raised on different organic farms. The results showed that animals across organic farms had a relatively similar and high fermentation capacity despite the different rations fed on single farms and varying farm management. This might be caused by the animals’ lifelong exposure to a high variety of fibre. The results of this thesis show that in vitro fermentation methods can be further improved and need further attention regarding the optimal number of <b>donor</b> <b>animals</b> and their nutrition. It would be of special interest to compare the differences of fermentation capacity and energy yield between animals that are fed diets either high or low in NSP. Pig diets based on an improved in vitro methodology have the potential to increase economic profit for feed industry and farmers, but also to increase animal health and welfare.  ...|$|R
