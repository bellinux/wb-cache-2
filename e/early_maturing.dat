25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. <b>Early</b> <b>maturing</b> boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that <b>early</b> <b>maturing</b> boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Cells of Paramecium in {{the sexually}} {{immature}} {{period of the}} clonal life cycle contain a protein called immaturin, which represses mating activity when injected into sexually mature cells. The amount of immaturin at various stages of the immaturity period was examined by injecting cytoplasm from immature cells of one wild-type and two <b>early</b> <b>mature</b> mutant clones into mature cells of wild-type. The proportion of immature cells {{brought about by the}} injection increased until about 10 - 15 fissions after conjugation of the donor cells in all three clones. But the percentage of immature cells induced by the injection decreased rapidly from the 25 th to the 30 th fission of both <b>early</b> <b>mature</b> donors, while the percentage was still high with a wild-type donor of the same fission age. When cytoplasm of the Emt A (<b>early</b> <b>mature</b> mutant) homozygote taken immediately before maturation (about 27 fissions) was injected into the wild-type immature cells of 45 fissions after conjugation, 13 % of the recipient cells expressed mating reactivity. But when cytoplasm of Emt A cells 20 and 50 fissions after conjugation was injected into the same cells, no reactive cell appeared. The results suggest that cytoplasm of the <b>early</b> <b>mature</b> mutant immediately before maturation contains some material that accelerates maturation when injected into wild-type cells in the late stage of immaturity. On the other hand, the immature cytoplasm of wild-type cells about 25 fissions after conjugation showed no effect when injected into <b>early</b> <b>mature</b> cells immediately before maturation. The function of the <b>early</b> <b>mature</b> gene product was suggested to be the destruction of immaturin activity...|$|R

25|$|Nebbiolo {{does not}} adapt {{particularly}} well to various vineyard soil types, preferring soils with {{high concentration of}} calcareous marl such as those found on the right bank of the Tanaro river around Alba where Barolo and Barbaresco are produced. The grape can thrive in sandy soils, such as those on the left bank of the Tanaro around the Roero district but the wines from this soil type tend not to be as perfumed - lacking in particular the classic tar aromas. The slightly acidic pH of the sandy Roero soils tend to produce <b>early</b> <b>maturing</b> wines. The lighter wines of Ghemme and Gattinara come from the acidic porphyry soils of the hills between Novara and Vercelli. In the lower Aosta Valley, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} granite while the soils of the Valtellina region of Lombardy are predominantly schist based. In addition to soil type, the drainage ability and concentration of magnesium and potassium can have an influencing effect on the type of Nebbiolo wine is produced.|$|E

2500|$|For girls, early {{maturation}} {{can sometimes}} {{lead to increased}} self-consciousness, though a typical aspect in maturing females.

Nearly half of all American high school girls' diets are to lose weight. In addition, girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature.

40|$|Purpose: To {{confirm the}} effect of maturational {{differences}} on anthropometric and physical testing and explore {{the effect of}} maturation on technical skill and coaches’ perceptions of skill in adolescent Australian footballers. Methods: Athletes were recruited from a semi-elite under 16 competition (n = 94, age 15. 7 ± 0. 3 years) and completed anthropometric, physical, and technical skill tests. Coaches from each team provided subjective ratings of athletes’ technical skills. Maturation groups were derived from years from peak height velocity estimates, with classifications either later, average or <b>earlier</b> <b>maturing.</b> Results: Effect size comparisons revealed very large to moderate effects between groups for anthropometric measures and performance in sprint and jump tasks. Small to moderate effects were reported between groups for coaches’ perceptions of skill, with the <b>earlier</b> <b>maturing</b> group perceived to have better overall technical skills, marking and ball winning abilities. Small to trivial effects were reported for performance in the technical skill tests. Conclusions: Despite no differences in skill tests, <b>earlier</b> <b>maturing</b> athletes may be afforded significant selection and competition advantages due to advanced physical capacities and coaches’ perceptions of skill...|$|R

6000|$|To {{return to}} the subject of voice. The tree-creepers do not possess melodious, or at any rate mellow notes, {{although}} in so numerous a family there is great variety of tone, ranging from a small reedy voice like the faint stridulation of a grasshopper, to the resounding, laughter-like, screaming concerts of Homorus, which may be heard distinctly two miles away. As a rule, the notes are loud ringing calls; and in many species the cry, rapidly reiterated, resembles a peal of laughter. With scarcely an exception, they possess no set song; but in most species that live always in pairs there are loud, vehement, gratulatory notes uttered by the two birds in concert when they meet after a brief separation. This habit they possess in common with birds of other families, as, for instance, the tyrants; but, in some creepers, out of this confused outburst of joyous sound has been developed a. musical performance very curious, and perhaps unique among birds. On meeting, the male and female, standing close together and facing each other, utter their clear ringing concert, one emitting loud single measured notes, while the notes of its fellow are rapid, rhythmical triplets; their voices have a joyous character, and seem to accord, thus producing a kind of harmony. This manner of singing is perhaps most perfect in the oven-bird, Furnarias, and it is very curious that the young birds, when only partially fledged, are constantly heard in the nest or oven apparently practising these duets in the intervals when the parents are absent; single measured notes, triplets, and long concluding trills are all repeated with wonderful fidelity, although these notes are in character utterly unlike the hunger cry, which is like that of other fledglings. I cannot help thinking that this fact of the young birds beginning to sing like the adults, while still confined in their dark cradle, is one of very considerable significance, especially when we consider the singular character of the performance; and that it might even be found to throw some light on the obscure question of the comparative antiquity of the different and widely separated Dendrocolaptine groups. It is a doctrine in evolutionary science that the <b>early</b> <b>maturing</b> of instincts in the young indicates a high antiquity for the species or group; {{and there is no reason}} why this principle should not be extended, in the case of birds at any rate, to language. It is true that Daines Barrington's notion that young song-birds learn to sing only by imitating the adults still holds its ground; and Darwin gives it his approval in his Descent of Man. It is perhaps one of those doctrines which are partially true, or which do not contain the whole truth; and it is possible to believe that, while many singing birds do so learn their songs, or acquire a greater proficiency in them from hearing the adults, in other species the song comes instinctively, and is, like other instincts and habits, purely an [...] "inherited memory." ...|$|E
