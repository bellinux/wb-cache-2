5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique. She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> that October.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Morath {{continued}} to pursue both assignments and independent projects. The film Copyright by Inge Morath {{was made by}} German filmmaker Sabine Eckhard in 1992, {{and was one of}} several films selected for a presentation of Magnum Films at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2007. Eckhard filmed Morath at home and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio,</b> and in New York and Paris with her colleagues, including Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt and others. In 2002, working with film director Regina Strassegger, Morath fulfilled a long-held wish to revisit the lands of her ancestors, along the borderlands of Styria and Slovenia. This mountainous region, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had become the faultline between two conflicting ideologies after World War II and until 1991, when attempts at rapprochement led to conflict {{on both sides of the}} border. The book Last Journey (2002), and Strasseger's film Grenz Räume (Border Space, 2002), document Morath's visits to her homeland during the final years of her life.|$|E

25|$|After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a {{small island}} off the coast of Brittany, 10 miles south of the Quiberon peninsula. She {{purchased}} a ruined 17th-century fortress, located {{at the end of the}} island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio.</b> When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.|$|E
500|$|Clothing {{played an}} {{important}} factor in Monroe's star image. She often wore white to emphasize her blondness, and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure. Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing that exposed large amounts of her body or even a wardrobe malfunction, such as when one of the shoulder straps of her dress suddenly snapped during a press conference. In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the American Dream, a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom. [...] <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> biographies, stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated.|$|E
500|$|Frederikke Federspiel (1839–1913) {{was one of}} {{the very}} first female photographers in Denmark. At the age of 35, she {{received}} training in photography from her family in Hamburg, Germany, where her uncle, Poul Friedrich Lewitz, her aunt and cousins were all photographers. In 1876, when registering her business in Aalborg, she {{became one of the first}} officially recognized female photographers in Denmark when she gave her profession as [...] "Photographin", a German word which clearly shows that she was a woman. Specializing in portraits, she also became one of the earliest female members of the Dansk Fotografisk Forening in 1883. One of the first to experiment with magnesium powder for flash, she installed electric lamps <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> when electricity came to Aalborg in 1901.|$|E

500|$|New Seasons {{met with}} WNA {{and offered to}} {{reproduce}} the painting, either {{on the east side}} of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store. Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [...] that works like an arc welder.|$|E

2500|$|Gertrude Käsebier {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} American photographers of the early 20th century and best known for her evocative images of Native Americans.

[...] Her memories of affection and respect for the Lakota people inspired her to send a letter to Buffalo Bill requesting permission to photograph Sioux traveling with the show <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio.</b> Buffalo Bill and Käsebier were similar in their abiding Native American culture and maintained friendships with the Sioux. Buffalo Bill quickly approved Käsebier's request and she began her project on Sunday morning, April 14, 1898.

In 1987 during the {{restoration}} of the Abbey of La Lucerne, in Normandy, the lower part of a man's arm was discovered in a reliquary, the relic was thought to be Richard's. After examination, to establish its provenance, the relic was offered to Bishop Eric Kemp and received into the cathedral on 15 June 1990. The relic was buried in 1991 below the St Richard altar. A further relic, together with an authentication certificate, was offered from Rome {{at the same time and}} is now housed at the bishops chapel in Chichester. The modern shrine of Richard contains an altar that was designed by Robert Potter, a tapestry designed by Ursula Benker-Schirmer (partly woven <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio</b> in Bavaria and partly at the West Dean College) and an icon designed by Sergei Fyodorov that shows St Richard in episcopal vestments, his hand raised in blessing towards the viewer, but also in supplication to the figure of Christ who appears to him from heaven [...]|$|E
2500|$|Gertrude Käsebier {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} American photographers of the early 20th century. Käsebier was known for her evocative images of motherhood, her powerful portraits of Native Americans and her promotion of photography as a career for women. In 1898, Käsebier watched Buffalo Bill’s Wild West troupe parade past her Fifth Avenue studio in New York City, toward Madison Square Garden. Her memories of affection and respect for the Lakota people inspired her to send a letter to William [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] Cody requesting permission to photograph Sioux traveling with the show <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>studio.</b> Cody and Käsebier were similar in their abiding respect for Native American culture and maintained friendships with the Sioux. Cody quickly approved Käsebier’s request and she began her project on Sunday morning, April 14, 1898. Käsebier’s project was purely artistic and her images were not made for commercial purposes and never used in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West program booklets or promotional posters. Käsebier took classic photographs of the Sioux while they were relaxed. Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk were among Käsebier’s most challenging and revealing portraits. Käsebier's photographs are preserved at the National Museum of American History's Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
