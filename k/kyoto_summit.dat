Under Simeón's presidency, this event marked a {{significant}} change in those forums, with a shift of approach in the way the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) dealt with environmental problems in the region. Simeón attended the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Summit</b> in 1997, to participate in the discussion of the Protocol that bears that city’s name, a Protocol which was developed for the purpose of implementing the United Nations framework convention on climate change.|$|E
50|$|Marshall's {{category}} of 'conservation ethics' {{is an extension}} of use-value into the non-human biological world. It focuses only on the worth of the environment in terms of its utility or usefulness to humans. It contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology', hence {{is often referred to as}} 'shallow ecology', and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value - instrumental to the welfare of human beings. Conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations. It could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by Governments at the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>summit</b> in 1997 and three agreements reached in Rio in 1992.|$|E

They realize that all Snatchers have a connection to Russia and their presence is linked {{with the appearance of}} the mysterious SNOW 9 pollen. They find a correspondence between the Moscow River and the local Ina River and locate the Snatchers' [...] "Kremlin" [...] beneath a church resembling Saint Basil's Cathedral, which is also very close to the abandoned subway lines. Before leaving for there, Gillian sends Mika to the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Summit,</b> where the Chief was going to attend (and the Snatcher-Chief was going to attack the leaders). Before he leaves, Mika asks Gillian for a dinner date, which he promises to her should they make it out alive. In the temple, Gillian finds stacked Snatcher skeletons as well as a skin culturing room. After sending Metal outside to call for reinforcements, and being assaulted by Insectors and Snatchers, Gillian discovers Jamie is safe, but the two are suddenly confronted by Elijah Modnar.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the present state of applied modelling in the area of international trade in agriculture and related resource and environmental modelling. This review has a deliberate bias on current European policy issues. The outcomes of negotiation rounds such as World Trade Organization trade negotiations and the <b>Kyoto</b> environmental <b>summit,</b> and the prospect of EU enlargement bear implications for European farmers, related supplying and processing industries and European consumers. The assessment of likely policy impact is bound to be complex and should be supported by quantitative modelling analyses that explain the trade relations of European countries with third countries. We provide in this paper a comparative assessment of alternative modelling approaches. This includes theoretical modelling foundations, datasets employed and institutional aspects, such as model maintenance and dissemination of results. A typology of models is provided by structuring the assessment along a clear set of evaluation criteria...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study China's {{position}} regarding the global climate and the numerous topics discussed in the global meetings held during 1997, ending in the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>summit</b> in the same year. Chinas position during this year was evidently {{on the side of}} developing countries. China regarded topics such as technology transfer, emission trading and Commitments for the participating parties as very important topics which had to be considered. Chinas final position regarding these subjects was during 1997 : - Increased funding and technology transfer resources to developing countries. - Objection to the inclusion of emission trading in the protocol. - No new commitments of any nature for developing countries. - National development is Chinas key issue...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{advanced}} new sensor, the Greenhouse Gas Monitor (GGMTM), which will revolutionize the global measurement {{of greenhouse gas}} levels. The GGMTM is an ideal compact, passive instrument for deployment on future-generation small LEO satellites. The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>summit</b> on greenhouse gas and carbon emissions has demonstrated {{the urgent need for}} accurate, global monitoring of a range of greenhouse gases. Levels are currently estimated by making precise ground-based measurements at a few points around the world; coverage of the Earth’s surface can be vastly improved by making measurements from space along a closely spaced grid. We are developing an advanced tuneable etalon spectrometer, tuned to the near infrared bands (1. 2 to 1. 7 mm), which will scan the reflected sun-glint on the Earth’s surface and measure CO 2 absorption spectra and atmospheric column amounts. In addition to the primary Greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, the GGMTM can also measure the column amounts of methane (CH 4), water vapour and oxygen. The instrument will scan a swath width of 400 km with a grid spacing of 50 km and provide about 1000 samples per month on a 8 ° x 10 ° grid. The target standard error in monthly averages is about 0. 3 % corresponding to about 1 ppm CO 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{renewable}} energy sources {{has led to an}} increasing interest in the use of wind farms. With such an abundance of open space and wind, Australia seems an ideal place for the farms to boom. Whilst the proposed wind farms have the support of a majority of Australians, the developments must also protect native vegetation, endangered bird life and consider aesthetic issues. Brownouts are expected across Australia within four years. This coupled with the targets set by state and federal governments {{for renewable energy}} – post <b>Kyoto</b> Climate <b>Summit</b> - are expected to intensify the use of wind farms. The criterion set out in this paper is intended to establish a socially acceptable approach to the siting of wind farms in Australia. It is acknowledged that each proposed wind farm must be assessed on its individual merits. However, users would benefit from a series of guidelines as well as government policy and procedures, and public consultation. This paper offers a technical and social perspective for the siting of wind farms. The technical perspective encompasses issues such as blade glint, shadow flicker and noise. It is intended that this work will facilitate the growth of the Australian wind energy industry in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner...|$|R
40|$|No {{doubt that}} the issue of Global climate change has been one ofthe {{greatest}} environmental problems whose effects cannot be denied in diverse countries and the world at large. The avert effect from this issue has led tq several local, regional and international conferences which have culminated in several protocols, and international legal frameworks formulated (Ranging from The Rio Earth <b>Summit,</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol, and Copenhagen Conference among others) to tackle this issue. Yet Global climate change remains a global concern and a major threat to human security. The study examines the responses to Global Climate Change and the factors limiting the effectiveness and efficiency of the response. This paper adopted the descriptive historical approach and relied solely on secondary sources for data collection. This paper found among others that there are gaps between policy formulation and policy implementation, the major debacle to the effectiveness of the policies is the proliferation of Multilateral Environment Agreement (MEA), overlapping interest between market and nature and lack of gender sensitivity of the responses. Based on the findings, we recommend the need for the feminization of climate change response and more effort towards implementatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{question has}} to do with reaching a new level of globalization, of world awareness and conscience, where there is a universal understanding {{of the importance of the}} earth as a whole, the welfare of nature and of humankind, the interdependence of all, and the apocalyptic catastrophe menacing creation " (Boff, 1995 : 7) Global concern over the state of the natural environment has been increasing enormously in recent years. This concern has materialized within global, national and local policy circles with an array of citizen participation in environmental conservation and efforts at the national and local levels as well as international initiatives such as the 1992 Earth Summit, 1994 Rio summit, 1997 <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Summit,</b> and more recently the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development; all aiming at dealing with the environmental "crisis " with poverty deepening and environmental degradation worsening. In much of these initiatives, several conclusions have been reached as to the effect and the magnitude of the crisis and the solutions that can be adopted in order to alleviate the global situation. The 1992 Rio summit on global warming recognized a correlation between industrial development and the increase of radioactive gases in the atmosphere and suggested that development in terms of industrial machinery is one of the major causes of the environmental crisis (Aadrwal and Narain...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of renewable energy}} resources are growing because of many reasons including the increasing costs of fossil fuels and the growing awareness of sustainability and environmental concerns. There are many different possibilities to use renewable energy systems in the domestic housing sector like photovoltaic for electrical power or solar collectors for thermal energy to provide space heating and hot water. Moreover there are more heat pump systems on the market using a borehole to upgrade the thermal energy and use it efficiently in heating systems. It is clear that individual house owners should install renewable energy systems such as solar-assisted heat pumps {{if they are to}} assist in contributing to reducing primary fossil fuels and CO 2 emissions as agreed at the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>summit.</b> Significant research has been carried out in the field of solar-assisted heat pump system since the 70 s but most of the technologies developed have stayed at the research level due to two primary reasons, namely poor control strategies and the inability to keep operating temperatures high enough to realize high coefficients of performance over the full year. Within the frame of the EC funded Endohousing project these issues are being investigated. The research focuses on the development of an in innovate technology that comprising integrating large unglazed solar roof collectors coupled to a heat pump whose operation is controlled via hi-tech control strategies to manage the movement of thermal energy effectively in different sections of the system. The project has set up five demonstration systems using the endothermic technology. This paper is concerned with the setting up, commissioning and run in of the various systems and an initial evaluation of the results that have been obtained to date for space heating, cooling and seasonal storage...|$|E
40|$|The European Union has {{an ongoing}} {{commitment}} to reducing CO 2 emission as highlighted by its agreement at the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Summit.</b> One approach to achieving these reductions {{would be to}} develop alternative energy sources for major energy demanding sectors. In the EU, about 40 % of all energy consumed is associated with buildings and of this, about 60 % is utilised in the housing sector. A {{major part of the}} energy demand of buildings could be met by utilising renewable energy sources, e. g. solar energy. Existing large-scale plants for power generation prevent efficient utilisation of the waste hot water produced. This means that to meet electricity demand, vast quantities of fossil fuels are burnt releasing unwanted pollutants (e. g., CO 2 and NOx) into the atmosphere. Over the last decade, small-scale CHP plants have been introduced for many applications with proven environmental and economic benefits. In addition, solar energy has been used to generate electricity and provide hot water in conjunction with the CHP plants. Investigation of a hybrid heat pipe solar collector/CHP system was carried out in this research. The system is powered by solar and gas energy as well as the boiler waste heat to provide electricity and heating for residential buildings. Compared to the relevant system configurations, this system has the following innovative features: The solar collector was integrated with exhaust flue gas channels that allowed both solar energy and waste heat from exhaust gas to be utilised. Heat pipes as high efficiency heat transfer devices were incorporated in the collector panel. Both miniature and normal heat pipes were investigated, and this resulted in two types of collectors, e. g., thin membrane heat pipe solar collector, and hybrid heat pipe solar collector, to be produced for this application. A compact, lightweight turbine was applied in this system. Novel refrigerants, including n-pentane and hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), were employed as the working fluids for the CHP system. Use of the system would save primary energy of approximately 3, 150 kWh per year compared to the conventional electricity and heating supply systems, and this would result in reduction of CO 2 emission of up to 1. 5 tonnes. The running cost of the proposed system would also be lower. The research initially investigated the thermal performance of several heat pipes, including micro/miniature heat pipes, normal circular and rectangular heat pipes, with/without wicks. An analytical model was developed to evaluate the heat transport capacity for these heat pipes. A miniature heat pipe with parallel piped channel geometry was proposed. The variation of heat transport capacity for either micro/miniature or normal heat pipes with operation temperature, liquid fill level, inclination and channel geometry were investigated. Investigation of the operating characteristics of the selected heat pipes, e. g., two miniature and one mini heat pipes, and two normal heat pipes, was then carried out using both the numerical technique and experimental testing. It was found that the results from tests were in good agreement with the numerical predictions when the test conditions were close to the simulation assumptions. The research work further involved the design, modelling, construction and tests of two innovative heat pipe solar collectors, namely, the thin membrane heat pipe solar collector and the hybrid heat pipe solar collector. A computer model was developed to analyse the heat transfer in the collectors. Two collector efficiencies, η and η 1, were defined to evaluate their thermal performance, which were all indicated as the function of a general parameter (tmean-ta) /In. Effects of the top cover, manifold as well as flue gas temperature and flow rate (for hybrid collector only) on collector efficiencies were investigated using the computer model developed. Laboratory tests were carried out to validate the modelling predictions and experimentally examine the thermal performance of the collectors. Comparison was made between the modelling and testing results, and the reasons for error formation were analysed. The research then considered the issues of the micro impulse-reaction turbine, which was another part of the integrated system. The structure configuration, coupling pattern with the generator as well as internal geometry contour of the turbine were described. The velocity, pressure and turbulent kinetic energy of the flow in the turbine were determined using numerical CFD prediction. In addition, experimental tests were carried out using a prototype system. The results of CFD simulation and testing show good agreement. This indicates that CFD {{can be used as a}} tool of optimizing turbine geometry and determining operating conditions. The research finally focused on the integrated system which brought the heat pipe solar collector, boiler and micro turbine together. The individual components, configurations and layout of the system were illustrated. Theoretical analysis was carried out to investigate thermodynamic cycle and heat transfer contained in the combined system, which is based on the assumption that the system operated on a typical Rankine cycle powered by both solar and gas energy. Tests for the prototype system was carried out to realistically evaluate its performance. Two types of turbine units were examined; one is an impulse-reaction turbine, and the other is a turbo-alternator. The turbo-alternator was found to be too small in capacity for this system thereby affecting its output significantly. The micro impulse reaction turbine was considered a better option. A typical testing showed that the majority of heat required for the turbine operation came from the boiler (7. 65 kW), and very little (0. 23 kW) from the solar collector. The gas consumption was 8. 5 kW. This operation resulted in an electricity output and domestic hot water generation, which were 1. 34 kW and 3. 66 kW respectively. The electrical efficiency was 16 % and the thermal efficiency was 43 %, resulting in an overall efficiency of 59 %. Increasing the number of the collectors used would result in reduced heat output from the boiler. This would help in improving system performance and increasing efficiencies. In this application, number of collectors used would be 4 as the flue gas flow rate would only be sufficient to provide 4 to 5 such collectors for heat recovery. The research resulted in the proposal of another system configuration. The innovative concept is illustrated in Chapter 8, and its key technical issues are discussed.
