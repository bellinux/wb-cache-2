Unfortunately they directed most of it towards avoidance of defeat during a seven-act performance which most of us were naive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> was staged primarily for public entertainment and which was financed by the public.|$|E

A white woman once asked Tubman whether she {{believed}} women {{ought to have the}} vote, and received the reply: [...] "I suffered <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it." [...] Tubman began attending meetings of suffragist organizations, and was soon working alongside women such as Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{returned}} {{to the issue of}} abortion in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart, in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the Stenberg case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: [...] "I am optimistic <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that, one day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place {{in the history of this}} Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method of killing a human child... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion".|$|E

500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees {{before he can}} get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E

"Though {{he and his}} {{excellent}} {{wife were}} of different churches, they never disagreed {{on the subject of}} religion; they found <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in common to make them good Christians.

2500|$|In June 2014, Mick {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) as Mick is attempting to overcome his fear of water and learn to swim. It was reported that this would [...] "help a grieving Ian {{just as much as}} Mick." [...] It was then reported that Mick would be arrested when he helps Ian track down Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), a prostitute that Ian had sex with on the night his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was murdered. A show source said, [...] "Mick has no idea what he's getting into when he agrees to help Ian. We all know that Mick is one of the good guys and would never try to pick up a prostitute. He'll be praying that Linda trusts him <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he's innocent." [...] The episodes where Mick takes part in a charity swim and is arrested for kerb-crawling were originally broadcast from 4 to 8 August 2014. A promotional trailer for the episodes was released on 30 July.|$|E

5000|$|From Serican-occupied Nihonia, Tora is an {{engineer}} and a scientist. He refers to himself as a follower of Yinshaya: a [...] "total submission to reason". Tora is irritated {{by the fact that}} Rome has little understanding of technology: pretty much all modern technology was invented by former Emperor Fabius or the Greek Ptolemaeus. He develops a biplane between the Roman conquest of the Aztec Empire and Nepos' coup, called a cloud-galley by the Romans. Tora returns to the Serican Empire, where he becomes a vassal to the Xing Emperor, though remaining loyal <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> Germanicus <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he has survived and will regain his empire.|$|R
