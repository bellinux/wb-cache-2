40|$|Summary To {{test whether}} the altitudinal {{distribution}} of trees {{is determined by}} a carbon shortage or an insufficient sugar fraction (sugar:starch ratio) <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees, we studied the sta-tus of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and their compo-nents (total soluble sugars and starch) in Abies fabri (Mast.) Craib and Picea balfouriana var. hirtella Rehd. et Wils. trees along three elevational gradients, ranging from lower eleva-tions to the alpine treeline, on {{the eastern edge of}} the Tibetan Plateau. For comparison, we investigated a low-altitude spe-cies (Tsuga yunnanensis (Franch.) Pritz.) which served as a warm-climate reference because it is distributed in closed montane forests below 3100 m a. s. l. in the study area. The car-bon status of T. yunnanensis responded to altitude differently from that of the treeline species. At the species level, total NSC was not consistently more abundant <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees than <b>in</b> trees of the same species growing at lower elevations. Thus there was no consistent evidence for carbon limitation of growth <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees. For the three treeline species studied (P. balfouriana and A. fabri in the Kang-Ding Valley and A. fabri in the Mo-Xi Valley), winter NSC concentrations <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees were significantly lower than in lower-elevation trees of the same species, suggesting that, in winter, carbon is limited <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees. However, <b>in</b> no case was there total overwinter depletion of NSC or its components <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> trees. Treeline and low-altitude species had similar sugar:starch ra-tios of about three at their upper-elevational limits in April. We conclude that survival and growth of trees at the elevational or latitudinal climate limit depend not only on NSC concentration in perennial tissues, but also on the maintenance of an over-wintering sugar:starch ratio greater than three...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of tropical palaeoclimates {{is crucial for}} understanding global climate change, {{because it is a}} test bench for general circulation models that are ultimately used to predict future global warming. A longstanding issue concerning the last glacial maximum in the tropics is the discrepancy between the decrease in sea-surface temperatures reconstructed from marine proxies and the high-elevation decrease in land temperatures estimated from indicators of <b>treeline</b> elevation. <b>In</b> this study, an improved inverse vegetation modeling approach is used to quantitatively reconstruct palaeoclimate and to estimate the effects of different factors (temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration) on changes <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation based on a set of pollen data covering an altitudinal range from 100 to 3, 140 m above sea level in Africa. We show that lowering of the African treeline during the last glacial maximum was primarily triggered by regional drying, especially at upper elevations, and was amplified by decreases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and perhaps temperature. This contrasts with scenarios for the Holocene and future climates, in which the increase <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation will be dominated by temperature. Our results suggest that previous temperature changes inferred from tropical treeline shifts may have been overestimated for low-CO 2 glacial periods, because the limiting factors that control changes <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation differ between glacial and interglacial periods...|$|R
30|$|Various {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that treeline position is sensitive to temperature changes and climate warming has caused an increase <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation over time (e.g. Brubaker, 1986; Lloyd and Fastie, 2003; Danby and Hik, 2007; Leonelli et al., 2011) {{and is likely to}} cause further increases <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>in</b> the future (Munier et al., 2010). Increasing temperatures can provide a possible mechanism for abrupt increases in recruitment (Hessl and Baker, 1997; Elliott and Kipfmueller, 2011). Tree growth and survival at some upper timberlines are strongly limited by the low-temperature among the main factors controlling the treeline altitude (Tranquillini, 1979; Stevens and Fox, 1991; Körner, 2003; Holtmeier, 2009). In some altitudinal regions, radial growth of trees is driven by summer temperatures (LaMarche and Fritts, 1971; Eckstein and Aniol, 1981; Schweingruber et al., 1991; Bradley and Jones, 1993). There have been strong links between increased recruitment and warmer temperatures during the growing season and the cool seasons at treeline ecotones (Elliott and Baker, 2004; Danby and Hik, 2007; Holtmeier and Broll, 2007; Harsch et al., 2009; Kullman and Öberg, 2009).|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to documented increases in woody plant dominance of former savannas and grasslands of North America, oak (Quercus L.) savannas that form lower <b>treelines</b> <b>in</b> the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico {{have been relatively}} stable over the past millennium. This research identified potential biotic and abiotic constraints on seedling recruitment of Quercus emoryi Torr. (Emory oak) {{within the context of}} potential shifts <b>in</b> lower <b>treeline.</b> Field surveys were used to describe seedling distribution at and below lower treeline, and to determine the potential for acorn dispersal from lower treeline into adjacent grassland. Field and greenhouse experiments designed to determine constraints on seedling establishment included reciprocal soil transfers, nutrient amendment studies, provision of artificial shade, and manipulation of seasonal precipitation inputs. Results indicate that rates of Q. emoryi recruitment within grasslands below treeline are relatively low, and are constrained by low rates of seed dispersal coupled with a low probability of seedling emergence. Seedling recruitment rates were directly correlated with quantity of summer precipitation, but were independent of winter precipitation. Results of this and complementary research suggest that lower <b>treeline</b> <b>in</b> southern Arizona is stabilized by self-enhancing feedback mechanisms of overstory shade, seed dispersal, and seedling establishment coupled with strong abiotic constraints beyond the current ecotone. The observed shift <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>in</b> the last millennium was less likely the result of slow, spatial progression of autogenic safe sites than the result of episodic and infrequent allogenic processes that simulated, or negated the importance of, conspecific, biogenic safe sites. Increases in summer precipitation are one such process that would facilitate (historic or potential future) downslope shifts <b>in</b> lower <b>treeline.</b> This interpretation is consistent with observations that downslope shifts <b>in</b> lower <b>treeline</b> which occurred 700 - 1700 ybp coincided with a period of particularly high summer precipitation in the region (i. e., the "Medieval Warm" period, 645 - 1295 ybp) ...|$|R

40|$|Transition zones between {{mountain}} {{forests and}} treeless tundra, i. e. treeline ecotones, {{are characterized by}} great regional variety. In this paper, we discuss the biodiversity in various trophic levels <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> ecotones throughout Europe, with particular focus on recent changes in land use and climate in northern and central mountains. In northernmost Europe, mountain birch prevails, while conifers (spruce, pine, larch) are the dominating species further south. While at continent-wide to global scales, the ecotone position is largely controlled by heat deficiency, it depends on a multitude of partly interacting abiotic and biotic factors other than climate at smaller scales. Climate change is a driving factor <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> ecotone change, including physiognomic structure and biodiversity, although the effects of climate and other factors often overlap. Historical legacy {{plays an important role}} in this respect, and human impacts are particularly important. The recent decline in pastoral use of many European treeline areas often strongly influences plant diversity and re-growth of trees and other woody species. Climate change together with changing tree cover may influence snow cover, moisture regime, and nutrient conditions. Subsequently changed site conditions influence plant−plant interactions, favoring some species and disfavoring others, and plant−animal interactions. Native animals may cause widespread or local disturbances <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> ecotone areas. Mass outbreaks of leaf-eating insects, for example, usually affect comparatively large forested areas whereas mammalian herbivores and birds have more local impact. However, high numbers of wild or domestic mammalian herbivores may challenge the carrying capacity of treeline ecotone areas at the same time as they preserve an open pasture character. This calls for cross-disciplinary study approaches, addressing the complexity of the ecotone regarding both causal background and biogeographic diversity.

40|$|Altitudinal treelines are {{typically}} temperature limited such that increasing temperatures linked to {{global climate change}} are causing upslope shifts of treelines worldwide. While such elevational increases are readily predicted based on shifting isotherms, at the regional level the realized response is often much more complex, with topography and local environmental conditions playing an important modifying role. Here, we used repeated aerial photographs in combination with forest inventory data to investigate changes <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> position <b>in</b> the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan over the last 60 years. A highly spatially variable upslope advance of <b>treeline</b> was identified <b>in</b> which topography is a major driver of both treeline form and advance. The changes <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> position that we observed occurred alongside substantial increases in forest density, and lead to a large increase in overall forest area. These changes will {{have a significant impact}} on carbon stocking in the high altitude zone, while the concomitant decrease in alpine grassland area is likely to have negative implications for alpine species. The complex and spatially variable changes that we report highlight the necessity for considering local factors such as topography when attempting to predict species distributional responses to warming climate...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationships}} between treeline elevation and climate at regional and local scales. It is compelling to fill this research gap with data from the Tibetan Plateau where some of the highest alpine <b>treelines</b> <b>in</b> the world are found. This research question partially results from the lack of in situ temperature data at treeline sites. Herein, treeline variables (e. g., elevation, topography, tree species) and temperature data were collected from published investigations performed during this decade on the Tibetan Plateau. Temperature conditions near treeline sites were estimated using global databases and these estimates were corrected by using in situ air temperature measurements. Correlation analyses and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effects of different variables on treeline elevation including thermal (growing-season air temperatures) and non-thermal (latitude, longitude, elevation, tree species, precipitation, radiation) factors. The commonality analysis model was applied to explore how several variables (July mean temperature, elevation of mountain peak, latitude) were related to treeline elevation. July mean temperature was the most significant predictor of treeline elevation, explaining 55 % of the variance <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation across the Tibetan Plateau, whereas latitude, tree species, and mountain elevation (mass-elevation effect) explained 30 % of the variance <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> elevation. After considering the multicollinearity among predictors, July mean temperature (largely due to the influence of minimum temperature) still showed the strongest association with treeline elevation. We conclude that the coupling of treeline elevation and July temperature at a regional scale is modulated by non-thermal factors probably acting at local scales. Our results contribute towards explaining the decoupling between climate warming and treeline dynamics...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAbove-average {{climate warming}} {{occurred}} during the 20 th century in high altitude regions, and alpine treelines {{are believed to be}} an early indicator to respond to these warming-related changes. However, empirical investigations on treeline dynamics showed diverse results. The main objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate if treeline position shifted and if tree recruitment changed along with climate warming, and (2) to test if adult trees have “nursing effect” on tree establishment at treelines. We investigated two Balfour spruce (Picea balfouriana Rehd. et Wils.) <b>treelines</b> <b>in</b> Chang Niang (CNT) and Dang Dui (DDT), Dingqing county, Changdu prefecture, eastern Tibet. At each treeline site, three replicate plots with a size 30 m× 50 m were established. The coordinates of each tree within the plots were recorded and the age of each tree was identified by dendrochronological method. The changes <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> position and tree recruitment were examined from spatially fine-scale distribution of trees and their age structure. The spatial patterns of individual trees were analyzed to infer the neighborhood effects. Results indicate that plots CNT 2, CNT 3, DDT 1 and DDT 2 showed stable treeline position during the last century, whereas plots CNT 1 and DDT 3 showed treeline advancing movement. Tree recruitments in all the six plots were enhanced during the 20 th century, with two peaks occurring in the 1890 – 1910 s and the 1950 – 1990 s. Seedlings and saplings showed a general clustered distribution in all the six plots. The diverse pattern of treeline movement and episodic regeneration suggest that the treeline activity is not merely a result of climate change. “Nursing effects” from adult trees may play an important role <b>in</b> shaping the <b>treeline</b> activities on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our findings reveal diverse patterns <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> dynamics at a local scale and highlight the importance of incorporating biotic interactions into species distribution modeling approaches...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Climate-growth {{relationships}} <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> {{forests are}} particularly informative because {{they represent the}} upper limit of a species range where growth is often especially sensitive to climatic variation. Radial growth response to climatic variables typically ranges from energy-limited to water-limited. In the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of North America, treeline forests are typically energy-limited. Results from a recent study (Marcinkowski et al. 2015) indicate a change in climate-growth relationships over time <b>in</b> <b>treeline</b> mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) in northern Washington State. Here, we investigate whether these same changes occured across 700 km {{of the range of}} <b>treeline</b> mountain hemlock <b>in</b> Oregon and Washington. Using cores from trees > 200 years old, we examined temporal and spatial variability of climate-growth relationships since the early 20 th Century. Results indicate (1) a change in the climate variables influencing energy limitation in forest growth at treeline, (2) growth response to climate variables changes through time, (3) patterns of growth response to climate are similar between chronologies from similar latitudes, (4) and variable patterns of growth response to climate between chronologies from different topographic aspects. Correlations between radial growth and climate vary from significantly positively correlated to significantly negatively correlated for some variables. These results helped identify where changes in growth-limiting variables may be occurring, and suggest that the effects of a warmer climate on growth at treeline will be more complex temporally and spatially than has been suggested by previous analyses...|$|R
