When uniform mixing of the dust is assumed, the solar heating per unit mass during a Martian global dust storm is remarkably uniform with height for small solar zenith angles. Heating rates may reach 80 K/day for overhead sunlight. Overall, 20 % of the direct insolation is absorbed by the dust-laden atmosphere.

Between the ranges occur broad, flat, cauldron-shaped valleys and basins, almost destitute of life except for a few hares and a few birds, such as the crow and the pheasant, and with scanty vegetation, but no great accumulations of drift-sand. The rocks are severely weathered on the surface, a thick layer of the coarser products of denudation covers the flat parts and climbs a good way up the flanks of the mountain ranges, but all the finer material, sand and clay has been blown away partly southeast into the Ordos, partly into the Chinese provinces of Shen-si and Shan-si, where it is deposited as loess, and partly west, where it chokes all the southern parts of the basin of the Tarim. In these central parts of the Gobi, as indeed in all other parts except the desert of Lop and Ordos, the prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest. These winds are warm in summer, and it is they which in the desert of Hami bring the fierce sandstorms or burans. The wind does blow also from the northeast, but it is then cold and often brings snow, which clears the air of the usual <b>dust</b> <b>haze.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} to the differentiation of two phenomena, Asian <b>Dust</b> and <b>haze,</b> which are extremely difficult to distinguish based solely on comparisons of PM 10 concentration, through use of the Optical Particle Counter (OPC), which simultaneously generates PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration. In the case of Asian Dust, PM 10 concentration rose {{to the exclusion of}} PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration. The relative ratios of PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration versus PM 10 concentration were below 40 %, which is consistent with the conclusion that Asian Dust, as a prime example of the coarse-particle phenomenon, only impacts PM 10 concentration, not PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration. In contrast, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration simultaneously increased with haze. The relative ratios of PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration versus PM 10 concentration were generally above 70 %. In this case, PM 1. 0 concentration varies because a haze event consists of secondary aerosol in the fine-mode, and the relative ratios of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentration remain intact as these values already subsume PM 1. 0 concentration. The sequential shift of the peaks in PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentrations also serve to individually track the transport of coarse-mode versus fine-mode aerosols. The distinction in the relative ratios of PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0 concentration versus PM 10 concentration in an Asian <b>Dust</b> versus a <b>haze</b> event, when collected on a national or global scale using OPC monitoring networks, provides realistic information on outbreaks and transport of Asian <b>Dust</b> and <b>haze...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>haze</b> conditions, {{typical of}} the African {{atmosphere}} south of the Sahara, {{are a result of}} wind-generated dust from arid lands. The magnitude of the <b>dust</b> <b>haze</b> is evaluated for the 30 -year period beginning in 1957 by calculating the number of occurrences where the observed visibility was reduced below threshold values of 10 km and 5 km. The frequency of low visibility was several times greater for the 1977 - 1986 period than for the 1957 - 1966 period. Large decreases in visibility are observed after the severe droughts of 1972 - 1973 and 1982 - 1984. Contrasting regional differences of the dustiness evolution are noticed. These differences are closely related to the differences in the regional rainfall evolution.

40|$|Brown dwarfs are substellar {{objects with}} core {{temperatures}} insufficient for sustained hydrogen fusion. Their physical properties such as mass, temperature, and radius {{are similar to}} those of gas giant planets, so studying brown dwarfs may also benefit exoplanet studies. There is a population of ’red’ L dwarfs, which have redder J − K colors in the near-infrared than normal objects. Red L dwarfs include young, low-gravity objects, which are systematically red, and red field-gravity objects. The observed reddening in L dwarfs is not well explained by current atmosphere models. We present an analysis of red L dwarfs using our model which includes small, sub-micron size dust particles in the upper atmosphere in addition to the cloud decks common to all L dwarfs which consist of larger particles. We hypothesize that the red NIR colors of some L dwarfs could be explained by a “dust haze" of small particles. We developed a model which combines Mie theory and Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the proposed <b>dust</b> <b>haze.</b> We apply our analysis to 20 young L dwarfs and 36 red field L dwarfs. We constrain the properties of the <b>dust</b> <b>haze</b> including particle size distribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Current brown dwarf atmosphere models include large grain (∼ 10 μm) dust clouds but not ISM-size small dust grains. Our results provide a proof of concept and motivate a combination of large and small dust grains in brown dwarf atmosphere models.

40|$|The aeolian {{accumulation}} of natural atmospheric dust {{in a desert}} environment was investigated during a 24 -month experiment. Accumulation was measured with marble collectors every month. At the same time, wind speed, dust concentration, dew formation and rainfall were recorded. Atmospheric stability was measured from a 90 m tower several km from the test site. Dust accumulation by day was systematically higher than dust accumulation at night. Also, dust concentration was higher, but the higher concentrations cannot completely explain the higher accumulation values. Both average monthly concentration and accumulation are considerably influenced by the occurrence: of high-magnitude dust events, either dust storms or <b>dust</b> <b>hazes.</b> The <b>dust</b> that accumulated at night was systematically coarser than the dust that accumulated during the day. No seasonal trend was observed in the grain size of the sediment. The velocity of accumulation, defined as the ratio between accumulation and concentration, varied between 1. 18 m. s(- 1) and 4 - 53 m. s(- 1). Dew formation {{did not seem to}} have a serious impact upon dust accumulation, whereas wind erosion, and especially the erosion occurring during heavy gusts, appears to play a very important role, since these gusts may be able to blow away large amounts of sediment that accumulated during the preceding hours, days or even weeks.

40|$|At Sede Boqer (northern Negev desert, Israel), aeolian dust {{dynamics}} {{have been}} measured since 1986. The data are somewhat preliminary {{for the first}} 2 years, bur from 1988 onward, the data set is nearly complete and contains ample information with respect to northern Negev dust. In this paper, several dynamic aspects of the Negev dust are investigated for the decade 1988 - 1997. Airborne dust concentration, which was measured by total particulate ultrahigh-volume sampling at 1 -m height, was {{of the order of}} 120 mug m (- 3) (based on 24 -h measuring intervals) as an average, with higher values during the day than at night. Concentration was also higher during spring and autumn compared to summer and winter. In the decade 1988 - 1997, dust concentration decreased from 1988 to 1992 and increased from 1992 to 1997. Systematic oscillations with a periodicity of 30 months occur in the concentration curves. Dust accumulation, which was measured in marble collectors installed at ground level, was of the order of 10 - 25 gm (- 2) month (- 1), with an average value of 17. 1 gm (- 2) month (1). The accumulation rate was higher during the day hours than during the night. There was a tendency for the accumulation to be highest in February and then gradually decrease until the following January, but considerable scatter occurs in this trend. During 1988 - 1997, dust accumulation at Sede Boqer sharply decreased in the first 2 years, increased during the next 4 years, and more or less stabilized from 1995 onward. There was no agreement between the temporal evolution of the velocity of accumulation v(a) and the temporal evolutions of dust concentration, dust accumulation or wind speed. Most high-magnitude dust events (defined in this study as events with an average airborne dust concentration {{greater than or equal to}} 400 mug m (- 3)) occurring at Sede Boqer are true dust storms, which occur predominantly during the day hours. During the period 1988 - 1991, dust storms and <b>dust</b> <b>hazes</b> were equally abundant, but from 1992 onward the high-magnitude dust events were nearly exclusively dust storms. The distribution of dust storms and <b>dust</b> <b>hazes</b> over the year is different: the former are mainly concentrated in the period November-May, whereas the latter occur anywhere in the year. True dust storms are usually associated with local cyclonic activity, but may also be connected to local thunderstorm cells (haboob-type dust storms). At Sede Boqer, there is no correlation in the wet season between rainfall and dust activity. A significant correlation exists between rainfall (in the wet season) and dust activity in the next dry season: wet seasons with low rainfall are followed by dry seasons with high dust activity, and wet seasons with high rainfall are followed by dry seasons with low dust activity. The time lag between rainfall intensity and dust activity is most probably caused by the dust crust on the desert floor, which is much stronger after rain seasons with high precipitation than after rain seasons with low precipitation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} blowing dust on {{transport}} operations are often mentioned {{as one of}} the significant impacts of aeolian processes on human welfare. However, few studies have been presented to demonstrate this impact. This research examined official air traffic incident reports in Australia for inclusively 1969 - 2010 to characterise the hazard of blowing dust to aviation in the country, the first such study of its kind. For the 42 year record, 61 incidents were identified (mean 1. 4 per annum), with the large majority occurring {{in the first half of}} the 1970 s. Only 20 % of incidents occurred from 1984 onwards. Australian dust activity has not decreased over time, and the reduction in incidents is partly explained by improvements in aviation technology. The centralisation of Air Traffic Control operations to major coastal cities may however have reduced pilot reporting of dust-induced aviation incidents. By type of dust activity, dust storms were associated with nearly half of the reported incidents and <b>dust</b> <b>hazes</b> produced around a quarter. Only 5 % of incidents resulted in any physical damage to aircraft and only one case involving personal injury was reported. The majority of the adverse effects on aviation due to dust (nearly 60 % of reported incidents) were related to difficulties for navigation and completion of scheduled journey. Since aircraft damage and bodily harm were rare, the impact of dust in Australia is mostly that of inconvenience and associated raised economic costs. From 1990, the temporal pattern of incidents does not show any significant increase despite several intensely dusty years associated with recent droughts. This suggests that Australian aviation safety may be relatively resistant to the adverse effects of atmospheric dust as a hazard. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
