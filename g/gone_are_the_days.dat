The pieces from Delyte Morris’ presidency show a dedication to a very specific vision he had: to create a university that is both supporting {{of the students and}} pushing towards advancement. He and C. D. May, the associate architect for the university, supported this idea by buying furnishings that were manufactured in Illinois and sticking to a strict budget. By choosing post-WWII, mid-century modern furniture, the interior design of the university appealed to many of the new students at the school; middle-class suburbanites who wanted sophisticated, clean designs without luxury materials. Herman Miller Inc and Knoll Inc provided a large amount of furniture to the university, much of which is now housed in the Delyte Morris Furniture Collection in the University Museum Archives. Even after the end of his presidency, Delyte Morris’ legacy drew on, in part through the Knoll Inc furniture that was acquired because of its connection to handmade fabric and wooden bases. The pieces in this collection directly mirror the progression of Southern Illinois University, and its dedication to being a campus that is constantly expanding, yet with strong Illinois roots...|$|R

At this point, the form of the grid began to take precedent on his canvases, almost like a prescient depiction of the boom in technology that would soon arrive. Corinne Robins explains [...] "The new paintings like the old have a tonal feeling; but now, rather than the blare of trumpets, the buzz of an IBM machine making crazy computations comes to mind." [...] In fact, during this time he was a guest artist in 17 art departments around the country. Into the 1980s and 1990s, his paintings would become busier but his colors quieter, favoring razor blade-like shapes over feathery forms and grids.|$|R

[...] Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds) [...] had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church. [...] In all, Julian’s short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past. [...] Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation to rock the boat by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.|$|R

He also started the group Lions of Israel, who he performed with throughout the Midwest starting in 2002. This culminated in 2004, when Joseph and the band were invited to open for Ziggy Marley at a sold-out concert in Fayetteville. His well-received acoustic performance brought Joseph {{to the attention of}} Marley's bassist Chris Meredith, who brought Israel to Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, where he recorded his self-produced and financed debut solo album <b>Gone</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days,</b> released in 2005.

In 2006, Joseph Israel was signed to New Door Records of Universal Music Group, and in 2007 <b>Gone</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> peaked at number 11 on the Top Reggae album charts.

5000|$|For {{over twenty}} years, the Okhrana had focused on {{interfering with the}} {{activities}} of relatively small, and distinct, revolutionary groups. The Revolution of 1905, characterized by seemingly spontaneous marches and strikes, exposed the Okhrana's inefficacy at controlling mass popular movements. [...] Not only did the Okhrana lack the capacity to prevent the mass movements of 1905, or even to contain them once they began, the Okhrana’s misguided attempts may even have worsened the unrest. D. F. Trepov, the Assistant Minister of the Interior in charge of police affairs, and P. I. Rachkovsky, {{now in charge of}} all domestic political police operations, attempted to mount an aggressive offensive against those they believed to <b>be</b> responsible for <b>the</b> unrest, namely zemstvo employees, in May 1905, but backed down three months later. [...] In October of that year, Trepov again attempted a violent repression of the revolution only to call off the effort for lack of manpower. Since these attempts at repression never reached fruition, they only served to aggravate the already enraged Russian populace and to deepen their distrust of the Imperial government. Trepov’s replacement by P.N. Durnovo in late-October ushered in a period of even more vicious repression of the Revolution. [...] Indicative of this new period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> head of the St. Petersburg Special Section, A.V. Gerasimov’s, strike on the St. Petersburg Soviet. To Tsar Nicholas II's delight, Gerasimov arrested delegates of the Soviet en masse on December 3, 1905.
