25|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{connecting}} a keyboard to a system unit (more precisely, to its keyboard controller) using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the PS/2 and the USB connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary Apple Desktop Bus for its <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E

50|$|PS/2 {{mouse and}} <b>keyboard</b> <b>connectors</b> {{have also been}} used in non-IBM PC-compatible {{computer}} systems, such as the DEC AlphaStation line, early IBM RS/6000 CHRP machines and SGI Indy, Indigo 2, and newer (Octane, etc.) computers. Various Macintosh clone computers from the late 1990s featured PS/2 mouse and keyboard ports, including the Motorola StarMax and the Power Computing PowerBase.|$|R

50|$|No further {{commitments}} {{were made}} in 2009 about making the design open and public, {{which would make it}} easier to add additional features such as a standard <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> and increased storage.|$|E
50|$|A further {{expansion}} card intercepted scancodes from the 122-key 3270 keyboard, translating them into XT scancodes {{which were then}} sent to the normal <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector.</b> This keyboard, officially called the 5271 Keyboard Element, weighed 9.3 pounds.|$|E
50|$|ATX {{also made}} the PS/2-style mini-DIN <b>keyboard</b> and mouse <b>connectors</b> ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5-pin DIN <b>connector</b> for the <b>keyboard</b> and were {{generally}} used with serial port mice (although PS/2 mouse ports were also found on some systems). Many modern motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style <b>keyboard</b> and mouse <b>connectors</b> {{in favor of the}} more modern Universal Serial Bus. Other legacy connectors that are slowly being phased out of modern ATX motherboards include 25-pin parallel ports and 9-pin RS-232 serial ports. In their place are onboard peripheral ports such as Ethernet, FireWire, eSATA, audio ports (both analog and S/PDIF), video (analog D-sub, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort) and extra USB ports.|$|R
50|$|Note: Version 8.0 {{and above}} dropped PS/2 {{support for the}} {{following}} list. As even adapters can't assist, Microsoft keeps version 7.1 as an offered download for users who still own <b>keyboards</b> with PS/2 <b>connectors</b> (instead of USB).|$|R
50|$|The famous {{clam shell}} ADM-3 quickly {{followed}} {{and the first}} manufactured units were shipped in mid 1974. It set another new industry low single unit price of $1,195. Its innovative wave soldered single board design, which included the <b>keyboard</b> and all <b>connectors,</b> was packaged in an original clam shell enclosure.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Octek Jaguar V {{motherboard}} from 1993. This {{board has}} few onboard peripherals, {{as evidenced by}} the 6 slots provided for ISA cards and the lack of other built-in external interface connectors. Note the large AT <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> at the back right is its only peripheral interface.|$|E
50|$|As {{the first}} decade of the 21st century progressed, the legacy-free PC went mainstream, with legacy ports removed from {{commonly}} available computer systems in all form factors. However the PS/2 <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> remains in widespread use, as it offers some advantages (e.g. easier implementation of N-Key rollover) over the USB.|$|E

5000|$|The Smart Display was a {{battery-powered}} 10" [...] or 15" [...] LCD monitor with a touchscreen (similar in {{size and}} shape to a Tablet PC), connecting to a PC over an 802.11b WiFi network, with input via Transcriber (similar to Graffiti) or a pop-up soft-keyboard for text entry, and built-in speakers. Some models had a docking unit with wired PC, <b>keyboard</b> and mouse <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The kits were {{a perfect}} vehicle to sell Maplin's {{components}} and {{the articles in}} Electronics published full circuit diagrams, parts lists and technical articles with full instructions for building and setting up the projects. All this happened in the early 1980s, and the sudden boom in home computer ownership spawned by manufacturers such as Sinclair, Commodore International and Atari created opportunities for Maplin to create home build project kits to plug into these computers such as speech synthesisers, memory expansion cards, extension <b>keyboards,</b> cables, and <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{consumer}} electronics, the term [...] "DIN connector" [...] commonly refers {{to a member of}} a family of circular connectors that were initially standardized by DIN for analog audio signals. Some of these connectors have also been used in analog video applications, for power connections and for digital interfaces such as MIDI or the IBM AT computer <b>keyboard</b> (later PS/2 <b>connectors</b> for <b>keyboard</b> and mouse are Mini-DIN connectors). The original DIN standards for these connectors are no longer in print and have been replaced with the equivalent international standard IEC 60130-9.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the back}} of the {{computer}} case, some major changes were made to the AT standard. Originally AT style cases had only a <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> and expansion slots for add-on card backplates. Any other onboard interfaces (such as serial and parallel ports) had to be connected via flying leads to connectors which were mounted either on spaces provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot positions.|$|E
50|$|Although the PC/XT and AT {{used the}} same style of <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector,</b> the {{low-level}} protocol for reading the keyboard was different between these two series. The AT keyboard uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the keyboard. An AT keyboard {{could not be used}} in an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided a switch on some of their keyboards to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the keyboard.|$|E
50|$|Like all early optical mice, {{their debut}} product {{relied on a}} special {{metallic}} and reflective mousepad printed with a square grid of grey and blue tracking lines: as the device moved over the pad, LED feedback was processed by an on-board microchip, which in turn supplied the host computer with machine-readable tracking data via an RS-232 serial port. An external power supply was required. Some mice would derive their power supply from the <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> on the motherboard and came with a pass-through connector to be inserted before the keyboard cable.|$|E
5000|$|Didaktik Gama was {{the first}} clone of the ZX Spectrum with one speciality: 80 KB RAM divided into two {{switched}} 32 KB memory banks and 16 KB of slower RAM containing graphical data for video output, while the size of ROM was 16 KB. This computer had become an unreachable dream for many children and adults in former socialist Czechoslovakia as the computer was considerably expensive and seldom available to buy. It is said there were waiting lists several years long. The design of the computer was very simple â€” just a grey or black box the size of A5 with flat plastic <b>keyboard</b> and <b>connectors</b> mounted on the rear side. All games developed for the ZX Spectrum 48K were generally compatible with this computer. There {{is no need to}} say that it established massive and flourishing black market with these games country-wide as they were officially unavailable behind the [...] "iron curtain". An audio cassette was used as the data store and a TV served as the monitor.|$|R
5000|$|Keyboard hardware: Hardware keyloggers {{are used}} for {{keystroke}} logging {{by means of a}} hardware circuit that is attached somewhere in between the computer keyboard and the computer, typically inline with the <b>keyboard's</b> cable <b>connector.</b> There are also USB connectors based Hardware keyloggers as well as ones for Laptop computers (the Mini-PCI card plugs into the expansion slot of a laptop). More stealthy implementations can be installed or built into standard keyboards, so that no device is visible on the external cable. Both types log all keyboard activity to their internal memory, which can be subsequently accessed, for example, by typing in a secret key sequence. A hardware keylogger has an advantage over a software solution: it is not dependent on being installed on the target computer's operating system and therefore will not interfere with any program running on the target machine or be detected by any software. However its physical presence may be detected if, for example, it is installed outside the case as an inline device between the computer and the keyboard. Some of these implementations have the ability to be controlled and monitored remotely by means of a wireless communication standard.|$|R
50|$|Maltron {{manufactures}} several {{models of}} keyboards, in {{varying levels of}} adaptation. Lillian Malt's original invention and the company's flagship design known as the Fully Ergonomic 3D Keyboard is the most highly adapted; it incorporates a curved surface for the keyboard, in which the keys' angles and depth are staggered {{to compensate for the}} different lengths and placement of the fingers. An integral trackball mouse is a customer-selectable option at additional cost. Other keyboard types available are single hand keyboards which are ergonomically designed to be used by only the left or right hand, a flat version of the fully ergonomic keyboard, a keyboard designed to be used by a single digit or head stick or mouth stick, and a robust expanded keyboard designed primarily to assist people with cerebral palsy. Maltron keyboards are electrically compatible with IBM PC keyboards and Apple Macintosh <b>keyboards,</b> using USB <b>connectors.</b> Earlier connectors included DIN and PS2 but these are now discontinued.|$|R
50|$|The mkIISR {{increased}} the frame-buffer memory from 16KB to 48KB, allowing for 640Ã—200-pixel graphics or 320Ã—200-pixel double-buffered graphics modes. Additionally, the primitive PC speaker {{was replaced by}} an FM synthesis audio system. Its internal BASIC was also updated to allow usage of this new hardware, {{as well as providing}} mkII and PC-8001 compatibility modes (although a significant proportion of older software would not run properly under these modes). Other changes included the change of one general-purpose expansion slot to a Kanji character ROM expansion slot, a PC-8800 series <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector,</b> and an Atari-style joystick connector.|$|E
50|$|Original PS/2 {{connectors}} {{were black}} or {{had the same}} color as the connecting cable (mainly white). Later the PC 97 standard introduced a color code: the keyboard port, and the plugs on compliant keyboards, were purple; mouse ports and plugs were green. (Some vendors initially used a different color code; Logitech used the color orange for the <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> for a short period, but soon switched to purple.) Today this code is still used on most PCs. The pinouts of the connectors are the same, but most computers will not recognize devices connected to the wrong port.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{original}} Tandy 1000, SX, EX, TX, HX used a proprietary keyboard and keyboard layout {{that was not}} compatible with PC/XT/AT standard then in use. The layout of the keyboard prefigured the IBM model M keyboard introduced with the IBM PS/2 series, with function keys arranged in a row at the top, instead of the left as in the PC and PC XT/AT. Later models of the Tandy 1000 series, such as the 1000 sl and tl and rl series used a keyboard more similar and compatible with the IBM ps/2 series <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> and layout.|$|E
50|$|Although never released, an accessory, {{named the}} VideoWRITER Smart Keyboard, was well under design {{at the time}} of PHIS's {{shut-down}} in 1988, principally by Greg Weinstein. The Smart Keyboard was to be roughly 8-1/2 by 11 inches, one inch thick, with a flip-open and adjustable 8-row by 80-column display, a full keyboard, and special function keys. It included the ability to hold over 20 pages of typing, and would have provided a calculator, multi-alarm clock, calculator, and several other convenience functions. When connected to the VideoWRITER itself through the RJ-14 <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector,</b> documents could be uploaded to the VideoWRITER's floppy disk and printed. The hardware chassis was from Kyocera, and was essentially the same as the RadioShack TRS-100 portable computer.|$|E
5000|$|The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN {{connector}} {{used for}} connecting some keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its {{name comes from}} the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 [...] "serial mouse" [...] connector, while the PS/2 <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> replaced the larger 5-pin/180Â° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 designs on keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use {{a different set of}} commands.|$|E
50|$|Physically {{identical}} connectors may be {{used for}} widely different standards, especially on older personal computer systems, or systems not generally designed according to the current Microsoft Windows compatibility guides. For example, a female 9-pin D-subminiature connector on the original IBM PC could have been used for monochrome video, color analog video (in two incompatible standards), a joystick interface, or for a MIDI musical instrument digital control interface. The original IBM PC also had two identical 5 pin DIN connectors, one used for the keyboard, the second for a cassette recorder interface; the two were not interchangeable. The smaller mini-DIN connector has been variously used for the keyboard and two different kinds of mouse; older Macintosh family computers used the mini-DIN for a serial port or for a <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector</b> with different standards than the IBM-descended systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Tandy 1000 {{was a large}} computer {{almost the}} size of the IBM PC, though with a plastic case over an aluminium lower chassis to reduce weight. The original Tandy 1000 featured a proprietary keyboard port (using an 8-pin DIN connector) along with 2 joystick ports (using 6-pin DIN connectors) {{on the front of the}} case. Unlike the IBM PCs, the T1K had a red hardware reset button located on the front panel directly beside the <b>keyboard</b> <b>connector.</b> (The user could also use the traditional CTRL-ALT-DEL to reset the machine). The rear featured an RGB monitor connector (a standard 9-pin female D-shell compatible with CGA/EGA monitors), an RCA-style composite video-out connector, a single RCA-style monophonic line-level audio connector, a light pen port, and an card-edge connector used to attach a parallel printer. The printer port followed the old Centronics standard and was not fully compatible with the parallel port found on PCs.|$|E
