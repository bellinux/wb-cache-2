5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Portugal, the <b>immediate</b> <b>focus</b> of Brazil's foreign policy was to gain widespread international recognition. The first nation to recognize Brazilian sovereignty was the United States, in May 1825. Other nations followed in establishing diplomatic relations {{over the next}} few years. Portugal recognized the separation in August 1825. The Brazilian government subsequently made it a priority to establish its international borders through treaties with its neighbors. The task of securing recognized frontiers was complicated by the fact that, between 1777 and 1801, Portugal and Spain had annulled their previous treaties setting out the borders between their American colonial empires. However, the Empire was able to sign several bilateral treaties with neighbors, including Uruguay (in 1851), Peru (in 1851 and 1874), the Republic of New Granada (later Colombia, in 1853), Venezuela (in 1859), Bolivia (in 1867) and Paraguay (in 1872). By 1889, most of its borders were firmly established. The remaining issues—including the purchase of the region of Acre from Bolivia which would give Brazil its present-day configuration—were only finally resolved after the country became a republic.|$|E

Stone's <b>immediate</b> <b>focus</b> was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their {{right to free speech}} and to speak at all in public has been earned." [...] Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas.

500|$|An <b>immediate</b> <b>focus</b> during {{pre-production}} was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions {{hired to}} create the costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E

40|$|A visual world {{eye-tracking}} {{study investigated}} the activation and persistence of implicit causality information in spoken language comprehension. We showed that people infer the implicit causality of verbs {{as soon as they}} encounter such verbs in discourse, as is predicted by proponents of the <b>immediate</b> <b>focusing</b> account (Greene & McKoon, 1995; Koornneef & Van Berkum, 2006; Van Berkum, Koornneef, Otten, & Nieuwland, 2007). Interestingly, we observed activation of implicit causality information even before people encountered the causal conjunction. However, while implicit causality information was persistent as the discourse unfolded, it did not have a privileged role as a focusing cue immediately at the ambiguous pronoun when people were resolving its antecedent. Instead, our study indicated that implicit causality does not affect all referents to the same extent, rather it interacts with other cues in the discourse, especially when one of the referents is already prominently in focus...|$|R

40|$|In the United States {{substance}} abuse takes a toll that is costly in {{both economic and}} human terms. In 2005 we paid 467. 7 billion dollars to address the consequences of {{substance abuse}}, and each year we have lost an estimated 537, 000 of our fellows to substance abuse related causes. It {{is important that we}} identify and intervene upon the mechanisms translating risk factors for substance abuse into the related behaviors. This study synthesized life history theory and dual process models of cognition to produce an adaptive and cognitive framework for explaining substance abuse. An <b>immediate</b> survival <b>focus</b> was proposed as a construct representing reliance on implicit cognitive processing for the purpose of quick evaluation and short-term strategy use in dangerous or unpredictable environments. This <b>immediate</b> survival <b>focus</b> was suggested as contributing to false positives in the detection of resources and threats critical to survival (i. e., irrational beliefs), and thus vulnerability to substance abuse. This study tested for an <b>immediate</b> survival <b>focus</b> and produced results consistent with the existence of the construct. A factor theorized to represent the ISF was extracted from constructs known to rely on implicit cognitive processing, and this factor was positively associated with both substance abuse and neighborhood danger, as predicted by the adaptive and cognitive framework advanced. In addition, this construct was negatively associated with prosocial behavior, which is known to operate to the relative exclusion of implicit cognitive processes. The strength of the relationships between the ISF and the study 2 ̆ 7 s constructs was substantial for both sexes, though its relative importance to substance abuse was less for females. For the sample as a whole, the ISF accounted for 38...|$|R
