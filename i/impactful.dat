5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of strategy games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as <b>impactful</b> on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{thirteen}} episode series premiered in Japan on MBS on April 4, 2013 and {{was subsequently}} licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by MVM Entertainment in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in Monthly GFantasy between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by Kodansha Box. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs {{along with a}} host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for its dark animation styles and backgrounds. However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were <b>impactful</b> to the viewer.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka was a {{tributary}} {{state of}} the Ming dynasty for many years. It was during this period that Chinese hegemony was most <b>impactful</b> on Sri Lankan politics and commerce. Sri Lankan kings provided tribute to Chinese emperors {{in the form of}} pearls, Filigreed gold, gems, ivory and valances. Notably, Parakramabahu VI of Kotte established relations with China in 1416 to appease the Yongle Emperor and to win his support and integrate himself with the Chinese emperor following the Ming–Kotte War.|$|E

Bowlby's mother {{received}} several letters while Anthony was serving in the war; however, she did not share any of the letters with her children and because of that, Bowlby had no contact with his father. This was also another <b>impactful</b> event in Bowlby's childhood that could have potentially influenced his key research focus on separation.|$|E
25|$|The tornado {{was part}} of a larger tornado {{outbreak}} with several other destructive tornadoes the same day in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana, as well as significant tornadoes in Alabama and Kansas.

This makes the Tri-State Outbreak the deadliest tornado outbreak, March 18 the deadliest tornado day, and 1925 the deadliest tornado year in U.S. history. There were undoubtedly other less <b>impactful</b> tornadoes, the occurrences of which have been lost to history.|$|E

Dos Santos made an <b>impactful</b> impression on the Galaxy early on, scoring on his club debut against Central FC in the CONCACAF Champions League and then in his league debut against the Sounders. In his first five club matches, he had a goal, an assist or both to total with four goals and five assists in that span.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors may}} {{determine}} the extent to which circular migration is <b>impactful</b> upon the return of the migrant. First, the size of the returning population is important, as large numbers of migrants may form a critical mass necessary for true change to occur. Second, the duration of the absence of the migrants is influential, as too short of an absence brings little change and too long of an absence leads to difficulties in readjustment. Third, it is important to consider social class, as the elite may have a greater impact than unskilled workers. Fourth, the extent to which the origin and destination areas are different can have an effect, as those who migrate to metropolitan areas will have a greater impact if returning to an urban rather than a rural area. Lastly, the quantity and quality of the skills that the migrant acquires while abroad can determine the impact of migration.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the area}} that the Mission blue once {{inhabited}} has been destroyed. The coastal sage and chaparral and the native grassland habitats have seen unnatural human development {{in much of the}} region. The San Mateo County town of Brisbane lies in what may once have been the prime habitat for the butterfly. Near Brisbane, an industrial park and rock quarry have proved damaging to the Mission blue habitat. Generally, the most negative impact is that of residential and industrial development. Aside from development, other human activities have negatively affected the butterfly's habitat. Those activities include cultivation and grazing as well as the oft human assisted abundance of invasive exotic species. Some of the more <b>impactful</b> exotics include the European gorse and pampas grass. In the Golden Gate Recreation Area, thoroughwort is a particular invasive species which is taking over habitat once occupied by the Mission blue's lifeblood, the three species of lupine. Of the threats facing the Mission blue, habitat loss due to human intervention and exotic, invasive species are the two most critical.|$|E

Instead, the player proceeds through the story solely by reading. The story was written by Kai and Tsuzuru Nakamura, and character design was produced by Itaru Hinoue. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinji Orito, Ryō Mizutsuki and Tomohiro Takeshita. Harmonia was described as providing an emotional impact despite its short length, but was said to not be as <b>impactful</b> as other titles developed by Key.|$|E
500|$|The game's overall {{narrative}} {{was highly}} praised by critics; many considered it compelling, engaging, riveting, and mature, and {{viewed it as}} the standout feature of the game. Some believed that the story had an excellent presentation with decent voice-acting, memorable characters, and atmospheric soundtracks. North's performance was particularly praised. Many critics {{thought it was a}} bold attempt by Yager and that the story about mistakes and consequences allowed the game's narrative to exceed its competitors in terms of quality. Some critics believed that Yager deserves respect for successfully creating a message through the story and delivering it to the player, and trying to do something different. Mitch Dyer of IGN thought that the game's narrative made violence [...] "meaningful", and that the story was unexpectedly good and personal. Some believed the story is <b>impactful</b> and at times shocking, and that the plot would make [...] "Modern Warfare 2s nefarious No Russian look pretty tame". The game's choices were praised for being [...] "powerful" [...] despite not offering a branching storyline. Some critics believed that these choices are provocative, organic, <b>impactful,</b> upsetting, and thematically correct, though unsatisfying and sometimes hollow and binary. The endings of the game were praised. Some critics noted that emotionally Spec Ops: The Line is not a pleasant game.|$|E

In {{her role as a}} Black woman, professional, mother, and proud feminist, Beyoncé effectively has shifted mainstream feminism towards a more intersectional practice. Rather than dissociate from mainstream feminism, as many Black feminists of the past have done (due to its exclusionary practices and ignorance of racism and patriarchy's intersection), Beyoncé changes the conversation and mainstream feminism to better suit her own needs. As a widely revered public figure, Beyoncé influences cultural understandings of power and privilege in regards to race and gender, and in claiming feminism as her own, she combats many pervasive stereotypes. And, in speaking out against these hierarchies in the widely popular Self-Titled, Beyoncé contributes to Black feminist discourse in an <b>impactful</b> way." ...|$|E

Despite extreme market debate {{over the future of}} the contract, it was renewed for a second term in 1987. A sweetened contract that strengthened marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself allowed Pepsi to keep supplying soft drinks to BK. Leading up to the decision, Pepsi had sponsored over 100 separate cross-promotions and product tie-ins, including a Fourth of July promotion where BK gave away a free Pepsi with each purchase. This fit into the goals of BK, which was looking for a partner that would provide [...] "outstanding, <b>impactful</b> promotional support." [...] However, the contract only lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola. Accompanying the reintroduction of Coca-Cola, BK introduced its first major chicken sandwich since 1977; the new BK Broiler sandwich was a broiled sandwich targeting more health-conscious customers. The BK Broiler was a rapid hit and within six months of its introduction was selling more than a million units daily system wide.|$|E
500|$|The ferry {{system has}} been criticized for mainly benefiting the well-off and for serving gentrifying {{waterfront}} areas such as Williamsburg. Most of the ferry stops were placed in areas where the annual income is higher than the city average. Additional criticism arose {{from the fact that the}} ferry system was not definitively planned to serve Staten Island. One writer for the Staten Island Advance noted that the only proposed NYC Ferry route to Staten Island, the Stapleton route, was not only unfunded but also redundant to the existing Staten Island Ferry. James Patchett, the president of the NYCEDC, touted it as a substitute to the subway system, but Henry Grabar of Slate Moneybox noted that Patchett's supposition was [...] "ludicrous" [...] since each ferry fits fewer people than a single subway car. According to Grabar, the first half-dozen ferries in service on opening day did not even carry the same number of people in a single subway train. He said that the ferry system was not a way to improve transit access to people in transit-deserts, but as a way to spur economic development along the waterfront. Grabar wrote that subways had been the reason for early ferries' demise in the first place, and that the ferry was not an <b>impactful</b> alternative to subway congestion. However, Grabar also stated that [...] "the commute will be a real delight" [...] for the few who found the ferry convenient enough.|$|E

With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem.

Corriae was highly positive about the game: while finding the initial premise rather contrived, she greatly enjoyed the resultant drama and found the story better than that of Birthright and Conquest. She also praised the game for its gameplay and variety. Keller said the story of Revelation [...] "keeps players on their toes", while praised the gameplay for finding a middle ground between the two physical releases. She called it [...] "a fulfilling conclusion" [...] to Fates. While generally positive about the game as a whole, Sheridan was rather critical of the fact that players needed to buy Revelation as DLC to get the whole story. Gwaltney was less favorable than he was about Birthright and Conquest: while he enjoyed the early tension of a limited party, the ability to expand and strengthen the party sapped away the tension, while he found the story [...] "rather ho-hum and generic" [...] after the more <b>impactful</b> stories of the first two versions. Sullivan of IGN greatly enjoyed the combination of characters and gameplay from Birthright and Conquest, but shared her opinion of the central plot device with Corriae. Carsillo found Revelation the most satisfying due to the obscuring of key plot points in the other versions despite Birthright and Conquest offering greater character insight, along with positively noting its gameplay balance between the two physical releases.|$|E

What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first Iron Man film?" [...] Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in The Avengers. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to [...] "build the audience's relationship [...] him" [...] before his <b>impactful</b> death. The Consultant was written after A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget [...] "for two guys talking". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in Thor, and had him and Coulson [...] "brainstorming {{a way to deal with}} this red tape bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative".|$|E
