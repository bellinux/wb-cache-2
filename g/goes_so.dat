5|$|Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, a young apathetic intern at {{the parks}} department. She cares little for her internship, and often shows {{annoyance}} {{at having to}} complete tasks. Due to her rebellious and emotionless attitude, she is often annoyed by her co-workers, especially Leslie. She has a boyfriend named Derek, who is openly gay and dating another openly gay boy named Ben. Despite being in this relationship, April begins to develop a crush on Andy, as {{he is one of}} the few people that has the ability to make her smile.

5|$|However, {{while he}} cares {{for the welfare}} of the people and of his family, Vayne is willing to use any means {{necessary}} to maintain order and retain power. He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> far as to murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, {{to put an end to}} their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E

5|$|Vithoba's image {{replaces the}} {{traditional}} representation of Buddha, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha artists sculpted {{an image of}} Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This {{can be found in}} the Shivneri Caves. Stevenson <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> far as to call devotees of Vithoba (Vithal-bhaktas) Buddhist Vaishnavas (Bauddho-Vaishnavas), since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth—namely Buddha—avatar of Vishnu. Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Following Connor {{receiving}} Delia's corneas, Chloe {{began to}} become more attached to him. Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> far as blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, {{she has to be}} placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when {{he was trying to get}} pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help. She chooses a facility in California, the night before leaving, she and Kevin make love one last time. She leaves town soon after, having had heartfelt goodbyes with her friends and family. However, she reveals that she still has Billy's sperm in her bag before leaving town. Soon after, Kevin sends her flowers, but she refuses them, and asks that Kevin not visit her, devastating him.|$|E

25|$|Story Telling-The protagonist, Anna Andrianovna, takes {{great pride}} in {{identifying}} herself as a storyteller and poet.

Though she presents her tale as the story of her children's lives, as the novel progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not about Anna's children, but about Anna herself and the way she relates them.|$|E

25|$|William Schaw was {{master of}} works to King James VI of Scotland, {{and was also}} the general warden of all the lodges of Scottish stonemasons. This meant {{he was in charge}} of the erection, repair and {{maintenance}} of all government buildings, and also the running of what was already a fraternity of masons, who ensured that all building work was undertaken by properly qualified persons, and also provided for their own sick and the widows of their members. Schaw formalised the working of the lodges in two sets of statutes, set down on 28 December 1598 and 1599. Many now see these as the beginnings of modern Freemasonry. Robert Cooper, the archivist and writer, <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> far as to call Schaw the Father of Freemasonry.|$|E

25|$|Estimates of {{the extent}} of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Thai chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and {{northern}} Thailand.

One states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of Angkor, and another one <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> {{far as to say that}} Anawrahta even visited Java to receive his tribute. However, Western historians (Harvey, Hall, et al) present a much smaller empire, consisted of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery.

25|$|The book {{begins by}} {{tackling}} {{the origins of}} the solar system, using the nebular hypothesis to explain its formations entirely in terms of natural law. It explains the origins of life by spontaneous generation, citing some questionable experiments that claimed to spontaneously generate insects through electricity. It then appeals to geology to demonstrate a progression in the fossil record from simple to more complex organisms, finally culminating in man—with the Caucasian European unabashedly identified as the pinnacle of this process, just above the other races {{and the rest of the}} animal kingdom. It even <b>goes</b> <b>so</b> far as to connect man’s mental reasoning power with the rest of the animals as an advanced evolutionary step that can be traced backwards through the rest of the lower animals. In this sense, the evolutionary ideas offered in Vestiges aim at being complete and all-encompassing.|$|E
