50|$|The A. B. Brown Station ash {{management}} impoundment {{was formed}} by building a dam to block off the outlet of a natural ravine about 0.5 mi from the Ohio river. The ash pond consists of two dams. The Lower dam (built in 1978) has been classified by the Indiana DNR as a Significant Hazard (State ID#65-7, permit #D-4405, rev 1). The Upper dam (constructed in two phases in 2002 and 2007) was not classified, but has a permit #FW-21909. Liquid wastes being sluiced into the pond include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, FGD belt <b>filter</b> <b>wash</b> down and water sump wastes, pyrites, material removed from the coal pile run-off pond, plant floor drain wash downs, boiler chemical leaning wastes, reverse osmosis system rejects, and rainfall/runoff from the surrounding area.

40|$|Rapid sand filters, {{pressure}} filters, {{and even}} membrane filters must be backwashed regularly—a process that uses potable water. During times of shortage, system operators worry that backwashing filters takes too much {{clean water and}} {{may be tempted to}} cut back. Limiting the <b>filter</b> <b>wash</b> rate or duration is usually not a good idea, because it can compromise water quality and shorten filter media life. To overcome any anxiety about backwashing, systems can find ways to make filter backwashing as efficient as possible. Most plants have the capability to adjust the backwash rate and duration of the cycle. Careful adjust-ments to the backwash pressure assures that neither water nor filter media will be lost. Ways to maximize filter backwashing include surface washing, air scouring, and hand raking to clean the filter media. <b>Filter</b> <b>Wash</b> Water Recycling When a rapid sand filter or membrane filter is back-washed, the backwash water usually goes to a sediment basin or the sewer system.

40|$|Background: Application of some materials, {{in order}} to {{increase}} raw water turbidity and to enhance the efficiency of coagulation process is usual. SFBW recycling due to its relatively high volume (4 of total water production) is usual too. In the USA usually in about 30 of water treatment plants SFBW is recycled directly to the inlet of treatment plant line. This study was achieved {{in order to}} determine the influence of SFBW recycling on coagulants reduction in Jalalieh water treatment plant. Materials and Methods: In this study the samples were taken from raw water and <b>filter</b> <b>wash</b> water effluent. At the first step, the parameters of pH, turbidity, TDS, EC and temperature were examined for both raw water and SFBW. Then the optimum coagulant dosages for raw were determined by Jar test. The optimum coagulant dosages for raw water and the mixture of 4 SFBW and raw water were determined at the next stage. Finally the data was analyzed by SPSS software. Results: The results of this study showed that the mean values of pH for raw water and SFBW were 8. 1 and 7. 73 respectively. The mean values of raw water and SFBW turbidity were 7. 7 and 237 NTU respectively. The mean values of EC for these two conditions were 253. 2 and 240. 7 Î¼s/cm respectively. Conclusion: Although it was observed that by recycling 4 of <b>filter</b> <b>wash</b> water there was a 0. 72 mg/l reduction in ferric chloride, but the difference was not statistically significant in the range of analyzed turbidity (3. 77 25 NTU…...|$|E
30|$|The {{selected}} process/unit is firstly {{divided into}} sinks and sources’ streams. Sinks streams are categorized as inlet streams {{of the selected}} unit/process and the outlet streams are considered as sources. However, freshwater and waste water are also placed under sources category {{as some of the}} waste streams cannot be used/reused as sources to the unit (Mehrdadi et al. 2007). In the sugar process, water requirements are the followings: imbibitions, process water use, lime make up water, flocculants make up water, <b>filter</b> <b>wash,</b> pan house requirements and service water requirements. The use of external supplies should be kept to a minimum, because they inflate the quantity to be disposed of ultimately.

40|$|AbstractOzone {{was added}} to water in a {{recirculating}} rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) culture system {{just prior to the}} culture tanks in order to oxidize nitrite and organic material, improve overall water quality, and assist removal of solids across the microscreen filter. Data from four 8 -week studies on ozonation and an 8 -week no ozone control indicated that adding ozone reduced the mean concentration of TSS by 35 %, COD by 36 %, DOC by 17 %, and color by 82 % within the water entering the culture tanks. Additionally, ozone reduced the mean nitrite concentration by 82 % within the culture tanks. Adding ozone did not affect turbidity. Changes brought on by ozonation, particularly as it affected the characteristics of the suspended solids, also improved suspended solids removal across the TriangelTM filter by an average of 33 %. In addition, adding ozone decreased plugging of the microscreen filter panels, as indicated by an average of 35 % fewer <b>filter</b> <b>wash</b> cycles, 53 % less filter sludge flow produced, and 79 % more settled solids volume in the TriangelTM filter effluents. Comparison of two different ozone dosing rates indicated that adding ozone to our recirculating system at a rate of 0. 025 kg ozone per kilogram feed was nearly as effective as adding ozone at a rate of 0. 036 – 0. 039 kg ozone per kilogram feed...|$|E
