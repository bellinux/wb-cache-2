50|$|A {{destructive}} {{war between}} King Cynan and Hywel raged on Anglesey between 812 and 816, ultimately ending with Cynan's defeat and banishment, and Hywel's {{rise to the}} throne. Coenwulf of Mercia took advantage of Gwynedd's weakness in 817, occupying Rhufoniog (see map) and laying waste to the mountains of <b>Eryri</b> (<b>Snowdonia),</b> the defensive stronghold of Gwynedd. In 818 there was a notable battle at Llanfaes on Anglesey. The combatants are not identified, but the site had been the llys (royal court) of King Cynan.|$|E
50|$|Caerhun (Fort of Rhun) is {{the site}} of the 2nd century minor Roman fort of Canovium, {{situated}} along the Roman road between the larger Roman forts of Deva (at modern Chester) and Segontium (near modern Caernarfon). It is supposed to have been one of Rhun's strongholds, and while definitive evidence of this is lacking, it is circumstantially supported by archeological research and the antiquity of the name Caerhun. Furthermore, it guards an important crossing of the River Conwy at Tal-y-Cafn which leads to the pass at Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen, an entrance to <b>Eryri</b> (<b>Snowdonia),</b> the defensive heartland of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Its military significance would certainly have been noticed by both defenders and potential aggressors.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the {{restored}} line {{is known as}} both Rheilffordd Ucheldir Cymru and Rheilffordd Eryri. Rheilffordd Ucheldir Cymru (Welsh Highland Railway) has been used since 1980 by WHR Ltd. and Rheilffordd <b>Eryri</b> (literally <b>Snowdonia</b> Railway) is the Welsh title used by the FR Co for its WHR operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{bypassed}} by the A55 Expressway in the 1980s, losing its old Edwardian period promenade in the process, which was largely {{replaced by a}} modern one. Penmaenmawr is noted for its spectacular mountain and coastal walks. Nearby are the popular attractions of Bwlch Sychnant (Sychnant Pass) and Mynydd y Dref, and the town also lies partly within <b>Eryri,</b> the <b>Snowdonia</b> National Park.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Menai Strait in 2004 crossed by Telford's 1826 {{suspension}} bridge, with <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> in the background. Control of the Menai {{and access}} to Anglesey (Ynys Môn) was crucial for medieval Gwynedd ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> is a mountainous {{region in}} north west Wales and a {{national}} park of 823 sq mi in area. It {{was the first to}} be designated of the three national parks in Wales, in 1951.|$|R
50|$|It was {{established}} as a National Park in 1952, {{and is the only}} one in the United Kingdom to have been designated primarily because of its spectacular coastline. It is one of three National Parks in Wales, the others being the Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) and <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri).</b>|$|R
50|$|Llanegryn is {{a village}} and a {{community}} in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. It was formerly part of the historic county of Merionethshire (Meirionnydd, Sir Feirionnydd). It is located within Snowdonia National Park south of the <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> mountain range. Travelling by road, it is around 4 mi north-east of Tywyn and 17 mi south-west of Dolgellau. The nearest railway stations are at Tonfanau and Llwyngwril, both less than 3 mi away.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Arfon faces Anglesey (Môn) (see soft mutation) across the Menai, and {{controls}} {{access to that}} strategic strait which has played {{an important part in}} Welsh history. Broadly speaking, it stretched from the peaks of Yr Eifl in the west to Afon Cegin, a stream just east of Bangor, and inland from the shores of the Menai southwards into the heart of <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri),</b> including Dyffryn Nantlle and the strategic Llanberis Pass.|$|R
50|$|The mountain-top {{hamlet of}} Y Rhiw is 3.9 mi to the east. There are fine views of Llŷn towards <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri).</b> On {{the slopes of}} Mynydd Rhiw is a late Stone Age burial chamber, and Neolithic quarries. Nearby on Mynydd y Graig are three hillforts, several hut circles and terraced fields that are thought to date from the late Iron Age; in 1955 a Bronze Age cinerary urn was {{uncovered}} in the village.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many informal, {{historical}} and special purpose regional designations. Some {{such as the}} Highlands of Scotland have or have had, to some extent, formal boundaries. Others such as the London commuter belt are more diffuse. Some such as <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> have a formal boundary in some contexts; in this case as a National Park. Others such as The Fens of eastern England are quite distinctly defined by geography but do not form any official entity.|$|R
50|$|Most of Wales is mountainous. <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> in the {{northwest}} has the highest mountains, with Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) at 1085 m being the highest mountain in England and Wales. To {{the south of the}} main range lie the Arenig Group, Cadair Idris and the Berwyn Mountains. In the northeast of Wales, between the Clwyd Valley and the Dee Estuary, lies the Clwydian Range. The 14 (or possibly 15) peaks over 3000 ft, all in Snowdonia, are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s.|$|R
50|$|In the Mabinogion story Lludd and Llefelys, the red dragon {{fights with}} an invading White Dragon. His pained shrieks cause women to miscarry, animals to perish and plants to become barren. Lludd, king of Britain, {{goes to his}} wise brother Llefelys in France. Llefelys tells him to dig a pit in the centre of Britain, fill it with mead, and cover it with cloth. Lludd does this, and the dragons drink the mead and fall asleep. Lludd imprisons them, still wrapped in their cloth, in Dinas Emrys in <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{dream of}} {{establishing}} a National Centre for Folk Music in Wales was realised after Siamas Cyf, the company created by local volunteers to oversee the project, managed to secure £1.2 of public funding from Gwynedd County Council via their Local Regeneration Fund, (a fund of money awarded to local authorities by the Welsh Assembly); European Objective 1 regional aid; the old Welsh Development Agency {{now part of the}} Welsh Assembly Government's Department of Enterprise, Innovation and Networks; Cronfa Arbrofol <b>Eryri,</b> provided by <b>Snowdonia</b> National Park; and Cist Gwynedd, provided by the Economy and Regeneration Service of Gwynedd County Council.|$|R
50|$|Aberdaron {{stands on}} the shore of Bae Aberdaron (Aberdaron Bay) in a small valley at the {{confluence}} of the Afon Daron and Afon Cyll-y-Felin, between the headlands of Uwchmynydd to the west, and Trwyn y Penrhyn to the east. At the mouth of the bay stand two islands, Ynys Gwylan-Fawr and Ynys Gwylan-Fach, which together are known as Ynysoedd Gwylanod (Seagull Islands). Gwylan-Fawr reaches 108 feet (33 metres) in height. The Llŷn Peninsula is a marine eroded platform, an extension of the <b>Snowdonia</b> (<b>Eryri)</b> massif, with a complex geology including Precambrian rocks. The coastline is rocky, with crags, screes and low cliffs; heather covered hills are separated by valleys occupied by pastures.|$|R
