5|$|News of the Spartan defeat, accordingly, was a {{profound}} shock to Agesilaus, who soon {{returned home to}} Sparta. In the months following Agesilaus' departure, Iphicrates reversed many of the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> the Spartans had made near Corinth, recapturing three of the forts that the Spartans had previously seized and garrisoned. He also launched several successful raids against Spartan allies in the region. Although the Spartans and their oligarchic allies continued to hold Lechaeum {{for the duration of}} the war, they curtailed their operations around Corinth, and no further major fighting occurred in the region.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 2010, {{elections}} for the local councils were held in the municipalities of The Netherlands. The PVV only contested these local elections in the Dutch towns The Hague and Almere, because of a shortage of good candidates. The big <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> were scored indicated that the party and Wilders might dominate the political scene {{in the run-up to}} the parliamentary elections scheduled on 9 June 2010. The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Dutch Labour party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 21 percent of the vote to Labour's 18 percent, preliminary results showed. In The Hague, the PVV had 8 seatsâ€”second to Labour with 10 seats.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E

25|$|Boyd was {{a public}} {{advocate}} for African American civil rights. As early as the 1890s he voiced his concern that whites planned to reverse the civil rights <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> African Americans had made {{in the years after}} the Civil War, and in subsequent years he worked against the Jim Crow laws enacted to enforce segregation.|$|E
25|$|Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had {{to fight}} their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a {{severely}} weakened army. Behind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic guerrilla war, fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> the British had previously made.|$|E

25|$|The {{breakdown}} of Dennard scaling prompted a switch among some chip manufacturers {{to a greater}} focus on multicore processors, but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> would be achieved had Dennard scaling continued. In another departure from Dennard scaling, Intel microprocessors adopted a non-planar tri-gate FinFET at 22 nm in 2012 that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor.|$|E

Tech also caught breaks with two 9-yard <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> caused game officials to stop the clock for measurements. The eighth play of the final drive was Alex Trlica's 52-yard field goal as time expired that sent the game to overtime.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} that the Battle was {{entering}} service in 1937, the Battle had already been rendered obsolete by the rapid advances in aircraft technology were being made at the time. Specifically, the performance and capabilities of fighter aircraft had increased to outstrip the modest performance <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> the light bomber had achieved over its biplane antecedents. In terms of a self-defence capability, the Battle had been armed only with a single Browning machine gun and a trainable Vickers K in the rear position; in service, these proved to be desperately inadequate. Moreover, it lacked other common defensive features of the era, such as an armoured cockpit and self-sealing fuel tanks.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{remained}} iconic to particular segments of society, particularly the elderly, Muldoon faded quickly {{as a force}} on the political scene. His biographer, Barry Gustafson, who described himself as not a Muldoon supporter, wrote that he still served as an active MP for his Tamaki electorate, dealing immediately with matters {{from all walks of}} life. He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen {{as a result of the}} free market reforms was worse than the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> were made, a view that came to be popular by the time of the Fifth Labour Government in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Italy, {{nominally}} {{allied with}} the German Empire and the Empire of Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, in 1915 joined the Allies into the war with a promise of substantial territorial <b>gains,</b> <b>that</b> included western Inner Carniola, former Austrian Littoral, Dalmatia as well as parts of the Ottoman Empire. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army get struck in a long attrition war in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. The Italian victory {{marked the end of}} the war on the Italian Front, secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the First World War less than two weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of North Borneo {{took place}} during the Second World War between Allied and Japanese forces. Part of the wider Borneo {{campaign}} of the Pacific War, it was fought between 10 June and 15 August 1945 in North Borneo (later known as Sabah). The battle involved a series of amphibious landings by Australian forces on various points on the mainland around Brunei Bay and upon islands situated around the bay. Japanese opposition to the landings was sporadic initially, although as the campaign progressed a number of considerable clashes occurred and both sides suffered relatively significant casualties. Ultimately, however, the Australians were successful in seizing control of the region, although to a large extent the strategic <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> possession of North Borneo provided the Allies with were ultimately negated by the sudden conclusion of the war in August 1945.|$|E

25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E
25|$|Hitler's {{diplomatic}} {{strategy in}} the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war {{if they were not}} met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance ("axis") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936â€“39), annexed Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and World War II beganâ€“ somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.|$|E
25|$|While the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) {{was a major}} {{beneficiary}} of the Arusha accords {{and was able to}} redress many of its grievances, many of the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power {{of the participants in the}} two following ways: a ceasfire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations. Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction's importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF's position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.|$|E

25|$|The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is {{described}} as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or concentric circles the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out {{of the success of the}} NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include Joe Slovo, Joel Netshitenzhe and Tshilidzi Marwala.|$|E
25|$|While {{the allies}} were at Brussels making dispositions to {{march to the}} relief of Mons, Saxe slipped down the Scheldt with {{the main body of}} the army towards his real target; one column on the left bank of the river, and two columns on the right to cover the march and engage the allies in battle. The capture of Tournai would {{consolidate}} and extend the <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> had been made in the previous campaign, and provide the French with the key to the approaches of Ghent and Oudenarde, threatening British communications with Ostend and the sea. Yet the siege was also a decoy for a much more original manoeuvre â€“ the prompt engagement of the enemy in a place favourable to the French army, and at a time before the allies could reach their full strength. Although Saxe favoured movement over siege warfare he knew there was nothing more likely to provoke an early encounter than to threaten one of the allies' larger fortresses, which only the most confident and able commander could ignore.|$|E
25|$|Israel ranks tenth in {{the world}} for the number of patent {{applications}} filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the European Patent Office (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as IBM, Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlettâ€“Packard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationalsâ€™ subsidiaries through job creation and other means, the advantages are relatively small compared to the potential economic <b>gains</b> <b>that</b> might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.|$|E
