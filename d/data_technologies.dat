Big <b>Data</b> <b>technology</b> not only enables the integration of diverse information sources, but also supports the management and storage of large data sets. As such, it offers an alternative approach to existing spatial database technology. This paper proposes a design scheme that uses Big <b>Data</b> <b>technology</b> {{as a means to}} store for retrieval large volumes of raster data forming a spatial database of climatic and other environmental data for Mexico...|$|R

30|$|With {{the advent}} of the era of big data, the human ability to {{understand}} and process data has developed to a new stage. Agriculture is not only the source of big data but also a typical field of big data applications [2]. This is the application and practice of big <b>data</b> theory and <b>technology</b> in agriculture. The application of big <b>data</b> <b>technology</b> in agriculture is conducive to achieving a holographic three-dimensional reflection of the agricultural ecosystem. Big <b>data</b> <b>technology</b> helps to improve people’s understanding and insight into the relationships between different things in an agro-ecosystem. With the aid of big <b>data</b> <b>technology,</b> it is also possible to predict the development trend of agriculture and help increase people’s management capabilities.|$|R
