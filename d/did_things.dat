25|$|The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation {{was created}} in 1888 in Montana. It was created from {{what had once been}} a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 {{agreement}} neglected to mention any water rights that were reserved for the reservation in relation to the Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by non-Indian settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation. As non-Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers <b>did</b> <b>things</b> such as build dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the Appropriative water system to support their actions claiming that they had appropriated the water before the American Indians living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use.|$|E
25|$|In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his {{determination}} to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he {{had a sense of}} foreboding about Vietnam—a feeling that no matter what he <b>did</b> <b>things</b> would end badly. Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls. By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam. U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 1941, State Commissar (Reichskommissar) Hinrich Lohse (earlier Gauleiter of Schleswig-Holstein), {{ruler of}} the Baltic lands and Belarus or Ostland as the {{territory}} was called by the invaders– made his guidelines on Jewish question public. Jews, in his opinion, had {{to be used as}} a cheap labour force by paying them minimum wages or by providing them with a minimum food ration– with whatever may be left over after supplying the indigenous Aryan population. In order to govern the Jews they had to be moved to special areas where ghettos would be arranged and they would be forbidden to leave the area. Walter Stahlecker protested against the idea of Hinrich Lohse and demanded that the extermination of the Jews be continued. Berlin, however, passed the power to the civil administration of occupation force and it <b>did</b> <b>things</b> its own way. The area of the Latgale suburbs in Riga was chosen for the Riga Ghetto. It was mainly inhabited by poor people: Jews, Russians and Belarusians. The ghetto bordered on Maskavas, Vitebskas, Ebreju (Jewish), Līksnas, Lauvas, Lazdonas, Lielā Kalnu, Katoļu, Jēkabpils and Lāčplēša Streets. About 7000 non-Jews were moved from there to other flats in Riga. More than 23,000 Riga Jews were ordered to move to the territory of the ghetto. There now were more than 29,000 inmates in the ghetto, including those who had already previously resided there. The Jewish Council was formed within the ghetto, which was assigned the task of regulating social life. The Jewish police force for the maintenance of order formed there. It consisted of 80 men armed with sticks and rubber truncheons. The ghetto was enclosed by a barbed-wire fence. Wooden barriers (logs) were placed on the main streets at the entrance, and the Latvian police were stationed as guards there. Jews were allowed to leave the ghetto only in work columns and in the accompaniment of guards. Individual Jewish specialists could come and go by displaying a special yellow ID. Leaving independently was severely punished.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Jennings {{recalled}} the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: [...] "They wouldn't {{let you do}} anything.

Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{introduced}} {{the first two}} of his many characters during The Raleigh Cigarette Program's first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper {{was based on a}} Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was similar to the later cartoon character, Bullwinkle; there was enough similarity to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose. The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or [...] "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically <b>did</b> <b>things</b> he was told not to do. [...] "Junior" [...] would say things like, [...] "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, [...] "I dood it!" [...] Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname [...] "Junior" [...] long before it was heard by a radio audience. While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna's. Skelton starred in a 1943 movie of the same name, but did not play [...] "Junior" [...] in the film.|$|E

Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We <b>did</b> <b>things</b> like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

[...] Elliott said that he was [...] "a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically". While she discussed the lyrics with Static, Aaliyah consulted Bud'da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the UK garage scene at the time.|$|E

[...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better than I do...
