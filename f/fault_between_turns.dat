Several research works are being made to efficiently approve existing condition monitoring and fault detection techniques for these systems. The condition monitoring of these systems {{becomes more and more}} important, the main obstacle in this task is the lack of an accurate analytical model to describe a faulty DFIG in the majority of the research tasks. In this paper, we present the monitoring strategy of short-circuit <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> <b>turns</b> of the stator windings and open stator phases in doubly-fed {{induction generator}} by fuzzy logic technique. The stator condition monitoring is diagnosed based on the root mean square values of current magnitude in addition to the knowledge expressed in rules and membership function.

40|$|AbstractTransient overvoltages {{appearing}} at line terminal of power transformer HV windings can cause failure of winding insulation. The failure can be from winding to ground or <b>between</b> <b>turns</b> or sections of winding. In {{most of the}} cases, failure from winding to ground can be detected by changes in the wave shape of surge voltage {{appearing at}} line terminal. However, detection of insulation failure <b>between</b> <b>turns</b> may be difficult due to intricacies involved in identifications of faults. In this paper, simulation investigations carried out on a power transformer model winding for identifying <b>faults</b> <b>between</b> <b>turns</b> of winding has been reported. The power transformer HV winding has been represented by 8 sections, 16 sections and 24 sections. Neutral current waveform has been analyzed for same model winding represented by different number of sections. The values of α (‘α’ value is the square root of total ground capacitance to total series capacitance of winding) considered for windings are 5, 10 and 20. Standard lightning impulse voltage (1. 2 / 50 μs wave shape) have been considered for analysis. Computer simulations {{have been carried out}} using software PSPICE version 10. 0. Neutral current and frequency response analysis methods have been used for identification of faults within sections of transformer model winding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{method of}} {{modeling}} internal turn-to-earth and turn-to-turn faults in distribution transformer {{is discussed in}} this paper. The models are entirely compatible with the Alternative Transients Program(ATP). The simulation of the faults is based on known leakage factors between the various coils of the transformer. These leakage factors are evaluated by using a simple method implemented in this paper. A <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> any <b>turn</b> and earth and <b>between</b> any two <b>turns</b> on either winding of a single-phase transformer can be simulated using this method. In this paper, the terminal behavior of a test transformer is studied through the simulation of a simple system in ATP.

A system has been developed to detect an interlaminar <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> the laminations {{of the magnetic}} cores {{by means of the}} flux injection probe (FIP). Experimental work was carried out to calibrate the measuring system and qualify its accuracy over a wide measurement range. Application of a prototype FIP to quality assessment of transformer laminations was investigated in two stages: 1) inspection of stack of laminations with known interlaminar faults applied by artificial shorts and 2) inspection of stack of laminations with unknown quality. The experimental results show that the developed system is capable of detecting an interlaminar <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> as few as two laminations...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Internal winding faults comprise 70 - 80 % of modem transformer breakdown. In this era of deregulation, this phenomenon is likely to increase since loading transformers to their optimum capacity is becoming normal practice. These internal faults result from degradation of the transformer winding insulation, which tends to cause a breakdown in the dielectric strength. This breakdown either causes adjacent windings to short or a winding to be shorted to a grounded part of the transformer. Such faults can be very catastrophic and hence expensive. Utilities therefore welcome inexpensive methods employed to detect such faults in the incipient stage. The long-term objective of this research is the development of an inexpensive technique for the detection of transformer incipient winding faults. As part of this research, the thesis presents: 1. Internal winding models of single-phase, distribution transformers. These models are adapted from an earlier work of modeling internal winding faults of three-phase power transformers. They are compatible with the Alternative Transients Program and enable the transformer winding terminal parameters to be monitored. They allow the simulation of <b>faults</b> <b>between</b> any <b>turn</b> and the earth or <b>between</b> any two <b>turns</b> of the transformer windings. 2. Simulation of various internal winding faults of a single-phase distribution transformer using the models. 3. A general methodology to experimentally verify simulation models for distribution transformer internal winding faults including details of the design and layout of a field experimental setup containing a 25 kVA, 7200 V/ 240 V/ 120 V single-phase, custom-built transformer and a 25 kW resistor load bank. 4. A comparison of the simulation and corresponding field experiment results. Although the simulation models neglected factors such as saturation and consequently transformer nonlinearities, the simulation and field results were very similar. As a contribution, the experimental setup presented in this work could generally be used for simulation model verification by following the proposed methodology with appropriate modifications. The validated models can be utilized to generate fault data for all kinds of scenarios including those that would be impossible to stage experimentally due to high levels of fault currents. These data {{can be used as a}} basis for a single-phase transformer incipient fault detection system...|$|R
