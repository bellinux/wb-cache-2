25|$|An {{important}} change in neoclassical economics occurred around 1933. Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, with the near simultaneous publication {{of their respective}} books, The Economics of <b>Imperfect</b> <b>Competition</b> (1933) and The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933), introduced models of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition.</b> Theories of market forms and industrial organization grew out of this work. They also emphasized certain tools, such as the marginal revenue curve.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} the 1960s, {{macroeconomics}} has been characterized by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition.</b> This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.|$|E
25|$|In {{an economy}} with money, the {{marginal}} utility of a quantity {{is simply that}} of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining supply and demand, as well as essential aspects of models of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
40|$|Operating {{in markets}} {{which include the}} {{characteristics}} of both the perfect and <b>imperfect</b> <b>competitions</b> has never been so easy for a firm, while setting an acceptable price. Various firms show various pricing behavior to generate and maximize revenues. This paper {{is an attempt to}} encompass pricing behaviors of firms when consumers have imperfect recall for the past prices of the products, while giving a thought to ponder that which of the behaviors has an optimal rationale when a firm sets market price for a commodity. The findings concludes that firms set prices as similar as monopolist when the consumers of their products have imperfect recall for price they offered already in yore. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a payment}} card {{association}} such as Visa, {{each time a}} consumer pays by card, {{the bank of the}} merchant (acquirer) pays an interchange fee (IF) to the bank of the cardholder (issuer) to carry on the transaction. This paper studies the determinants of socially and privately optimal IFs in a card scheme where services are provided by a monopoly issuer and perfectly competitive acquirers. We develop a framework that distinguishes card membership from card usage (transaction) decisions (and fees). In doing so, we reveal the implications of a structural asymmetry between consumers and merchants: the card usage decision at a point of sale is ultimately delegated to cardholders. Merchants are not allowed to turn down cards once affiliated with a card network. We show that this asymmetry induces the card association to set a too high IF creating scope scope for regulatory interventions, e. g., caps on IFs. These qualitative results are robust to <b>imperfect</b> issuer <b>competition,</b> <b>imperfect</b> acquirer <b>competition,</b> and to other factors affecting final demands, such as elastic consumer participation or strategic card acceptance to attract customers...|$|R

25|$|Excess Capacity: Under <b>Imperfect</b> <b>competition,</b> the {{installed}} capacity of every firm is large, but not fully utilized. Total output is, therefore, {{less than the}} output which is socially desirable. Since production capacity is not fully utilized, the resources lie idle. Therefore, the production under monopolistic competition is below the full capacity level.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is occasionally referred as orthodox economics whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition,</b> and the neoclassical model {{of economic growth}} for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.|$|E
25|$|Other topics include <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> in macroeconomics, nominal rigidity. Most of {{his work}} is New Keynesian.

30|$|Extending {{literature}} on bank capital and franchise value, Repullo (2004) presented a dynamic model of <b>imperfect</b> market <b>competition</b> in banking industry {{and show that}} reduction in intermediation margins results in lower franchise value, {{and in the absence}} of regulations, exists a gambling equilibrium. In this situation, flat rate equilibrium requirements or binding deposit rate ceiling can ensure the existence of prudent equilibrium. The study concluded that risk-based capital requirements are always effective for preventing banks from excessive risk taking.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that {{under conditions of}} <b>imperfect</b> (oligopolistic) <b>competition,</b> a transition from separate accounting (SA) to formula apportionment (FA) does not eliminate the problem of pro…t shifting via transfer pricing.

40|$|In {{a simple}} {{temporary}} general equilibrium model, it is shown that, {{if the number}} of firms is small, <b>imperfect</b> price <b>competition</b> in the markets for goods may be responsible for the existence of unemployment at any given positive wage. In our examples involving two firms facing their "true" demand curves, total monopolistic labor demand remains bounded as the wage rate goes to zero, and unemployment prevails for a sufficiently large inelastic labor supply. In the competitive case total labor demand would go to infinity and intersect labor supply at a positive wage...|$|R
25|$|Joan Robinson's work on <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition,</b> at least, was a {{response}} to certain problems of Marshallian partial equilibrium theory highlighted by Piero Sraffa. Anglo-American economists also responded to these problems by turning towards general equilibrium theory, developed on the European continent by Walras and Vilfredo Pareto. J. R. Hicks's Value and Capital (1939) was influential in introducing his English-speaking colleagues to these traditions. He, in turn, was influenced by the Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek's move to the London School of Economics, where Hicks then studied.|$|E
500|$|From a {{macroeconomic}} perspective, the PPF {{illustrates the}} production possibilities {{available to a}} nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis. [...] However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) {{may lead to the}} wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.|$|E
2500|$|New Keynesian Macreconomics. Dixon {{was one of}} {{the first}} economists to examine the effect of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> on the {{effectiveness}} of fiscal policy in his paper A simple model of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> with Walrasian features. This is an idea that was much explored in many other papers by him [...] and more recently. This paper was the first to demonstrate in a simple general equilibrium model that the fiscal multiplier could be increasing with the degree of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> in the output market. The reason for this is that <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> in the output market tends to reduce the real wage, leading to the household substituting away from consumption towards leisure. When government spending is increased, the corresponding increase in lump-sum taxation causes both leisure and consumption decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> in the output market, the lower the real wage and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption. Hence the fiscal multiplier is less than one, but increasing in the degree of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> in the output market.|$|E

30|$|The {{nature of}} {{transnational}} crime syndicates [17] however, influences all three strategic actions. Poachers conflict with anti-poaching units; end-user suppliers come {{in conflict with}} demand reductionists particularly if campaigns are culturally insensitive; and syndicate supply chains compete with potential legal suppliers. For instance, when suppliers like transnational crime syndicates, have lower costs compared to legal producers and suppliers, <b>imperfect</b> economic <b>competition</b> results [7, 18]. This nearly always leads to illegal suppliers outcompeting legal ones [19]. The disruption and even collapse of transnational crime may thus serve a key strategic contribution {{to the success of}} any of the potential actions available.|$|R

We demonstrate that in equilibrium the suggestion will either be undercut or complied with by the retailers, but never surpassed: undercutting occurs if competition is fierce, the impact from consumers affected by reference-dependent preferences is significant, and high price suggestions are credible; compliance occurs otherwise. We provide comparisons, and discuss implications, for consumer surplus for the scenarios with suggested retail prices, without vertical restraints and with resale price maintenance...|$|R
2500|$|Monopolistic {{competition}} {{is a type}} of <b>imperfect</b> <b>competition</b> such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. In the presence of coercive government, monopolistic competition will fall into government-granted monopoly. Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity. Models of monopolistic competition are often used to model industries. Textbook examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities. The [...] "founding father" [...] of the theory of monopolistic {{competition is}} Edward Hastings Chamberlin, who wrote a pioneering book on the subject, Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933).

40|$|This Paper {{develops}} {{an argument}} explaining why retail prices may rise {{in response to}} the deregulation of opening hours. We make this point in a model of <b>imperfect</b> duopolistic <b>competition.</b> In a deregulated market retailers view the choice of opening hours as a means to increase the degree of perceived product differentiation thus relaxing price competition. If the opportunity costs of the time spent on shopping are sufficiently high the equilibrium configuration has asymmetric shopping hours where one retailer stays open for longer than the other does. Both retailers charge higher prices than under regulation, and both are strictly better off. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of <b>imperfect</b> price <b>competition</b> where not all firms can sell to all consumers. A network {{structure}} models the local interaction of firms and consumers. We find that aggregate surplus is maximized with a fully connected network, which corresponds to perfect competition, and decreases monotonically as the network becomes less connected until firms become local monopolists. When we study which networks are likely to form in equilibrium, we find that stable networks are not fully connected but are connected enough to rule out local monopolists. Our results extend to oligopolistic competition when consumers can either buy from a single firm or from all firms.
