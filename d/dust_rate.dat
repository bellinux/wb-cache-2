40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} interstellar dust in the Universe by means of chemical evolution models of galaxies of different morphological types, reproducing the main observed features of present day galaxies. We adopt the most updated prescriptions for dust production from supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars {{as well as for}} dust accretion and destruction processes. Then, we study the cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>rate</b> in the framework of three different cosmological scenarios for galaxy formation: i) a pure luminosity scenario (PLE), ii) a number density evolution scenario (DE), as suggested by the classical hierarchical clustering scenario and iii) an alternative scenario, in which both spirals and ellipticals are allowed to evolve in number on an observationally motivated basis. Our results give predictions about the evolution of the dust content in different galaxies as well as the cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>rate</b> as a function of redshift. Concerning the cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>rate,</b> the best scenario is the alternative one, which predicts a peak at 2 < z < 3 and reproduces the cosmic star formation rate. We compute the evolution of the comoving dust density parameter Ω dust and find agreement with data for z < 0. 5 in the framework of DE and alternative scenarios. Finally, the evolution of the average cosmic metallicity is presented and it shows a quite fast increase in each scenario, reaching the solar value at the present time, although most of the heavy elements are incorporated into solid grains, and therefore not observable in the gas phase.

By comparing predictions with abundance data, we were able to constrain nature and age of GRB hosts. We also computed a theoretical cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>rate,</b> including stellar dust production, accretion and destruction, under the hypotheses of pure luminosity evolution and strong number density evolution of galaxies. We suggest that one of the three GRB hosts is a massive protospheroid caught during its formation, while for the other two the situation is more uncertain, although one could perhaps be a spheroid and the other a spiral galaxy. We estimated the chemical ages of the host galaxies which vary from 15 to 320 Myr. Concerning the cosmic effective dust production rate in a unitary volume of the Universe, our results show {{that in the case of}} pure luminosity evolution there is a first peak between redshift z = 8 and 9 and another at z similar to 5, whereas in the case of strong number density evolution, it increases slightly from z = 10 to z similar to 2 and then it decreases down to z = 0. Finally, we found that the total cosmic dust mass density at the present time is Omega(dust) similar to 3. 5 x 10 (- 5) in the case of pure luminosity evolution, and Omega(dust) similar to 7 x 10 (- 5) in the case of number density evolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{southern}} {{polar cap}} of Mars, known as Planum Australe, is a 1. 6 x 106 km 3 ice sheet made of water ice with a 0 to 15 % <b>dust</b> <b>rate.</b> It is structured of isochrone layers deposited over several {{hundreds of millions}} of years, and reaching 3700 m of maximum thickness. Those features make the cap comparable to the continental ice sheets on Earth. However, low surface temperatures (155 K), weak atmospheric pressure (0. 008 bars) and other typical Martian parameters could make the ice to have mechanical and dynamic behaviors, at any scales, somewhat different to those known under terrestrial conditions. Such behaviors remain to be detected. Unusual ice scarps are observed over a well defined region of Planum Australe. They have a 500 m average height and a typical length of about 30 km. Their particular size and shape are unknown neither on the northern Martian cap nor on the Earth. So far few studies, based on analysis of low resolution images, suggested a wind formation process.

40|$|Studies of {{submicron}} dust using Mie scattering from Nd:YAG lasers {{and video}} data of micron to sub-millimeter sized dust on DIII-D tokamak {{have provided the}} first data of dust sources and transport during tokamak discharges. During normal operation on DIII-D dust observation rates are low, a few events per discharge or less. The net carbon content of the dust corresponds to a carbon atom density a few orders of magnitude below the core impurity density. Statistical analysis of Mie data collected over months of operation reveal correlation of increased <b>dust</b> <b>rate</b> with increased heating power and impulsive wall loading due to edge localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions. Generation of significant amounts of dust by disruptions is confirmed by the camera data. However, dust production by disruptions alone is insufficient to account for estimated in-vessel dust inventory in DIII-D. After an extended entry vent, thousands of dust particles are observed by cameras in the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges. Individual particles moving at velocities up to {approx} 300 m/s, breakup of larger particles into pieces, and collisions of particles with walls are observed. After {approx} 70 discharges, dust levels are reduced to a few events per discharge. In order to calibrate diagnostics and benchmark modeling, milligram amounts of micron-sized carbon dust have been injected into DIII-D discharges, leading to the core carbon density increase {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. Following injection, dust trajectories in the divertor are mostly in the toroidal direction, consistent with the ion drag force.

40|$|Copper {{is thought}} to be noncatalytic to carbon {{deposition}} from gas atmospheres, and owing to its extremely low solubility for carbon, inert to the metal dusting reaction. Thus, the addition of copper to nickel, which forms a near perfect solid solution, may be able to suppress or greatly retard the metal dusting of the alloy, without the need for a protective oxide scale on the surface. The dusting behaviour of Ni-Cu alloys containing up to 50 wt% Cu, along with pure Cu, was investigated in a 68 %CO- 31 %H 2 - 1 %H 2 O gas mixture (a C : 19) at 680 °C for up to 150 h. Surface analysis showed that two types of carbon deposits, graphite particle clusters and filaments, were observed on pure Ni and Ni-Cu alloys with Cu contents of up to 5 wt%. Alloys with more than 10 wt% Cu showed very little coking, forming filaments only. SEM and TEM analyses revealed metal particles encapsulated by graphite shells within the graphite particle clusters, and metal particles at filament tips or embedded along their lengths. A kinetic investigation showed that alloy <b>dusting</b> <b>rates</b> decreased significantly with increasing copper levels up to 10 wt%.

40|$|Abstract. Dusting of iron {{results from}} partial {{disintegration}} of a cementite scale which grows {{on the metal}} surface during reaction with carbon-supersaturated gas. Scaling kinetics are shown {{to be consistent with}} diffusion of carbon through the cementite. Further diffusion of carbon into the iron supersaturates it to a very high degree. Dusting of nickel and austenitic alloys leads to no carbide formation. Instead graphite grows into the metal, supported by diffusion of dissolved carbon to growth sites. Variations in rate with alloy iron content reflect the known effects of iron on carbon solubility and diffusivity. Alloying with copper also changes coking and <b>dusting</b> <b>rates,</b> although copper does not affect carbon permeability. The effect is shown to be due to interaction of copper with graphite nucleation sites...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{evidence for}} atmospheric dust deposition {{prior to the}} Quaternary, quantitative rate data remains sparse. As dust influences both climate and biological productivity, the absence of quantitative dust data limits the comprehensiveness of models of pre-Quaternary climate and biogeochemical cycles. Here, we propose that inorganic matter contained in coal primarily records atmospheric dust deposition. To test this, we use the average concentration of inorganic matter in Permian coal to map global patterns and deposition <b>rates</b> of atmospheric <b>dust</b> over Pangea. The <b>dust</b> accumulation <b>rate</b> is calculated assuming Permian peat carbon accumulation rates in temperate climates were similar to Holocene rates and accounting {{for the loss of}} carbon during coalification. Coal-derived rates vary from 0. 02 to 25 g m− 2 year− 1, values that fall within the present-day global range. A well-constrained East–West pattern of dust deposition corresponding to expected palaeoclimate gradients extends across Gondwana with maximum <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates</b> occurring close to arid regions. A similar pattern is partially defined over the northern hemisphere. Patterns are consistent with the presence of two large global dust plumes centred on the tropics. The spatial patterns of dust deposition were also compared to dust cycle simulations for the Permian made with the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM 3). Key differences between the simulations and the coal data are the lack of evidence for an Antarctic dust source, higher than expected dust deposition over N and S China and greater <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates</b> over Western Gondwana. This new coal-based <b>dust</b> accumulation <b>rate</b> data expands the pre-Neogene quantitative record of atmospheric dust and can help to inform and validate models of global circulation and biogeochemical cycles over the past 350 Myr...|$|R
40|$|The nature, composition, abundance, {{and size}} {{distribution}} of dust in galaxies {{is determined by}} the rate at which it is created in the different stellar sources and destroyed by interstellar shocks. Because of their extensive wavelength coverage, proximity, and nearly face-on geometry, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) provide a unique opportunity to study these processes in great detail. In this paper we use the complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the MCs to calculate the lifetime and destruction efficiencies of silicate and carbon dust in these galaxies. We find dust lifetimes of 22 +- 13 Myr (30 +- 17 Myr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the LMC, and 54 +- 32 Myr (72 +- 43 Myr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the SMC. The significantly shorter lifetimes in the MCs, as compared to the Milky Way, are explained as the combined effect of their lower total dust mass, {{and the fact that the}} dust-destroying isolated SNe in the MCs seem to be preferentially occurring in regions with higher than average dust-to-gas (D 2 G) mass ratios. We also calculate the supernova rate and the current star formation rate in the MCs, and use them to derive maximum <b>dust</b> injection <b>rates</b> by asymptotic giant branch stars and core collapse supernovae. We find that the injection rates are an order of magnitude lower than the <b>dust</b> destruction <b>rates</b> by the SNRs. This supports the conclusion that, unless the <b>dust</b> destruction <b>rates</b> have been considerably overestimated, most of the dust must be reconstituted from surviving grains in dense molecular clouds. More generally, we also discuss the dependence of the <b>dust</b> destruction <b>rate</b> on the local D 2 G mass ratio, the ambient gas density and metallicity, as well as the application of our results to other galaxies and dust evolution models.

40|$|Chemical {{weathering}} influences many {{components of}} the Earth system, from nutrient supply to landscape evolution to long-term climate. Despite considerable advances in understanding what controls chemical weathering in theoretical models and laboratory experiments, {{there is still much}} uncertainty surrounding the controls of chemical weathering in nature. Here I present several studies on chemical erosion rates in steep, eroding terrain. In Chapter 2, I present a 1 -D numerical model for the evolution of soil mineralogy on an eroding hillslope, to quantify how much fluctuations in physical erosion rates should affect soil composition and thus estimates of chemical erosion rates inferred from soil composition. In Chapter 3, I combine new measurements of mineral abundances in soil, saprolite, and bedrock with prior measurements of soil production <b>rates,</b> <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates,</b> and chemical composition in soil, saprolite, bedrock, and dust at an intensely weathered site in Puerto Rico. These data suggest this suite of measurements can — for abundant, soluble mineral phases — produce estimates of long-term mineral-specific weathering rates with uncertainties smaller than 20 % of the mean. Lastly, I discuss new measurements of soil production rates and rock and soil composition along two steep altitudinal (and hence climatic) transects in the Idaho Batholith. In Chapter 4, I show how these data may be combined with measurements of dust composition to quantify long-term <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates.</b> Under the assumption that mafic-rich dust from the nearby Palouse loess has been mixed into the otherwise granitic Idaho soils, I calculate <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates</b> of 3 - 13 t km - 2 yr - 1 at our field sites, consistent with modern <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rates</b> measured elsewhere in the western United States. In Chapter 5, I show that mean annual soil temperature exerts no discernible effect on chemical erosion rates or on the degree of chemical weathering across these Idaho field sites. These measurements also show that the degree of chemical weathering, but not the rate of chemical erosion, increases with (a) the annual duration of wet conditions in the soil, and (b) soil residence time.

Several dust schemes have been proposed. In this talk, I will first review the schemes. Scheme-I: F {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the power of friction velocity. An empirical PSD is imposed on F to obtain <b>dust</b> emission <b>rates</b> for different particle sizes. The scheme can be formulated as follows: F = αg(un ∗ − un∗t) (1) Fj = P (dj) F (2) where u ∗ is friction velocity, u∗t is threshold friction velocity, Fj is the <b>dust</b> emission <b>rate</b> and P (dj) the dust mass fraction of the jth particle-size bin. The coefficient αg is empirical, in which various factors are lumped together. The F ∝ un ∗ relationship is first proposed by Gillette and Passi (1988). Field observations suggest n falls mostly between 3 and 5, but is often set to 4. The scheme is popular due to its simplicity. However, it is not simple to estimate αg. If we set n = 4, then the dimensions of αg are [M L− 6 T 3], suggesting that αg is affected by a number of factors. There is confusion with regards to the interpretation of u∗t. Equation 2 requires the specification of P (dj) which is unknown. Scheme-II: Following Zender et al. (2003), the dust-emission rate for the jth particle-size bin, Fj is parameterized a...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} dust release from aggregative {{cohesive}} powders under {{the action of}} mechanical vibration is studied. Beds of cohesive Potato Starch and Silica powders at fixed heights were vertically vibrated in a column in which vibration, frequency and acceleration levels can be independently set. Acceleration was changed with acceleration gravity ratio (a/g) values ranging between 5 and 9, while frequencies were set at 70 and 120 Hz. Vertical air flow rates through the bed were used to simulate air entrainment. Air in the head space above the bed was extracted and filtered in order to quantify the released <b>dust</b> <b>rates.</b> Results of these experiments are discussed and analyzed with reference to both the aggregative behavior of these powders and the inter-particle forces estimated from the bulk flow properties measured with conventional and standardized powder flow testers. A good relationship is found between the natural tendency of these powders to generate aggregates, the inter-particle forces and applied acceleration levels. Better insight of the physics is required to understand the effect of frequency on the dustiness of these powders...|$|R
40|$|Spherical {{accretion}} of {{dust and}} gas onto a gravitating object is examined {{under the influence of}} central radiation. We found that, as long as the central luminosity is less than the Eddington one for dust, the gas flow is almost Bondi type, while the dust flow is greatly affected by central radiation. For non-luminous sources, in the outer region where the gravity on the dust is balanced by the drag force, the infall velocity of dust is generally larger than the gas velocity. Both gas and dust freefall in the inner region. As the dust-to-gas ratio increases, the gas accretion rate slightly decreases, while the <b>dust</b> accretion <b>rate</b> increases. As a result, the total accretion rate increases. When the central luminosity is considered, the infall velocity of dust becomes smaller and smaller, as the central luminosity increases. Although the gas accretion rate slightly increases with luminosity, the <b>dust</b> accretion <b>rate</b> linearly decreases due to the radiation pressure. As a result, the total accretion rate decreases with luminosity. Approximate expressions for dust and gas accretion rates were obtained...|$|R
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The <b>dust</b> production <b>rate</b> {{of the comet}} was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{deposition}} of dust on photovoltaic modules is of importance as parameter for economic analysis and life cycle assessments to evaluate this kind of technology for generation of electricity. Even though {{during the last two}} decades several photovoltaic plants were implemented, only a few studies about this issue were performed. This work tries to estimate the annual loss of generated energy caused by dust deposition on PV modules based on an experimental setup of a grid connected PV plant, monitoring of solar irradiation, onsite determination of <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rate,</b> and processing climatic data to obtain information about the frequency of rainfall occurrence. In Mexico City, air pollution with suspended particulate matter with diameter below 10 μm (PM 10) is almost permanently over 50 μg m- 3. This contamination contributed to an average <b>dust</b> deposition <b>rate</b> of 65 g m- 2 d- 1 on horizontal surfaces. Dust accumulation during rainless periods of more than 60 days can reduce production of PV systems up to 15 %. With the capacity of natural cleaning by rainfalls, annual loss of production is estimated to be 3. 6 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present {{infrared}} imaging and photometry of the bright, giant comet C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale– Bopp). The comet {{was observed in}} an extended infrared and optical observing campaign in 1996 – 1997. The infrared morphology of the comet was observed to change from the 6 to 8 jet “porcupine” structure in 1996 to the “pinwheel ” structure seen in 1997; this has implications for {{the position of the}} rotational angular momentum vector. Long term light curves taken at 11. 3 m indicate a <b>dust</b> production <b>rate</b> that varies with heliocentric distance as r 1 : 4. Short term light curves taken at perihelion indicate a rotational periodicity of 11. 3 hours and a projected dust outflow speed of 0 : 4 km s 1. The spectral energy distribution of the dust on October 31, 1996 is well modeled by a mixture of 70 % silicaceous and 30 % carbonaceous non-porous grains, with a small particle dominated size distribution like that seen for comet P/Halley (McDonnell et al., 1991), an overall <b>dust</b> production <b>rate</b> of 2 105 kg s 1, a dust-to-gas ratio of 5, and an albedo of 39 %...|$|R
