5|$|<b>Epidermal</b> nevi, neoplasms, and cysts are skin lesions {{that develop}} from the <b>epidermal</b> {{layer of the}} skin.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed <b>epidermal</b> projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. <b>Epidermal</b> thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. <b>Epidermal</b> skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|Some dragonflies, such as {{the green}} darner, Anax junius, have a noniridescent blue which is {{produced}} structurally by scatter from arrays of tiny spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of <b>epidermal</b> cells underneath the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{has been}} shown to inhibit sensory {{irritation}} when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium {{has been shown}} to accelerate the recovery rate of the <b>epidermal</b> permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|E
5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an <b>epidermal</b> invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|For {{lung cancer}} cases that develop {{resistance}} to <b>epidermal</b> growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, new drugs are in development. New EGFR inhibitors include afatinib and dacomitinib. An alternative signaling pathway, c-Met, can be inhibited by tivantinib and onartuzumab. New ALK inhibitors include crizotinib and ceritinib.|$|E
5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the <b>epidermal</b> growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It may be useful in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>epidermal</b> {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR {{are common in}} non-small-cell lung carcinoma and {{provide the basis for}} treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Rhytismataceae. A {{widespread}} species, particularly in temperate areas, it colonizes the dead fallen leaves of vascular plants, particularly oak and chestnut. The fungus apothecia, which form in the <b>epidermal</b> layer of the leaf host, resemble dark hexagonal spots scattered on a multi-colored mosaic pattern bounded by thin black lines. When mature, the apothecia open by triangular flaps to release spores. The anamorph form of C.dentatus is Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. Lookalike species can be distinguished by {{the shape of the}} apothecia, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are <b>epidermal</b> growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from <b>epidermal</b> scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant <b>epidermal</b> and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each <b>epidermal</b> cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent <b>epidermal</b> layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
25|$|Apolysisâ€”moulting hormones are {{released}} into the haemolymph and the old cuticle separates from the underlying <b>epidermal</b> cells. The epidermis increases in size due to mitosis and then the new cuticle is produced. Enzymes secreted by the <b>epidermal</b> cells digest the old endocuticle, not affecting the old sclerotised exocuticle.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy of {{the skin}} sample {{obtained}} from the biopsy is used to detect the presence of cleavage within the dermis, <b>epidermal</b> acantholysis (breaking apart {{of the skin}}), dyskeratotic keratinocytes and vacuolar changes in the layers of the skin, interfacial dermatitis, and <b>epidermal</b> exocytosis. Presentation of these characteristics suggests PNP.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for ecdysis, the arthropod becomes inactive {{for a period}} of time, undergoing apolysis or separation of the old exoskeleton from the underlying <b>epidermal</b> cells. For most organisms, the resting period is a stage of preparation during which the secretion of fluid from the moulting glands of the <b>epidermal</b> layer and the loosening of the underpart of the cuticle occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} {{penetration}} differs between species, with some being superficially confined to the epidermis (such as in Eucalyptus and Alnus), whereas in other cases the hyphae extend to the cortical cells or to the endodermis (as {{is the case in}} most gymnosperms). In many <b>epidermal</b> types, radial elongation of <b>epidermal</b> cells occurs. However, this is largely absent in the cortical type, suggesting different strategies of increasing surface contact among species.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies to <b>epidermal</b> {{transglutaminase}} (eTG, also keratinocyte transglutaminase) are the autoantibodies {{believed to}} cause dermatitis herpetiformis.|$|E
25|$|Guard {{cells have}} more chloroplasts {{than the other}} <b>epidermal</b> cells from which guard cells are derived. Their {{function}} is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{dust mite}} {{infestation}} {{in the home}} {{has been linked to}} atopic dermatitis and <b>epidermal</b> barrier damage has been documented.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most <b>epidermal</b> cells, {{the guard}} cells of plant stomata contain {{relatively}} well-developed chloroplasts. However, {{exactly what they}} do is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Bullous Pemphigoid, Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Drug Eruptions. Epidermolysis Bullosa, Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, Erythema Multiforme, Lichen Planus, {{pemphigus}} vulgaris, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic <b>Epidermal</b> Necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Skin reactions: Rash, pruritus, and {{photosensitivity}} {{have all}} been noticed. Toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 mediates ubiquitination and {{subsequent}} down-regulation of {{components of the}} <b>epidermal</b> growth factor (EGF) signalling pathway, such as HER3 and HER4 EGF receptors, and ACK.|$|E
25|$|Side-effects such as rash, fever, {{and fatigue}} are very serious, {{as they may}} {{indicate}} incipient Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome, toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis, DRESS syndrome or aseptic meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis, {{erythema}} multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|All eczemas are {{characterized}} by spongiosis which allows inflammatory mediators to accumulate. Different dendritic cells subtypes, such as Langerhans cells, inflammatory dendritic <b>epidermal</b> cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells {{have a role to}} play.|$|E
25|$|Poot et al. 2013 {{determined}} that immunoprecipitation for antibodies against envoplakin and periplakin or alpha2-macroglobulin-likeâ€“1 {{is the most}} sensitive test. However, alpha2-macroglobulin-like-1 can also be detected in patients with toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{nevirapine}} {{is the development}} of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome, toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis and hypersensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Dangerous and {{potentially}} fatal skin reactions, including Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome and toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis, caused by carbamazepine therapy are significantly {{more common in}} people with a particular human leukocyte antigen allele, HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios {{for the development of}} Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic <b>epidermal</b> necrolysis in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele {{has been shown to be}} a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine among Japanese and Europeans.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{mechanism}} for how tumors {{are able to}} induce autoantibodies toward the plakin proteins is unknown. Suggested theories include tumor production of plakin proteins which initiate an autoimmune response against them, and cross-reactivity of tumor antigens and <b>epidermal</b> antigens.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} major <b>epidermal</b> cell types which all {{ultimately}} {{derive from the}} outermost (L1) tissue layer of the shoot apical meristem, called protodermal cells: trichomes, pavement cells and guard cells, {{all of which are}} arranged in a non-random fashion.|$|E
25|$|The Center of {{molecular}} immunology (CIM) developed nimotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody {{used to treat}} cancer. Nimotuzumab is an inhibitor of <b>epidermal</b> growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is over-expressed in many cancers. Nimotuzumab is now being developed with international partners.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of laser resection of the labia minora involves the de-epithelialization of the labia. The technical disadvantage of laser labiaplasty is that the removal of excess labial epidermis risks causing the occurrence of <b>epidermal</b> inclusion cysts.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, {{and more}} specifically, retinoic acid, appears to {{maintain}} normal skin health by switching on genes and differentiating keratinocytes (immature skin cells) into mature <b>epidermal</b> cells. Exact mechanisms behind pharmacological retinoid therapy {{agents in the}} treatment of dermatological diseases are being researched.|$|E
