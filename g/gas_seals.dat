40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double <b>seals</b> with a <b>gas</b> buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double <b>gas</b> buffered <b>sealing</b> system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> device. The double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to process and the inside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional <b>gas</b> <b>seal.</b> The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> face. With the configuration described, the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R

50|$|Starting from 1996 the Dutch oil and {{gas company}} NAM {{installed}} {{over a period of}} 10 years 20 large E-motor driven (with variable speed drive) gas compressors of 23 MW fully equipped with active magnetic bearings on both the E-motor and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the active magnetic bearings were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha Bearings.) By using active magnetic bearings and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without the gearbox in between) and applying dry <b>gas</b> <b>seals,</b> a full dry-dry (oil free) system has been installed. Applying active magnetic bearings in the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration with a gearbox, plain bearings and a gasturbine-driver) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies (particularly at partial load). As done in the Groningen field, the full installation can additionally be placed outdoors without the need for a large compressor building.|$|E
