25|$|In any {{dimension}} higher than three, the algorithmic Steinitz problem (given a lattice, {{determine whether it}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> lattice of a convex polytope) is complete for the existential theory of the reals by Richter-Gebert's universality theorem. However, because a given graph may correspond {{to more than one}} face lattice, it is difficult to extend this completeness result to the problem of recognizing the graphs of 4-polytopes, and this problem's complexity remains open.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "Ellis Paul {{is one of}} the best singer/songwriters of his generation.

He has spun his story songs for nearly twenty years now, and has eleven studio recordings (with an additional two early recordings on cassette—now available on CD) to his credit. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene who is better-loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states that}} when fans {{ask him if}} Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he {{believes}} he is and states that he and Davies hold {{it to be true}} [...] "in [...] little world"; the link is [...] "unconfirmed" [...] within the text of the show. As to how Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, [...] "Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information" [...] which he feels is a [...] "wonderful twist of events". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> of Boe, stating [...] "the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.|$|E
