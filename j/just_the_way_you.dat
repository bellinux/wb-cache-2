2500|$|The Jack Benny Show had {{previously}} included a Jewish-accented character, [...] "Shlepperman [...] ", played by Sam Hearn, {{but it was}} discontinued in the late 1930s. In 1946 Auerbach {{was hired as a}} [...] permanent, although only occasional, character, Mr. Kitzel (sometimes spelled [...] "Kitzle [...] "). In January he made his first appearance as a hot dog vendor at the Rose Bowl game Jack was attending. His appearance went over so well with the audience and Benny himself that he returned the next week. As the hot dog vendor he became famous for the catch phrase [...] "The pickle in the middle with the mustard on top." [...] In 1946 this catch phrase was turned into a novelty song, written by Jack Benny Show writer John Tackaberry and songwriter Carl Sigman, featuring Auerbach as the singer. With the lyrics [...] "The pickle in the middle with the mustard on top. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> like them and they're all red hot.", the song became popular in the late 1940s. The song led to his being named Man of the Year by the National Pickle Packers Association. His other catch phrase was the exclamation [...] "hoo hoo, hooo! [...] " [...] usually delivered {{in response to a question}} from Jack. Auerbach's Mr. Kitzel was unique among the characters on the show as being the only one not to treat Jack disparagingly.
