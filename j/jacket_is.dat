5|$|Take Off Your Pants and <b>Jacket</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, {{the album was}} {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
5|$|The green <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> {{only allowed}} {{to be removed from}} Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always {{followed}} the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedreña, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.|$|E
50|$|In November 2007, a Dead 60s {{limited edition}} Fred Perry Harrington <b>Jacket</b> <b>was</b> launched. Designed with {{input from the}} band, the <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> a {{reversed}} Harrington jacket available in 2 colours: Cornish Tartan and Stuart Tartan. Only 500 of each design <b>were</b> made. Each <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> individually numbered and came with a Dead 60s neck label.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{turbulent}} 10-year history the gold <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> officially retired after the 2010 premiership win. The <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> auctioned on eBay for $3,900, with all proceeds {{going to the}} Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria.|$|R
5000|$|The {{imperial}} yellow <b>jacket</b> (...) <b>was</b> {{a symbol}} of high honour during China's Qing Dynasty. As yellow was a forbidden color, representing the Emperor, the <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> given only to high-ranking officials and to the Emperor's body guards.|$|R
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> on the ground.|$|E

50|$|The Crown {{said the}} brown <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> dry cleaned {{to cover up}} the murder. The Defence said the <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> laundered by the wife because the Olands had visitation and {{funerals}} to attend, since Dennis's father was deceased.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, the Western Cartridge Company {{introduced}} a copper-washed bullet jacketing called Lubaloy {{which stands for}} lubricating alloy. Lubaloy replaced standard bullet <b>jacketing</b> which had <b>been</b> cupro-nickel coated steel or solid cupro-nickel. The original <b>jacketing</b> <b>was</b> found to be detrimental to firearm performance over time. Lumps of the hot <b>jacketing</b> <b>were</b> deposited {{near the end of}} the barrel during firing, eventually creating a hazard or destroying the barrel. The Lubaloy-Palma ammunition <b>jacketing</b> <b>was</b> a breakthrough solution to this persistent dilemma. It was composed of 90% copper, 8% zinc, and 2% tin.|$|R
30|$|In {{specimens}} J-SJ 1 (Fig.  6), J-SJ 2 (Fig.  7), and J-SJ 3 (Fig.  8), {{the steel}} <b>jackets</b> <b>were</b> prefabricated as plate-shaped (Figs.  6 and 8) and U-shaped panels (Fig.  7), and the steel <b>jackets</b> <b>were</b> then assembled on the column faces after coating with an epoxy adhesive layer. The anchor bolts were then installed through the pre-drilled holes at {{a length of}} 120  mm into the concrete columns. Finally, in specimen J-SJ 3, the free ends of the steel <b>jackets</b> <b>were</b> welded together.|$|R

25|$|The <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> made of 14 {{pieces and}} the pants of 5. As for the shirts, {{patterns}} are matched throughout; {{depending on the}} pattern complexity, the production time is between 7 and 9 hours. Charvet pyjamas are, according to François Simon, a cult object.|$|E
30|$|Patients {{were allowed}} to stand up on {{the second or third}} {{postoperative}} day. Sitting position was authorized after surgery as soon as the patient was pain-free. A fiberglass <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> applied before discharge home. This <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> removed after 8  weeks. No physiotherapy was necessary after surgery.|$|R

25|$|Nehru's {{personal}} {{preference for the}} sherwani ensured that {{it continues to be}} considered formal wear in North India today; aside from lending his name to a kind of cap, the Nehru <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> named in his honour because of his preference for that style.|$|E
25|$|A {{waistcoat}} {{is never}} worn {{with a double}} breasted jacket. Since this style of <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> never unbuttoned, the waist of the trousers is never exposed, and therefore {{does not need to}} be covered, though before World War II an edge of waistcoat was often shown between the jacket and shirt.|$|E
25|$|The {{buttoning}} of the <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> primarily {{determined by}} the button stance, {{a measure of how}} high the buttons are in relation to the natural waist. In some (now unusual) styles where the buttons are placed high, the tailor would have intended the suit to be buttoned differently from the more common lower stance. Nevertheless, some general guidelines are given here.|$|E
50|$|After the show's cancellation, props such as {{pieces of}} Adam's artwork and Joan's {{signature}} messenger bag and costume pieces belonging to cast members were sold on eBay. Grace's trademark leather <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> not included as the <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> {{brought in by}} actress Becky Wahlstrom from her own teenage years.|$|R
50|$|Water <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} in watercooling. They are also used in {{laboratory}} glassware: Liebig, Graham, and Allihn condensers. Water <b>jackets</b> <b>were</b> used to cool the barrels of machine guns {{at the time of}} the First World War, but modern machine guns are air-cooled to conserve weight and hence increase portability.|$|R

During winter a navy blue polartec-fleece jacket or leather <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> worn. Ranks are worn on the shoulders by both NCOs and commissioned ranks.|$|E
25|$|The AP Valves Mk4 Jump <b>Jacket</b> <b>is</b> {{a harness}} with {{integral}} buoyancy jacket {{specifically designed for}} commercial diving work with helmets and bells. There is a direct feed to the jacket from the main air supply, from the pneumo line and from bailout, and a system which allows the diver's pneumo to be directly connected to another diver's helmet as an emergency air supply.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} lifesaving {{services}} were formed that the personal safety of boat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern life <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who created a cork vest in 1854 to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposescompatibility as an additionalvariable or {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to lifesaving performance of life jackets. In order to support the proposal, a model and seven hypotheses were developed based on previous literatures and accidents reports. The hypotheses are compatibility of life jackets with CPV contributes to the lifesaving performance of a life jacket (H 1); Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> not compatible to don inside the fully enclosed spaces of CPV (H 2); Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don in open spaces of CPV (H 3), Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 4), Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the fully enclosed space of CPV (H 5),: Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don in open space of CPV (H 6); and Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 7). Verification of the hypotheses and model was based on opinion fromthree groups of maritime professional. The opinionswere gathered by a survey questionnaire, and the response was using a five-point Likert Scale. The development of the survey questionnaires were according to standards of IMO. The performed analyses were descriptive analysis, variance analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis. Based on the result, the proposed model and hypotheses were supported...|$|R

25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> unlined or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E
25|$|Surviving dust-jackets on {{the first}} edition are {{exceedingly}} rare. It is not known whether that is because of attrition or because some printings were not jacketed or because lots directed to some markets did not come with jackets. What is known is that jackets have been reported {{on more than one}} of the printings and most commonly {{on the first}} printing. The <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> a medium blue field all around. The front announces the title in white, beneath which appears, in color and framed in red, Tolkien's illustration of Hobbiton. The reverse displays Tolkien's illustration of Smaug on his trove, also in color.|$|E
25|$|To be on {{the safe}} side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
5000|$|The Yellow <b>Jacket</b> <b>was</b> also {{released}} in 1994. [...] Yellow <b>Jackets</b> <b>are</b> {{a type of}} adapter that allows the existing power tubes in a guitar amplifier to be replaced with EL84 power tubes without rebiasing the amplifier. In 1994, Guitar World Magazine conducted a test in which Yellow <b>Jackets</b> <b>were</b> installed in a 100-watt Marshall Plexi Reissue. The resulting tones were “similar to those of a Vox AC30” although the amplifier was not as loud {{as it had been}} before the modification. There are several sets of Yellow Jacket tube converters, their designations relate to the type of amplifier they are converting.|$|R
