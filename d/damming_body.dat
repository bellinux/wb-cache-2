40|$|A {{distorted}} physical model, {{based on}} Ürkmez Dam in Izmir, Turkey, {{was built to}} study sudden partial dam break flows. The distorted model had a horizontal scale of 1 / 150 and a vertical scale of 1 / 30, containing <b>dam</b> reservoir, <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> and downstream area-from <b>dam</b> <b>body</b> to Ürkmez urban area until the sea coast. In the model, the reservoir is approximately 12 m 3, the <b>dam</b> <b>body</b> has a width of 2. 84 m and a height of 1. 07 m, and the downstream area is nearly 200 m 2. The Ürkmez Dam was chosen because Ürkmez Town is located right at its downstream area, allowing the study of dam break flows in an urban area. Furthermore, the dimensions were suitable such that it allowed {{the construction of a}} physical model (<b>dam</b> reservoir, <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> and downstream area) having a horizontal scale of 1 / 150 in the available space of 300 m 2. The features creating roughness such as buildings, bridge, and roads were also reflected in the physical model. The dam break flow was investigated for sudden partial collapse, which was simulated by a trapezoidal breach on the <b>dam</b> <b>body.</b> The water depths at downstream area were measured at eight different locations by using e+ WATER L (level) sensors. The velocities were measured at four different locations by ultrasonic velocity profiler (UVP) transducers. The propagation of the flood was recorded by a high-defnition camera. The experimental results show that the Ürkmez area can be flooded in a matter of minutes, at depths reaching up to 3 m in residential areas in 4 min. The flood wave front can reach the residential areas in 2 min and to the sea coast in 4 min. Flow velocities can reach 70. 9 km/h in sparse residential areas, close to <b>dam</b> <b>body.</b> Away from the <b>dam</b> <b>body</b> in the sparse buildings part of the town, the velocities can reach 27. 7 km/h. In dense residential areas of the town, the velocities are too low (2. 8 km/h) but flow depths can reach 3 m. Velocity profiles show similar behavior like unsteady and nonuniform open channel flow in nonresidential areas close to the <b>dam</b> <b>body.</b> In residential areas away from the <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> the velocity profiles are more uniform, having lower velocity values. Vertical variations of velocities show markedly different behavior during rising and recession stages. The profiles are smooth during the rising stage in sparse residential area, yet it shows fluctuating behavior during the recession stage.

Numerical {{results show that the}} Hardfill dam remains at a low stress level and undamaged or slightly damaged during an earthquake with an intensity of 8 degrees. During overload earthquakes, tensile cracks occur at the dam surfaces and extend to inside the <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> and the upstream <b>dam</b> <b>body</b> experiences more serious damage than the downstream <b>dam</b> <b>body.</b> Therefore, under the seismic conditions, the failure pattern of the Hardfill dam is the tensile fracture of the upstream regions and the dam toe.

40|$|The Gotvand-Olya Dam is a rock-fill dam, {{located at}} Khuzestan {{province}} in southwest of Iran. Since the dam {{is subjected to}} the daily water level fluctuation, such as rapid drawdown and refill, thus induce a structural impact {{on the behavior of}} <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> it draws many soil engineering concerns. In this paper, seepage analysis of the rock-fill dam was primarily conducted to evaluate the dam safety against the leakage through the <b>dam</b> <b>body.</b> Traditionally, steady-state analysis was employed to investigate the seepage in the <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> summing that water level is fixed at two cases: high and low water levels. Consequently, it was not able to properly reflect the time-dependent characteristics of seepage phenomena. In this study, seepage analysis was numerically performed using 2 -D FEM transient analysis. As a particular boundary condition for an analysis, the water level fluctuation was incorporated to simulate the daily changes. As a result, various seepage phenomena were quantified such as hydraulic gradient, seepage vector and pore water pressure distribution at the corresponding time of interest as the water level rises and recedes. At steady state analysis, the seepage flux at high water level in downstream area was predicted to be 78 l/s. In additions, the seepage flux measured and estimated were both acceptable considering design criteria. The result of this study proves that {{there is no sign of}} hazardous sources contributing to the possibility of piping, internal erosion and excess leakage through the <b>dam</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R

Dams are mainly divided into four parts {{on the basis of}} the type and materials of construction as gravity dams, buttress dams, arch dams, and embankment dams. There are two types of embankment dams: earthfill dams and rockfill dams. In this study, seepage through an earthfill <b>dam's</b> <b>body</b> is investigated using an artificial neural network model. Seepage is investigated since seepage both in the <b>dam's</b> <b>body</b> and under the foundation adversely affects dam's stability. This study specifically investigated seepage in <b>dam.</b> s <b>body.</b> The seepage in the <b>dams</b> <b>body</b> follows a phreatic line. In order to understand the degree of seepage, it is necessary to measure the level of phreatic line. This measurement is called as piezometric measurement.
