40|$|Background: The service quality {{refers to}} the {{difference}} between hope and the fact received by the customers from the service providers. Satisfaction means disappointments or pleasure that someone experienced after comparing the result of a product or perception of performance with hopes. Recent study by Yeni in 2012 about health service quality and <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> in Sultan Daeng Radja obtained 58, 1 % respondents weren’t satisfied with comfort they got. Dr. sayidiman general hospital of Magetan always tries their best to improve the service quality in order to achieve the target. The hospital effort to improve the service quality was increasing the specialist number, expansion of hospital buildings, and give some more service facilities. The purpose of this research is to know the association between quality of service with satisfaction of <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> in dr. Sayidiman General Hospital of Magetan. Methods: This study design was observational analytic with cross sectional method that define the connection between two variables, independent variable (quality of service) and dependent variable (patient satisfaction). The respondents of this study were <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> in the dr. Sayidiman General Hospital of Magetan taken with accidental sampling method. Total samples were 100 respondents. Data then analyzed with chi-square analysis test. Results: This research conducted with chi-square between service quality variables with patient satisfaction, with the result p < 0, 0001. Conclusion: There is significancy relationship of service quality to satisfaction of <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> in dr. Sayidiman General Hospital of Mageta...|$|R

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. <b>Hospitalized</b> <b>patients</b> often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Adaptation to role {{transitions}} {{can have}} various outcomes. Health and demographic characteristics {{as well as}} environmental control {{have been shown to}} affect the transition to the role of patient. The acutely ill elderly's adaptation to the role of <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> has not been measured from the elderly patient's perspective. This study utilized a random sample of 176 <b>hospitalized</b> elderly medical-surgical <b>patients</b> and the patients' registered nurses to examine the relationships among demographic and health characteristics, latitude of choice and elderly <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> adjustment. Patients were excluded who had been in ICU for more than 24 hours, had decreased mental status, or were judged to be too physically ill to participate. The study used an adaptation of the Latitude of Choice Scale (a measure of environmental control) developed by Hulicka and colleagues, a nurse-rated <b>hospitalized</b> <b>patient</b> adjustment scale developed by Cicirelli, and an adaptation of the adjustment scale for patients' self-assessment. Results from a series of multiple regression analyses indicate that, taken as a group, neither demographic nor health characteristics predict environmental control, as measured by the adapted version of the Latitude of Choice Scale (LOC). However, one individual health characteristic, length of time since last hospitalization, was a negative predictor of LOC. Further, the results indicate that taken as a group, health and demographic characteristics, along with patient LOC scores are not predictive of either nurse or patient-rated adaptation. The individual health characteristic "patient acuity rating" did negatively predict both nurse and patient-rated adjustment scores. Nurse-rated patient adjustment scores were also negatively predicted by the participants' prior number of hospitalizations. A paired-t test indicated that patients rated themselves significantly better adjusted than did their nurses. This finding was judged to be clinically unimportant because of the small real difference in the mean scores. Random-effects ANOVA found no significant variance between nurses' ratings of patients...|$|R
