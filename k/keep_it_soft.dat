5000|$|Taffy (North American English) or chews (British English) {{is a type}} of candy. Taffy is made by {{stretching}} or {{pulling a}} sticky mass of boiled sugar, butter or vegetable oil, flavorings, and colorings until it becomes aerated (meaning that tiny air bubbles are produced, resulting in a light, fluffy and chewy candy). When this process is complete, the taffy is rolled, cut into small pastel-coloured pieces and wrapped in wax paper to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>soft.</b> It is usually fruit-flavored, but other flavors are common as well, including molasses and the [...] "classic" [...] (unflavored) taffy.|$|E

5000|$|The now aerated white toffee {{from the}} pulling machine {{is divided into}} three parts; one will form the centre and two will form the [...] "flaps". The flaps are kneaded and spread thinly and evenly before being placed {{directly}} onto the letters; these form the space between the casing and letters, and are then wrapped around the stiffened centre. The casing is then kneaded and evenly rolled out, using a rolling pin, and this is then wrapped around the assembled [...] "boiling", which is one very large bar of rock, usually too thick for a person to encircle in his hands, that is still pliable and warm. This is then placed into a [...] "batch roller", which has several tapered rollers and heaters.

50|$|The {{double-layered}} coat {{needs to}} be brushed frequently and thoroughly to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> in a show condition. Pet dogs need less maintenance but still a significant amount to keep the dog healthy. The profuse coat picks up grass seeds and burrs, and many dogs tend to mat to some degree, particularly behind the ears, around the collar (if a collar is left on the dog), and in the pants. Shaving a collie may stop it from growing hair in the shaved areas. Spaying and neutering can alter coat texture, making <b>it</b> <b>softer</b> and more prone to matting.|$|R
