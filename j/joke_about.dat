5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Kanye West not understanding a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish. The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the joke was inspired by real people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} was budgeted for two weeks of {{post-production}} photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that {{they came up with}} the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{some things}} on the show evolved into running gags. For example, Rudi Carrell always made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Mike Krüger's nose, who in turn made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the Dutch and their caravans and about Carrell's age. Kalle Pohl {{was the victim of}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> dwarfism, Bernd Stelter about fat people, Oliver Welke about baldness, Jochen Busse about ironing creases and Gaby Köster had to suffer <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> women.|$|R

5|$|New York underboss Johnny Sack becomes enraged after {{learning}} Ralph Cifaretto made an inappropriate <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> his wife's weight. He seeks permission from boss Carmine Lupertazzi to have Ralph clipped, but is denied. Johnny orders the hit anyway. Tony receives the okay from Carmine to hit Johnny Sack for insubordination. Junior Soprano tips Tony {{to use an}} old outfit in Providence for the work. After catching his wife eating sweets secretly, instead of following the diet plan, Johnny Sack gives in, and bloodshed is averted.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Welsh people's supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus {{because it is}} seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members until well into the 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E
50|$|Comedy {{television}} show Saturday Night Live satirized ESPN's {{use of the}} phrase, pointing out the difference in society's reaction to racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Asian people versus racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> black people. In the skit, three sports commentators were featured happily making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Lin's race, while a fourth drew contempt for making similar comments about black players.|$|R
50|$|Some roastees {{have stated}} that certain topics are off-limits. Pamela Anderson, for example, {{prohibited}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her Hepatitis C infection. Joan Rivers disallowed <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her daughter, Melissa and William Shatner asked that {{the death of his}} wife not be mentioned. Others, like David Hasselhoff, have imposed no limits on the topics. Donald Trump only prohibited anyone making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> him not being as wealthy as he says he is. Although Charlie Sheen initially agreed to no restrictions on his roast, he later said during an interview with Jay Leno that he requested <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his mother be edited out of the broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Biggs made {{headlines}} after writing offensive <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Ann Romney and Janna Ryan on his Twitter account during the 2012 Republican National Convention. In March 2014, Biggs caused controversy when <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Four months later, Biggs again generated controversy when he <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. He also drew criticism in May 2014 when he mocked {{the death of}} The Bachelorette contestant Eric Hill.|$|R
5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the feud to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to {{chalk it up to}} a head injury suffered by O'Brien less than two weeks earlier. Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} running jokes {{throughout}} the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how his equipment is often lost, {{damaged or destroyed}} by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is in the lab ("Now pay attention") as Q rattles off details {{about the use of}} the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> my work"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes full advantage of the tools supplied.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.|$|E
5000|$|Caution had to {{be taken}} with <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> drink, with not too many allowed to be made in any single programme. Also to be avoided were {{derogatory}} references to solicitors, miners and [...] "the working class". Banned too was any reference to The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, or <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his name, in response to previous complaints.|$|R
40|$|<b>Jokes</b> <b>about</b> stupidity are {{extremely}} common in most countries, as ethnic, national, regional and locality jokes, political <b>jokes,</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> occupations and social classes, and blonde and Essex-girl jokes. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a theory that will explain why such diverse groups of people should be the butts of what is essentially the same joke. It will also explain jokes that are the opposite of the stupidity jokes, the widespread <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the canny (clever, crafty, calculating, stingy), whether <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> ethnic groups, regional groups, townspeople or occupations. The key explanatory variables are first, the dominance of centre over periphery whether defined in geographical, cultural, language or social class terms and second, among the powerful, the contrast between those who hold arbitrary monopoly power based on control of the state and the means of force and those who have achieved their position through legitimate competition...|$|R

25|$|In 1994 Landrieu made an {{unsuccessful}} {{bid for the}} office of Mayor of New Orleans; the office went to Marc Morial, the son of another former mayor (the contest between sons of former mayors prompted some commentators to <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> establishing a tradition of primogeniture for the city's top office).|$|E
50|$|As a result, Leno was {{initially}} {{not allowed to}} tell <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Shows opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others. The gag order was challenged, and {{the court ruled that}} Leno could continue telling <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.|$|R

25|$|While it was {{a popular}} {{destination}} for tourists, businesses such as delivery and taxicab services would not serve residents living on Butt Hole Road, believing that the name was simply a prank. Those living on the street would also receive phone calls from pranksters making a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the street name, and the residents eventually had their phone number removed from public listings. The name of the street inspired authors Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey to create the book Rude Britain, a compilation of inappropriate place names in Great Britain, after reading an article about a couple who purchased {{a house on the}} street.|$|E
25|$|In {{an episode}} of the {{television}} comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. The tactics he used failed, as a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> the unreliability of Wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as {{a section of the}} actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.|$|E
