40|$|This release {{contains}} several contributions, but focusses on the stabilisation of the playbook {{and roles}} providing the Shibboleth IdP (V 2) functionality. Several fixes {{have been made}} to ensure that the Ansible code in the roles is updated to Ansible- 2. x syntax. Work has also been done to put in place commerical certificates if they are present, right from the start, and deploying self-signed certificates as a default <b>fall-back</b> <b>approach.</b> Some work has been done to move the sensitive ldap role variables to the vault-encrypted passwords file for the group (site) that the services fall under. The release is not "containerised", meaning that there is no use yet of Ansible-Container...|$|E

Analysis of tokamak {{fusion power}} {{plants such as}} the EU power plant {{conceptual}} study (PPCS) makes clear that, to ensure that tokamaks can be exploited to generate electricity at economically attractive rates, improvements beyond the ITER baseline performance levels are required. Recent studies within the EU which extend {{the results of the}} PPCS analysis have pursued the development of a more quantitative description of physics performance in such devices. The PPCS study showed that high beta and high density appear explicitly in the derived scaling for the cost of electricity (CoE). Additional critical factors include the ability to handle the power exhausted from the plasma while maintaining high energy confinement quality, high beta and acceptable plasma contamination, achievement of sufficiently high current drive efficiencies to maintain steady-state operation, the exploitation of auxiliary heating and current drive systems to maintain the current profiles required for high confinement and mhd stability, and the use of active feedback control techniques for mhd instabilities. Steady-state operation is considered to be the preferred operating scenario for fusion reactors following ITER and has formed the focus of these studies, but the development of the “hybrid ” scenario, with enhanced plasma confinement and mhd stability characteristics, offers a <b>fall-back</b> <b>approach</b> to power plant operation.

40|$|In mobile ad hoc network, {{efficient}} {{routing protocol}} {{is required to}} perform route discovery and maintenance. These protocols can be classified into two main types which are proactive and reactive routing protocols. Most of them usually use the suboptimal path to reach destination without considering QoS parameters. This results in network congestion during high traffic load situation. Hence, many algorithms have been proposed to offer QoS routing to these protocols. However, most of them find the feasible path by using {{only one or two}} QoS metrics. This is not enough to support many applications with QoS guaranteed, especially multimedia applications since they have more stringent various QoS requirements. To provide QoS routing in ad hoc network based on such environment, we propose the effective algorithm called Generalized MCP (G_MCP) to find the feasible path based on proposed weighted Connectivity Index (combination of link connectivity and capacity) and non-linear cost (combination of multiple additive QoS metrics using non-linear function). We adopt the <b>fall-back</b> <b>approach.</b> That is, G_MCP will find the path from source to destination by considering weighted Connectivity Index first. If there is a tie, the path with least non-linear cost will be chosen. Based on this approach, G_MCP has the comparable time complexity with the Shortest-Widest Path algorithm. We construct the simulation in a number of scenarios based on proactive protocol called OLSR. According to the simulation results, it is obvious that G_MCP performances are superior than OLSR and Shortest-Widest Path algorithms in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio, delay and success ratio. Therefore, it can be concluded that G_MCP is able to support various applications and be operated well in highly dynamic mobility environmen...|$|E
40|$|Preferences and {{strategies}} are fundamental to model-based diagnosis, for specifying preferred and <b>fall-back</b> <b>approaches</b> to the diagnosis task, both to capture general and domain specific criteria, {{but also to}} tackle the complexity issue by employing heuristics. A formal framework based on extended logic programming and meta-programs is provided to represent preferences {{and strategies}} required by model-based diagnosis. This framework is clearer and more expressive than other approaches that have addressed these problems. We show how the concepts of preferences and strategies are directly programmed and captured by logic meta-programming and meta-reasoning methods, and their implementation techniques. The paper is intended as proof-of-principle that all concepts needed by a model-based diagnosis system can represented declaratively and captured by a logic meta-program. Specialized more efficient algorithms can be substituted for the simpler proof-of-principle ones we include, and are the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT) is {{the most}} serious cattle disease in sub-Saharan Africa. It is managed through vector control, keeping trypanotolerant cattle, but most importantly, by the use of {{trypanocidal}} drugs. Resistance to trypanocidal drugs is emerging and threatens the livelihoods of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in sub-Saharan Africa who depend on cattle for traction, manure, milk, meat, savings, insurance, status and cultural obligations. A study was carried out in the cotton zone of west Africa (south west Burkina Faso, south Mali and north east Guinea) to: firstly, characterise trypanosomosis control and epidemiology in villages with presence or risk of drug resistance; secondly develop, test, and evaluate best-bet strategies for the control of trypanosomosis in the presence/risk of drug resistance; thirdly, model the dynamics of trypanocide resistance. To understand the situation, Knowledge, Attitude and Practice questionnaires were administered to all cattle-keepers in 65 villages, an Agricultural Knowledge and Information Study on trypanosomosis management was carried out in eight villages, Participatory Rural Appraisals held in seven villages and 73 animal health service providers interviewed. Entomological studies were carried out in 54 villages, 16 935 cattle were examined parasitologically for trypanosomes, 834 blood samples were checked for haemoparasites and 1 463 coprological samples examined. Three strategies were evaluated for trypanosomosis management: participatory vector control in eight villages, keeping trypanotolerant cattle in 65 villages and rational drug use (RDU); the latter by informing farmers in 46 villages, establishing/evaluating primary health services in 18 villages and training service providers who covered 235 villages. A dynamic mathematical model was developed to elucidate development and reversal of trypanocide resistance. We found AAT was the most important cattle disease in the area and was managed at community level. Animal health services were dysfunctional, with a large informal sector and low quality in the formal sector. Policy deficits and incoherencies impede the management of AAT: most actors were unaware of trypanocide resistance. Modelling suggested resistance is inevitable given agricultural intensification, will worsen without intervention, but can be reversed by vector control. All strategies were effective at managing trypanosomosis, but rational drug use had the highest benefit-cost ratio. Vector control delivered most benefits, but because of high transaction costs requires continued support. Vector control, funded as a public good, is recommended for the containment of resistance, and RDU for its prevention. Trypanotolerant cattle-keeping is less attractive to farmers but should be retained as a <b>fall-back</b> option. Integrated <b>approaches</b> to AAT management combined with initiatives to promote evidence-based policy are likely to prove the best bet for trypanosomosis management under risk of resistance in the cotton zone of west Africa...|$|R
