40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} commitment schemes that are secure against concurrent poly-time man-in-the-middle (cMiM) attacks. Under such attacks, two possible notions {{of security for}} commitment schemes have been proposed in the literature: concurrent nonmalleability with respect to commitment and concurrent non-malleability with respect <b>to</b> <b>decommitment</b> (i. e., opening). After the original notion of non-malleability introduced by [Dolev, Dwork and Naor STOC 91] {{that is based on}} the independence of the committed and decommitted message, a new and stronger notion of non-malleability has been given in [Pass and Rosen STOC 05] by requiring that for any man-in-the-middle adversary there is a stand-alone adversary that succeeds with the same probability. Under this stronger security notion, a constant-round commitment scheme that is concurrent non-malleable only with respect to commitment has been given in [Pass and Rosen FOCS 05] for the plain model, thus leaving as an open problem the construction of a constant-round concurrent non-malleable commitments with respect <b>to</b> <b>decommitment...</b>|$|R
