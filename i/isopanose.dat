40|$|Iso{{pullulan}}ase (IPU) from Aspergillus niger A. T. C. C. (American Type Culture Collection) 9642 hydrolyses pullulan to <b>isopanose.</b> IPU {{is important}} for the production of <b>isopanose</b> and is used in the structural analysis of oligosaccharides with alpha- 1, 4 and alpha- 1, 6 glucosidic linkages. We have isolated the ipuA gene encoding IPU from the filamentous fungi A. niger A. T. C. C. 9642. The ipuA gene encodes an open reading frame of 1695 bp (564 amino acids). IPU contained a signal sequence of 19 amino acids, and the molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 59 kDa. IPU has no amino-acid-sequence similarity with the other pullulan-hydrolysing enzymes, which are pullulanase, neopullulanase and glucoamylase. However, IPU showed a high amino-acid-sequence similarity with dextranases from Penicillium minioluteum (61 %) and Arthrobacter sp. (56 %). When the ipuA gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, the expressed protein (recombinant IPU) had IPU activity and was immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against native IPU. The substrate specificity, thermostability and pH profile of recombinant IPU were identical with those of the native enzyme, but recombinant IPU (90 kDa) was larger than the native enzyme (69 - 71 kDa). After deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycosidase F, the deglycosylated recombinant IPU had the same molecular mass as deglycosylated native enzyme (59 kDa). This result suggests that the carbohydrate chain of recombinant IPU differed from that of the native enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} a new {{amylolytic enzyme}} of Bacillus licheniformis (BLMA) has been cloned, and we characterized the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. The genomic DNA of B. licheniformis was double-digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated the pBR 322. The transformed E. coli {{was selected by}} its amylolytic activity, which carries the recombinant plasmid pIJ 322 containing a 3. 5 -kilobase fragment of B. licheniformis DNA. The purified enzyme encoded by pIJ 322 was capable of hydrolyzing pullulan and cyclodextrin as well as starch. It was active over a pH range of 6 - 8 and its optimum temperature was 50 °C. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 64, 000, and the isoelectric point was 5. 4. It degraded soluble starch by cleaving maltose units preferentially but did not attack α- 1, 6 -linkage. The enzyme also hydrolyzed pullulan to panose units exclusively. In the presence of glucose, however, it transferred the panosyl moiety to glucose {{with the formation of}} α- 1, 6 - linkage. The specificity of transferring activity is evident from the result of the maltosyl-transferring reaction which produces <b>isopanose</b> from maltotriose and glucose. The molecular structure of the enzyme deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the clone maintains limited similarity in the conserved regions to the other amylolytic enzymes. ope...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus reuteri strain ATCC 55730 (LB BIO) was {{isolated}} as a pure culture from a Reuteri tablet purchased from the BioGaia company. This probiotic strain produces a soluble glucan (reuteran), {{in which the}} majority of the linkages are of the -(134) glucosidic type (70 %). This reuteran also contains -(136) -linked glucosyl units and 4, 6 -disubstituted -glucosyl units at the branching points. The LB BIO glucansucrase gene (gtfO) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the GTFO enzyme was purified. The recombinant GTFO enzyme and the LB BIO culture supernatants synthesized identical glucan polymers with respect to linkage type and size distribution. GTFO thus is a reuteransucrase, responsible for synthesis of this reuteran polymer in LB BIO. The preference of GTFO for synthesizing -(134) linkages is also evident from the oligosaccharides produced from sucrose with different acceptor substrates, e. g., <b>isopanose</b> from isomaltose. GTFO has a relatively high hydrolysis/transferase activity ratio. Complete conversion of 100 mM sucrose by GTFO nevertheless yielded large amounts of reuteran, although more than 50 % of sucrose was converted into glucose. This is only the second example of the isolation and characterization of a reuteransucrase and its reuteran product, both found in different L. reuteri strains. GTFO synthesizes a reuteran with the highest amount of -(134) linkages reported to date. Lactic acid bacteria are gram-positive bacteria, represente...|$|E
40|$|Maltodextrin is {{a mixture}} of maltooligosaccharides, which are {{produced}} by the degradation of starch or glycogen. They are mostly composed of alpha- 1, 4 - and some alpha- 1, 6 -linked glucose residues. Genes presumed to code for the Enterococcus faecalis maltodextrin transporter were induced during enterococcal infection. We therefore carried out a detailed study of maltodextrin transport in this organism. Depending on their length (3 to 7 glucose residues), E. faecalis takes up maltodextrins either via MalT, a maltose-specific permease of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) : carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS), or the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter MdxEFG-MsmX. Maltotriose, the smallest maltodextrin, is primarily transported by the PTS permease. A malT mutant therefore exhibits significantly reduced growth on maltose and maltotriose. The residual uptake of the trisaccharide is catalyzed by the ABC transporter, because a malT mdxF double mutant no longer grows on maltotriose. The trisaccharide arrives as maltotriose- 6 ''-P in the cell. MapP, which dephosphorylates maltose- 6 '-P, also releases Pi from maltotriose- 6 ''-P. Maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins are mainly (or exclusively) taken up via the ABC transporter, because inactivation of the membrane protein MdxF prevents growth on maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins up to at least maltoheptaose. E. faecalis also utilizes panose and <b>isopanose,</b> and we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that in contrast to maltotriose, its two isomers are primarily transported via the ABC transporter. We confirm that maltodextrin utilization via MdxEFG-MsmX affects the colonization capacity of E. faecalis, because inactivation of mdxF significantly reduced enterococcal colonization and/or survival in kidneys and liver of mice after intraperitoneal infection. IMPORTANCE Infections by enterococci, which are major health care-associated pathogens, are difficult to treat due to their increasing resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, and new strategies are urgently needed. A largely unexplored aspect is how these pathogens proliferate and which substrates they use in order to grow inside infected hosts. The use of maltodextrins as a source of carbon and energy was studied in Enterococcus faecalis and linked to its virulence. Our results demonstrate that E. faecalis can efficiently use glycogen degradation products. We show here that depending on the length of the maltodextrins, one of two differen...|$|E
