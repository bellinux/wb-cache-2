40|$|The {{economic}} value of pasture improvement in a farming {{system in a}} Mediterranean-type environment is assessed using farm modelling. Bioeconomic modelling combined with sensitivity analysis is used to explore how new annual legume species may impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and land use. If introduced on all suitable soils the new pastures lead to a 26 % increase in <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> with an additional 12 % of farm area being switched into pasture to support more livestock. However, stocking rates decline slightly, the enterprise mix becomes less diversified and several rotational changes are required. If the new pastures are only introduced on particular soils then <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> increases by a lesser percentage and the pathways to additional profit vary, with both the pasture area and stocking rate either increasing or decreasing. To extract maximum profit from pasture improvement on any particular land management unit often requires management changes on other land management units, apart from those on which pasture improvement initially takes place. The {{economic value}} of pasture improvement is found {{to depend on the}} portfolio of pastures available for improvement and the nature and mix of the farm's land management units.

40|$|Direct {{policies}} {{for the management}} of nonpoint source pollution are difficult to apply given asymmetric information, spatial and temporal variability, and uncertainty. There is increasing awareness that these limitations may be overcome where profitable mitigation practices are broadly adopted by polluters. Nitrification inhibitors (chemicals applied to paddocks that retard the nitrification process in soils) are a rare example of a mitigation practice that reduces pollutant loads and potentially increases <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> through promoting pasture production. This study investigates their capacity to achieve both goals to inform policy makers and producers of their potential for simultaneously improving <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and water quality. With an assumed 10 percent increase in pasture production in response to nitrification inhibitor application, nitrification inhibitors are a profitable innovation because greater pasture production supports higher stocking rates. Nonetheless, their overall impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> is low, even when the cost of inhibitors or their impact on subsequent pasture production is substantially altered. However, inhibitors are found to be a critical mitigation practice for farmers posed with decreasing leaching loads to satisfy regulatory requirements. These findings suggest that, despite their shortcomings for nonpoint pollution regulation, direct policies appear to {{be the only way to}} motivate producers to account for their impact on environmental values given the current lack of profitable mitigations...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical and {{computerized}} {{models are}} developed {{to design and}} optimize furrow irrigation systems. The optimization process starts with land grading design, if any is needed, followed by a prediction of maximum non-erosive furrow stream size allowed on a given soil and the associated furrow-advance function. An average depth of application per irrigation is then assumed from which the wetting pattern along the furrow and the amounts of runoff water are predicted. A design of an Irrigation Runoff Recovery System, IRRS, is then executed, if desired, and system cost is determined. Using the predicted wetting pattern and the appropriate Crop Production Function, the gross return and the net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> associated with that particular average depth of application per irrigation are determined. The iterative procedure is continued by changing the average depth of application per irrigation and evaluating net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> until a depth and the associated system design and management program which yield the highest net profit are found. A Fortran IV detailed computer program is developed to perform the above procedure. The program is comprehensive and very flexible {{so that it can}} be used both for research and practical design purposes and can accommodate further improvements and expansion.

40|$|Abstract. Natural {{resource}} {{indicators are}} used by catchment management organisations as targets for land use management. However, {{the nature of the}} trade-off function between natural resource management (NRM) outcomes and whole-farm profit is ill-defined, and varies between regions and according to the particular NRM indicator considered. Defining this function will assist catchment management organisations and farmers to evaluate the achievability of particular targets, and help determine the size of economic incentives required to offset any expected loss in <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> associated with meeting targets. We addressed this issue by modelling representative farm businesses in two mixed farming regions (southern New South Wales and the central wheatbelt of Western Australia). The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and GRAZPLAN farming systems models were linked and used to generate values of four NRM indicators (water leakage, nitrate leaching, groundcover and soil organic carbon change) {{for a wide range of}} crop–pasture rotations. The NRM indicator values were then incorporated into the Model of an Integrated Dryland System (MIDAS) whole-farm economic model to define the relationship with <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and farm cropping percentage. For some circumstances and indicators, the resulting trade-off functions were relatively flat; a wide range of enterprise mixes can lead to the same NRM outcomes but significant gains in the indicators may not be possible using current rotation options. For others, significant improvements could be achieved but at a substantial loss in whole-farm profit (through the selection of less profitable rotations). There were also examples where simultaneous gains in indicators and <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> wer...|$|E

40|$|As water {{resources}} are limited {{and the demand}} for agricultural products increases, it becomes increasingly important to use irrigation water optimally. At a farm scale, farmer’s have a particularly strong incentive to optimize their irrigation water use when the volume of water available over a season is production limiting. In this situation, a farmer’s goal is to maximize <b>farm</b> <b>profit,</b> by adjusting when and where irrigation water is used. However, making the very best decisions about when and where to irrigate is not easy, since these daily decisions require consideration of the entire remaining irrigation season. Future rainfall uncertainty further complicates decisions on when and which crops should be subjected to water stress. This paper presents an innovative on-farm irrigation scheduling decision support method called the Canterbury irrigation scheduler (CIS) that is suitable when seasonal water availability is limited. Previous optimal scheduling methods generally use stochastic dynamic programming, which requires over-simplistic plant models, limiting their practical usefulness. The CIS method improves on previous methods because it accommodates realistic plant models. Future <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> (the objective function) is calculated using a time-series simulation model of the farm. Different irrigation management strategies are tested using the farm simulation model. The irrigation strategies are defined by a set of decision variables, and the decision variables are optimized using simulated annealing. The result of this optimization is an irrigation strategy that maximizes the expected future <b>farm</b> <b>profit.</b> This process is repeated several times during the irrigation season using the CIS method, and the optimal irrigation strategy is modified and improved using updated climate and soil moisture information. The ability of the CIS method to produce near optimal decisions was demonstrated by a comparison to previous stochastic dynamic programming schedulers. A second case study shows the CIS method can incorporate more realistic farm models than is possible when using stochastic dynamic programming. This case study used the FarmWi$e/APSIM model developed by CSIRO, Australia. Results show that when seasonal water limit is the primary constraint on water availability, the CIS could increase pasture yield revenue in Canterbury (New Zealand) in the order of 10 %, compared with scheduling irrigation using current state of the art scheduling practice...|$|E
