40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the ability}} of the {{distinct}} lattice spring model (DLSM) for modeling stress wave propagation in rocks was fully investigated. The influence of particle size on simulation of different types of stress waves (e. g. one-dimensional (1 D) P-wave, 1 D S-wave and two-dimensional (2 D) cylindrical wave) was studied through comparing results predicted by the DLSM with different mesh ratios (lr) and those obtained from the corresponding analytical solutions. Suggested values of lr were obtained for modeling these stress waves accurately. Moreover, the weak material layer method and virtual <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> method were used to model P-wave and S-wave propagating through a single discontinuity. The results were compared with the classical analytical solutions, indicating that the virtual <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> method can give better results and is recommended.

40|$|The use of rock bolts as rock {{reinforcement}} {{is becoming}} more popular in Malaysia. However, its effectiveness depends {{on a number of}} factors particularly with regards to the technique of installing the bolt. Its reinforcement mechanism also restricts its application for certain modes of instability and types of rock. This paper highlights a laboratory investigation on the reinforcement mechanisms of rock bolts, specifically on bolt inclination, anchorage type and level of pre-tension. The investigation was conducted using a physical model of a rock bolt intersecting a <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Results obtained show that a better reinforcement can be obtained if bolt is inclined at an angle to the <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> so that it elongates upon joint displacement. Full-bonded bolt is more superior in terms of mobilising the anchorage capacity and consequently, this allows for immediate utilisation of the reinforcing element.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a three-dimensional model for jointed rock or other media {{with a single}} set of joints. The joint set consists of evenly spaced joint planes. The normal joint response is nonlinear elastic {{and is based on}} a rational polynomial. Joint shear stress is treated as being linear elastic in the shear stress versus slip displacement before attaining a critical stress level governed by a Mohr-Coulomb faction criterion. The three-dimensional model represents an extension of a two-dimensional, multi-joint model that has been in use for several years. Although most of the concepts in the two-dimensional model translate in a straightforward manner to three dimensions, the concept of slip on the joint planes becomes more complex in three dimensions. While slip in two dimensions can be treated as a scalar quantity, it must be treated as a vector in the <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> in three dimensions. For the three-dimensional model proposed here, the slip direction is assumed to be the direction of maximum principal strain in the <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Five test problems are presented to verify the correctness of the computational implementation of the model...|$|E

50|$|More recently, {{the debate}} has been reopened by Jeffrey Schaffer, who {{suggests}} {{that the role of}} glaciers and other erosion processes has been dramatically overstated.

40|$|Continuous fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastics}} {{often are}} offered as impregnated and consolidated semi-finished products which {{are known as}} organic sheets. The thermoplastic matrix leads to several advantages including the thermoformability and weldability. Parts made of organic sheets are frequently produced by forming the semi-finished product into half-shells and stiffening those shells {{in the course of}} the process e. g. by the injection moulding of ribs. Larger and more complex parts with hollow body structures can be manufactured e. g. by forming the semi-finished products into half-shells and joining the half-shells. However, the currently available manufacturing technologies for parts made of organic sheets have cap profile shaped joints which prevent the use of the reinforcing fibres across the <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Investigations have proven that overlapping weld joints in organic sheets show much higher strengths than cap profile shaped joints which can be explained by the fibre use across the <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Furthermore, the infrared welding technology was verified as an appropriate process for the welding of organic sheets since no need for additional welding material is given, short heating times can be realized and no contact of the infrared emitters to the joining parts is required.
