The <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> of Greater Bombay were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Bombay. On 1 October 1990, the Greater Bombay district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, Bombay City and Bombay Suburban, though they continued to be administered by same Municipal Administration.|$|E

Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both. Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.|$|E

25|$|Honduras shares {{rivers and}} {{watersheds}} {{with its neighbors}} and 16% of the surface water in Honduras leaves the country by river towards El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. For Example, the Río Lempa (3.87km3) and the Río Goascorán (1.2km3) together convey 5.07km3 of water per year to El Salvador. No international agreements exist with the aforementioned countries to regulate the joint utilization and management of shared water resources. There exists only treaties marking <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> that do not take into consideration shared water resources.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, the British Army {{contracted}} the Palestine Electric Company for wired electric power. The contract allowed the Electric Company {{to extend the}} grid beyond the original <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> that had been projected by the concession it was given. The high-tension line that exceeded {{the limits of the}} original concession ran along some major towns and agricultural settlements, offering extended connections to the Jewish towns of Rishon Le-Zion, Ness Ziona and Rehovot (in spite of their proximity to the high-tension line, the Arab towns of Ramleh and Lydda remained unconnected).|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} frontier cities once {{marked the}} boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical-year restrictions within that same border, or, {{in the event of}} being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate therefrom only the demai-tithe. As one moved further east of Achziv, the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south Lebanon, and as far east as places in the present-day Kingdom of Jordan. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law (Halacha), they did not always reflect a political reality, insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.|$|E

2500|$|Phillips {{argued that}} {{large-scale}} plantation slavery was inefficient and not progressive.

He admitted the failure was that no one graduated from this school.|$|E

50|$|The {{first wave}} of people with farming and pottery {{technology}} in northern Europe was the LBK culture which originated in central Europe and reached a <b>geographical</b> <b>limit</b> in the fertile southern Haspengouw part of Limburg about 5000 BC, only to die out about 4000 BC. A later wave from central Europe, the Michelsburg culture arrived about 3500 BC and shared a similar fate. Pottery technology had however apparently been taken up by local tribes of the Swifterbant culture, who remained present throughout.|$|R
2500|$|Within the [...] "spondiogenys group", {{the gradual}} clinal {{variation}} over the large geographic range and the extensive intergradation {{means that the}} <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities. The International Ornithologists' Union lists 11 subspecies from this group, whereas Peter Clement in the Handbook of Birds of the World lists seven and considers {{the features of the}} subspecies balearica (Mallorca), caucasica (southern Caucasus), schiebeli (southern Greece, Crete and western Turkey), and tyrrhenica (Corsica) to fall within the variation of the nominate subspecies.

50|$|Management must {{embrace a}} {{holistic}} viewpoint {{of the functions}} that makeup the complex and dynamic nature of interactions in the coastal environment.

60|$|The {{change in}} the {{national}} character is so evident, immediately on crossing into Belgium, as to occasion surprise. The region was, at no remote period, all Flanders. The same language is still spoken, the same religion professed in both countries, and yet a certain secret moral influence appears to have extended itself from the capital of each country, until they have met on the frontier, where both have been arrested within their proper <b>geographical</b> <b>limits.</b> We had come into this village on a gallop, driven with the lighthearted étourderie of French vanity, and we left it gravely, {{under the guidance of}} postilions who philosophically smoked, as their cattle trotted along like elephants.|$|E
60|$|Of very {{restricted}} ranges {{there are}} many examples, but {{some of these are}} subject to doubts as to the distinctness of the species or as to its <b>geographical</b> <b>limits</b> being really known. In Europe we have a distinct species of ibex (Capra Pyrenaica) confined to the Pyrenean mountains, while the true marmot is restricted to the Alpine range. More remarkable is the Pyrenean water-mole (Mygale Pyrenaica), a curious small insectivorous animal found only in a few places in the northern valleys of the Pyrenees. In islands {{there are many}} cases of undoubted restriction of species to a small area, but these involve a different question from the range of species on continents where there is no apparent obstacle to their wider extension.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is so much}} {{grave and}} respectable authority, to prove the {{existence}} of these evil influences, that it requires a pen hardier than any we wield, to attack them without a suitable motive. [...] "Flashy people," [...] says the learned and pious Cotton Mather, Doctor of Divinity and Fellow of the Royal Society, [...] "may burlesque these things; but when hundreds of the most sober people, in a country where they have as much mother wit, certainly, as the rest of mankind, know them to be true, nothing but the absurd and froward spirit of Sadducism can question them." [...] Against this grave and credited authority, we pretend to raise no question of scepticism. We submit to the testimony of such a writer as conclusive, though as credulity is sometimes found to be bounded by <b>geographical</b> <b>limits,</b> and to possess something of a national character, it may be prudent to refer certain readers, who dwell in the other hemisphere, to the Common Law of England, on this interesting subject, as it is ingeniously expounded by Keeble and approved by the twelve judges of that highly civilized and enlightened island. With this brief reference to so grave authorities, in support of what we have now to offer, we shall return to the matter of the narrative, fully trusting that its incidents will throw some additional light on the subject of so deep and so general concern.|$|E
