5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the <b>Halls</b> Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the <b>Halls.</b> Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that <b>Halls</b> Heelers became freely available.|$|E
5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material during the Han dynasty; {{it was used to}} build palace <b>halls,</b> multi-story residential towers and <b>halls</b> and single-story houses. Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles. The oldest surviving wooden <b>halls</b> in China date to the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.|$|E

Innis, New, St. Michael's, Trinity, University, Victoria, and Woodsworth colleges reserve most of their dormitories for their undergraduate students within the Faculty of Arts and Science, while setting a portion available to students from the professional and postgraduate faculties. Massey College is exclusively for graduate students, while Knox and Wycliffe Colleges mainly house graduate theology students. Annesley Hall of Victoria College, a National Historic Site, was the first university residence for women in Canada.
