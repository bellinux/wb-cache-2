500|$|Guests {{enter the}} queue from the Antarctica-themed {{area of the}} park. Large groups of riders and non-riders are {{admitted}} into a pre-show room, where multiple projections of an Antarctic landscape are blended with 3D exhibits. In a narrated video, guests are introduced to a <b>gentoo</b> <b>penguin</b> colony in Antarctica featuring a newborn penguin named Puck. After the pre-show guests follow a path to a junction. Non-riders watch another, smaller pre-show before entering the penguin exhibit. Riders choose a [...] "mild" [...] or [...] "wild" [...] ride. They are then divided into groups of eight riders before boarding the ride vehicles at one of four stations. Riders are seated in two rows of four, and restrained by seat belts.|$|E

[...] Gentoo describes itself as a meta-distribution because of its adaptability, in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to themselves.|$|E
