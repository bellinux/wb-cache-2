40|$|The work {{presented}} {{in this issue of}} Architectural Design focuses on surface in an effort to recognise a spatial condition that lies outside traditional architectural models of surface and substrate. Shifting between <b>digital</b> <b>constructions,</b> computer science imaging, built realisation, and theoretical aspects; issues of transparency, articulation and stability are brought to the fore. The focus is on surface as the subject of study rather than the oppositional formation of whether surface is depth or depth is surface or the phrenologist's ability to strip away to find hidden depths. For some contributors surface is investigated as a meaningful relationship between contemporary methods of visioning, making, and fabricating. Other papers discuss contemporary perceptions relative to historical and theoretical frameworks...|$|R

This is done throughanalyzing children 9 ̆ 2 s activities when working hands on with a modelling task, and also through informal interviews andexhibitions where children described their work to peers and teachers who had not taken part in the activities. Our resultssuggest that handling the technology, relating to others, and negotiating ideas, are prominent aspects in these activities. Based on these results, we discuss the different activities involved in learning to create <b>digital</b> <b>constructions</b> and howthese relate to several important topics that are emphasized in educational research that draws on socio-culturalperspectives on action and learning.

50|$|While the DTV Delay Act {{extended}} this {{deadline to}} June 12, 2009, Equity had applied for {{an extension of}} the <b>digital</b> <b>construction</b> permit in order to retain the broadcast license after the station went dark.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{distinction}} between interactive visualizations and animation, the most useful categorization is probably between abstract and model-based scientific visualizations. The abstract visualizations show completely conceptual constructs in 2D or 3D. These generated shapes are completely arbitrary. The model-based visualizations either place overlays of data on real or digitally constructed images of reality or make a <b>digital</b> <b>construction</b> of a real object directly from the scientific data.|$|E
50|$|On July 18, 2008, KCWK {{reported}} to the FCC that digital television equipment needed {{in time for the}} upcoming 2009 digital transition had not yet been obtained as this could not be done without prior approval of the bankruptcy court.
