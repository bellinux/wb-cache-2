500|$|There are two {{shooting}} modes: Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players {{control the}} shot by sliding their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} screen, which calculates the arc {{and direction of the}} shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power if held too long. There are no power-ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to see the end of the universe. It also integrates [...] "pro-social" [...] features like GameCenter and Twitter.|$|E
2500|$|Since Braille {{is one of}} the few writing systems where tactile {{perception}} is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills. [...] One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> words. [...] There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.|$|E

60|$|Having {{received}} it, {{he ran his}} <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> columns, and dashing {{down the}} book, declared that no such name was there.|$|E
60|$|Having {{taken his}} leave {{of the friends}} who had flocked about him with the {{observation}} {{that he had a}} long journey before him, he called for the axe, and, when presented to him, ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge, and smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] {{she whispered}} joyously, [...] "here {{it has been}} all the time." [...] Running her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> molding until she found a little hidden spring, she pushed it, {{and one of the}} great panels swung slowly in, {{revealing}} the yawning mouth of a black opening behind.|$|E
6000|$|... “She won’t stand much of this,” Jimmy said gravely, {{running the}} end of his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> shallow groove made by the sharp teeth of the {{splitting}} ice.|$|R
6000|$|... "For awhile. Until {{they get}} {{reinforcements}} {{from some other}} area." [...] Tasso began to clean {{the interior of the}} gun with a bit of rag. She finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun, running her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> barrel.|$|R
6000|$|Helen ran {{the point}} of her slim <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> sketch until it reached a tiny dormer window in the {{left-hand}} corner, half-hidden by an irregular chimney-stack. The curtains were closely drawn. Keeping her finger upon the spot, she said, interrogatively, [...] "And you saw THAT window?" ...|$|R
60|$|What strange {{business}} had he here {{among the dead}} that demanded such caution in its pursuit? Presently he advanced toward the pile of corpses. Quickly he tore open coats and searched pockets. He ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> fingers of the dead. Two rings had rewarded his search and he was busy with a third that encircled the finger of a body that lay beneath three others. It would not come off. He pulled and tugged, and then he drew a knife from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|He rose briskly {{from his}} chair, {{and went to}} the shelves, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> books with that subtlety of touch by which the student knows a given book in the dark. He had heard Mrs. Ewbert {{stirring}} about in the rooms beyond with an activity in which he divined a menacing impatience; and he would have been glad to get rid of old Hilbrook before her impatience burst in an irruption upon them. Perhaps because of this distraction he could not find the book, but he remained on foot, talking with an implication in his tone that they were both preparing to part, and were now merely finishing off some odds and ends of discourse before they said good-night.|$|E
6000|$|... "'For at dawn you die!'" [...] he {{repeated}} to himself, still smiling broadly. Then he crossed {{quickly to the}} fireplace, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge {{of one of the}} large tiled panels that hid the entrance to the well-like shaft that rose from the cellars beneath to the towers above and which opened through similar concealed exits upon each floor. If the floor above should be untenanted {{he might be able to}} reach it as he and Joseph had done two years ago when they opened the secret panel in the fireplace and climbed a hidden ladder to the room overhead; and then by vacant corridors reached the far end of the castle above the suite in which the princess had been confined and near which Barney had every reason to believe she was now imprisoned.|$|E
60|$|Crossing to the {{obviously}} tight window, {{he ran his}} <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> edge of the sash with infinite care. He trembled. In a second, now, he had to {{turn and}} make light of the lips which he would fain have approached with ceremony pompous and lingering.|$|R
60|$|He feverishly ran a <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> upper rim of {{his left}} ear, sprang up, stooped to take her hand, glared into her eyes till she shrank--and then a nail-cleaner, a common, ten-cent file, fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step.|$|R

60|$|Elsie, in the meantime, {{had left}} the house and crept round it on the grass until she reached a {{greenhouse}} built against {{one side of the}} drawing-room. The door was open, as she had expected, and, feeling for the edge of a flower-stand, she followed it up until she could crouch down beside the steps leading to a French window. It was closed but not latched, for when she ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> joint, she felt an aperture; but she dared not try to pull it open. Still, she could see in. The lamps had not been lighted, but an electric torch lay on the table and threw a ring of light on the opposite wall, two or three feet from the ground. The rest of the room was in darkness, but a dim illumination which spread beyond the bright beam showed two figures faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Their {{trains are}} always late," [...] said Phipps, with his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of his}} collar. Dangle, you must understand, was a sub-editor and reviewer, and his pride was to be Thomas Plantagenet's {{intellectual}} companion. Widgery, the big man, was manager of a bank and a mighty golfer, and his conception of his relations to her never came into his mind without those charming oldlines, [...] "Douglas, Douglas, tender and true," [...] falling hard upon its heels. His name was Douglas-Douglas Widgery. And Phipps, Phipps was a medical student still, and {{he felt that he}} laid his heart at her feet, the heart of a man of the world. She was kind to them all in her way, and insisted on their being friends together, in spite of a disposition to reciprocal criticism they displayed. Dangle thought Widgery a Philistine, appreciating but coarsely the merits of [...] "A Soul Untrammelled," [...] and Widgery thought Dangle lacked, humanity--would talk insincerely to say a clever thing. Both Dangle and Widgery thought Phipps a bit of a cub, and Phipps thought both Dangle and Widgery a couple of Thundering Bounders.|$|E
60|$|The {{others were}} {{similarly}} protected, {{and the fight}} would have ended in {{no more than a}} mauling all around, had not the mate, Walter Dakon, a very powerful man, hit upon the idea of ending the matter by tossing the mutineers overboard. This was joined in by Captain Nicholl, the surgeon, and myself, and in a trice five of the six were in the water and clinging to the gunwale. Captain Nicholl and the surgeon were busy amidships with the sixth, Jeremy Nalor, and were in the act of throwing him overboard, while the mate was occupied with rapping the <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> gunwale with a boat-stretcher. For the moment I had nothing to do, and so was able to observe the tragic end of the mate. As he lifted the stretcher to rap Seth Richards' fingers, the latter, sinking down low in the water and then jerking himself up by both hands, sprang half into the boat, locked his arms about the mate and, falling backward and outboard, dragged the mate with him. Doubtlessly he never relaxed his grip, and both drowned together.|$|E

50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{history of}} ASMR began on 19 October 2007 when a 21-year-old registered user of a discussion forum for health-related subjects at a website called 'Steady Health', with the username 'okaywhatever', submitted a post {{in which they}} described having experienced a specific sensation since childhood, comparable to that stimulated by tracing <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> skin, yet often triggered by seemingly random and unrelated non-haptic events, such as 'watching a puppet show' or 'being read a story'.|$|E

5000|$|A {{straight}} {{pitch is}} achieved by gripping the ball with the fingers across the wide part of the seam (called a [...] "four-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle fingers are touching two seams perpendicularly. A sinking fastball is thrown by gripping it across the narrow part (a [...] "two-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle fingers are along a seam.

60|$|But Mother Gunga {{would not}} fight as Peroo desired.

50|$|The 29 {{vertical}} poles {{correspond to}} the 29 Aboriginal clans from around Sydney. As the work is designed not to be viewed from a distance but experienced up close {{as part of the}} sensual and spatial encounter, the audience are invited to touch and run their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> engraved names and to feel the textures of the different materials. Walking between the pillars you hear a soundscape of Koori voices reciting the names of places in the Sydney region that have today been swallowed up by the metropolis. This is also a way to celebrate the moment in time.|$|E
50|$|The game {{carries on}} the {{gameplay}} of previous Katamari {{games in which}} players must roll a sticky ball, known as a Katamari, over hundreds of objects, allowing it to grow in size and reach a desired size within a time limit. However, this iteration adds new gameplay mechanics that makes use of the PlayStation Vita's features. Along with the analogue controls, players can move their fingers across the touch screen {{in order to move}} their Katamari in the desired direction. By moving <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> back touch panel, players can squash and stretch their Katamari, stretching it lengthways in order to roll over more objects or squashing it upwards to fit into tighter areas.|$|E
50|$|Tadoma is {{a method}} of {{communication}} used by deafblind individuals, in which the deafblind person places their thumb on the speaker's lips and their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> jawline. The middle three fingers often fall along the speaker's cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker's throat. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'tactile lipreading', as the deafblind person feels the movement of the lips, as well as vibrations of the vocal cords, puffing of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal sounds such as 'N' and 'M'. There are variations in the hand positioning, and it {{is a method}} sometimes used by people to support their remaining hearing.|$|E
