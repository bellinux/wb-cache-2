40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the powers}} of the Catalan Government to regulate and call popular consultations. Firstly, theoretical, historical and comparative arguments are given to explain why the Constitutional Court should make a broad interpretation of the Constitution and let the the Autonomous Communities move forward to a more participatory democracy. A doctrine of concurrent powers between the central government and the Catalan Government is outlined with regards to the regulation of referendary consultations (reserving their authorisation for the State) and the exclusive power of the Catalan Government to regulate and call non-referendary consultations. Thus, Catalan Law 4 / 2010 of “Consultes Populars per via de Referèndum” is defended as being constitutional. The authorisation of referendums by the central government is also discussed. It is highlighted the paradoxical situation of there being no material limits to the reform of the Spanish Constitution according to the Constitutional Court itself (even regarding the boundaries of the State or the recognition of a hypothetical right of secession) and the impossibility of consulting the people about questions requiring constitutional reform. Finally, the paper points out that the Article 87. 2 of the Constitution is the key to legitimate the juridical power of the Catalan governement to conduct a popular consultation regarding a new <b>fiscal</b> pact or <b>sovereignty...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{sovereignty}} {{is central to}} any international tax issue. While a nation is free to design its tax laws {{as it sees fit}} and raise revenue in accordance with the needs of its citizens, {{it is not possible to}} undertake such a task in isolation. In a world of cross-border investments and business transactions, all tax regimes impact on one another. Tax interactions between sovereign states cannot be avoided. Ultimately, the interactions mean that a nation must decide whether to engage in both collaboration and coordination with other nations and supranational bodies alike or maintain an individualised stance in relation to its tax policy. Whatever the decision, there is arguably an exercise in national sovereignty in some form. In the context of an international tax regime, whether that regime is interpreted broadly as meaning international norms generally adopted by nations around the world or domestic regimes legislating for cross-border transactions, rhetoric around national <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty</b> takes on many different forms. At one end of the spectrum it is relied upon by financial secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens) as a defence to their position on the basis that ‘other’ nations cannot interfere with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of a jurisdiction. At the other end of the spectrum, it is argued that profit shifting and international tax avoidance if not stopped is, in and of itself, a threat to a nation’s <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty</b> on the basis that it threatens the ability to tax and raise the revenue needed. This paper considers a modern conceptualisation of sovereignty along with its role within international tax coordination and collaboration to argue that a move towards a more unified approach to addressing international base erosion and profit shifting may be the ultimate exercise of national <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> By using the current transfer pricing regime as a case study, this paper posits that it is not merely enough to have international agreement on allocation rules to be applied, but that the ultimate exercise of national sovereignty is political agreement with other states to ensure that it is governments which determine the allocational basis of worldwide profits to be taxed. In doing so, it is demonstrated that the arm’s length pricing requirement of the current transfer pricing regime, rather than providing governments with the ability to determine the location of profits, is providing multinational entities with the ultimate power to determine that location. If left unchecked, this will eventually erode a nation’s ability to capture the required tax revenue and, as a consequence, may be deemed a failure by nation states to exercise their <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> ...|$|E

Em âmbito internacional, a soberania fiscal ou tributária reflete-se como capacidade plena de um Estado diante dos demais no cenário internacional. O Estado tem soberania fiscal quando edita suas leis, quando a sua vontade é a última a prevalecer quanto aos seus administrados, e a soberania fiscal ultrapassa o território do Estado, quando sua competência tributária alcança seus contribuintes onde quer que eles estejam. A aplicabilidade das normas constantes nos tratados decorre do postulado da soberania, como abordou-se acima, cujo conceito revela um caráter de supremacia, concernente ao poder jurídico, distinguindo-se da soberania do Estado dirigida a todos de seu território e nas relações recíprocas entre os Estados.

40|$|With the {{completion}} of the single European market and the full liberalization of capital markets two separate trilemmas emerged in the early 1990 s: a monetary trilemma between free capital movements, fixed exchange rates, and national monetary autonomy; and a financial trilemma between free capital movements, financial stability, and national financial supervision autonomy. The paper argues that although these two trilemmas stem from the same root cause, financial integration, the financial trilemma is particularly acute for countries that have chosen to resolve the monetary trilemma by entering into a monetary union.

The evolution of public finance theory went through many recurrences of the basic questions. During a 150 year period between the end of the 18 th century and the First World War no less than four schools of thought on public finance have emerged – the English, the French, the Italian and the German. These four schools presented different views on the three main issues of public finance: who is the state in relation with the individuals; which is the reason for paying taxes; what can a state do when it does not have enough resources.

40|$|Within the European Union, {{there exists}} a {{fundamental}} tension between the <b>fiscal</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of its Member States, in particular {{in the field of}} direct taxation, and the requirements of the Internal Market, which aim at the abolition of any regulatory or fiscal obstacles to cross border movement of goods, persons, services and capital. While the impact of secondary European legislation and state aid control is still rather limited, the judicature of the European Court of Justice on the fundamental freedoms has established substantial constraints for national legislators which force Member States to provide equal treatment for purely domestic and cross-border situations. This has a major effect with respect to the taxation of corporate groups as the legislator is obliged to extend benefits for domestic groups to multinational enterprises.
