2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|She had {{understood}} {{that she had}} to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls seemed to her to be [...] "as pure as crystal". A month spent with many priests taught her that they are [...] "weak and feeble men". [...] She wrote later: [...] "I met many saintly priests that month, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy." [...] For the first time too she had associated with young men. [...] "In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group [...] "developed a tender affection for her". Thérèse confessed to her sister, [...] "It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others." [...] Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant.|$|E

I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.|$|E

60|$|In {{one thing}} I was most agreeably disappointed. I {{had been told}} that the Christians of England were {{intolerant}} and unreasonable in their opinions on this subject; that they could not be made to understand the peculiar difficulties which beset it in America, and that they therefore made no distinction and no allowance in their censures. All this I found, so far as this circle were concerned, to be strikingly untrue. They appeared to be peculiarly affectionate in their feelings as regarded our country; to have the highest appreciation of, and the deepest sympathy with, our religious community, and to be extremely desirous to assist us in our difficulties. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> them remarkably well informed upon the subject.
