There is little to no local demand for products because commercially made equivalents are cheaper and often <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> <b>This</b> means that artisans are almost completely dependent on tourism to keep traditions alive. [...] The success of Oaxacan crafts has put strains on the availability of raw materials. One example of this is the over-exploitation of copal trees, whose soft wood is preferred by alebrije carvers.

To date, few handcraft products in all of Mexico have been eligible for certification to guarantee authenticity.|$|E

5000|$|Patch cords were expensive, {{could be}} damaged by use (creating hard-to-find {{intermittent}} faults), and made complex patches difficult and time-consuming to recreate. Thus, later analog synthesizers {{used the same}} building blocks, but integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems. The most popular of these was the Minimoog. In 1970, Moog designed an innovative synthesizer with a built-in keyboard and without modular design - the analog circuits were retained, but made interconnectable with switches in a simplified arrangement called [...] "normalization". Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> <b>This</b> first pre-patched synthesizer, the Minimoog, became highly popular, with over 12,000 units sold. [...] The Minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers, with integrated keyboard, pitch wheel and modulation wheel, and a VCO->VCF->VCA signal flow. In the 1970s, miniaturized solid-state components let manufacturers produce self-contained, portable instruments, which musicians soon began to use in live performances. Electronic synthesizers quickly become a standard part of the popular-music repertoire. The first movie to use music made with a (Moog) synthesizer was the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969. After {{the release of the}} film, composers produced a large number of movie soundtracks that featured synthesizers.|$|E
