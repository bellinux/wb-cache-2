In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on {{how long it will take}} to run without making an <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E

25|$|Other topics {{covered by}} Babylonian {{mathematics}} include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and {{the calculation of}} regular reciprocal pairs. The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear, quadratic equations and cubic equations, a remarkable achievement for the time. Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the Pythagorean theorem. However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness {{of the difference between}} exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> of the need for proofs or logical principles.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the common}} law {{provides}} no <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> of rights in a legal process, a number of principles combine to guarantee an individual {{a certain level of}} protection by law. These are often known as the rules of natural justice and comprise the principles nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem. A fair hearing implies that each party has the opportunity to present their own case to an impartial tribunal. Courts must generally sit in public and decisions may be challenged on the grounds of actual or apparent bias. Although judges are under a common law duty to give reasons for their decisions, there is no such rule for non-judicial decision-makers.|$|E
25|$|This is {{also the}} reason why the zeroth law of {{thermodynamics}} is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, A, B, and C are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, A can heat B and B can heat C and C can heat A. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is {{the reason why the}} zeroth law of thermodynamics needs <b>explicit</b> <b>statement.</b> That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.|$|E

500|$|Knox and Linderman {{were both}} {{personally}} familiar with mining {{conditions in the}} Far West. They knew {{that the amount of}} bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, [...] "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? [...] It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? [...] No one made an <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice William O. Douglas {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. In a 6-2 decision, the ruling of the U.S. Court of Claims was affirmed, ruling that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaty. Douglas noted that Public Law 280 had been enacted and was fully in force for approximately seven years before the Termination Act became effective. The section of that law that dealt with Wisconsin provided that hunting and fishing rights in [...] "Indian Country" [...] were protected from state regulation and action. Thus from 1954 until termination in 1961, the Menominee's hunting and fishing rights were not interfered with by Wisconsin. The Termination Act stated that all federal statutes dealing with the tribe were no longer in force, but Douglas noted that it was silent with regard to treaties. The act did not specifically address the hunting and fishing rights, and Douglas stated that the U.S. Supreme Court would [...] "decline to construe the Termination Act as a backhanded way of abrogating the hunting and fishing rights of these Indians." [...] He noted that in a similar bill for the Klamath Tribe, there was a discussion on paying the tribe to buy out their hunting and fishing rights, a clear indication that Congress was aware of the implications. Douglas found {{it hard to believe that}} Congress would subject the United States to a claim for compensation without an <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> to that effect. He found that without a specific abrogation of those rights, the tribe retained those rights.|$|E

2500|$|The degree Celsius is {{a special}} name for the kelvin for use in expressing Celsius temperatures. The degree Celsius is also {{subject to the same}} rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol. Thus, besides expressing {{specific}} temperatures along its scale (e.g. [...] "Gallium melts at 29.7646°C" [...] and [...] "The temperature outside is 23 degrees Celsius"), the degree Celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals: differences between temperatures or their uncertainties (e.g. [...] "The output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees Celsius", and [...] "Our standard uncertainty is ±3°C"). Because of this dual usage, one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval; it must be unambiguous through context or <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> that the quantity is an interval. This is sometimes solved by using the symbol °C (pronounced [...] "degrees Celsius") for a temperature, and C° (pronounced [...] "Celsius degrees") for a temperature interval, although this usage is non-standard.|$|E
