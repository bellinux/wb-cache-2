5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how closely it agrees with another similar instrument {{that has been}} validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how the veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E

5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

25|$|Most {{commentators}} divide Numbers {{into three}} sections based on locale (Mount Sinai, Kadesh-Barnea and {{the plains of}} Moab), linked by two travel sections; an alternative <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it as structured around the two generations of those condemned {{to die in the}} wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.|$|E

25|$|The Sierra Club's {{long-term}} goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the plovers taken {{off of the}} threatened species list. To accomplish this, they proposed year-round fencing to protect plover habitat, but the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area rejected the idea. Soon after the decision, a plover was killed by an off-road vehicle in a recommended area for fencing. The Sierra Club sued the State Parks for violating the ESA by not providing enough protection for the snowy plover, {{as well as the}} California least tern and steelhead trout.|$|E
25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E
5000|$|To {{make it an}} {{adjective}} with necessity, add -nuzxju. ex. vidit (see) - vidinuzxju (which needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen).</b> <b>To</b> make it an adverb with necessity, add -nuzxuo. ex. vidinuzxuo (with a need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen).</b> <b>To</b> make it a noun with necessity, add -nuzxost. ex. vidinuzxost (the need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen/need <b>to</b> <b>see</b> something).

25|$|One way to {{understand}} the motivation behind systems engineering <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it as a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within {{a wide variety of}} systems. Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al. can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided systems thinking is employed at all levels. Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics & communications require systems engineers as part of their team.|$|E
25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E

The group runs a trip boat, Birdswood, between Cromford Wharf and Leawood Pump House, although even after dredging of the section in 2013 it is quite shallow. English actor Brian Blessed is the president of Friends of the Cromford Canal.|$|E

25|$|The Iraqi Kurds {{may be seen}} in two ways. The {{first and}} the most common way is to view the Kurds as victims, both of the central {{government}} in Iraq and of neighbouring powers – particularly Turkey. The second opposing position <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them as an agent provocateur, acting as proxy forces for states opposed to the incumbent Iraqi regime. This polarised notion of their status may be too simplistic, when one considers that there are opposing agendas within Iraqi Kurdistan with regard to issues such as the relationship with Turkey, nationalist aspirations and relations globally.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher.

25|$|Activate is {{a network}} of young leaders in South Africa which aims {{to bring about change}} though {{creative}} solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.|$|E
