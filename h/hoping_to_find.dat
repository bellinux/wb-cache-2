David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.R.

He once drove from Canada to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a ride in an event, but he went empty-handed.

5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Rowley {{maintaining}} the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force {{consisted of the}} frigates Vénus and Manche with the corvette Victor. Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron. French lookouts on shore spotted Ceylon but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with Vénus and Victor.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739's {{designation}} is {{from the}} Henry Draper catalogue. The star was also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations {{that led to the}} discovery of the planet HD 205739 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 205739, the star was observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal-rich star; the N2K collaboration biased their search towards metal-rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a connection between a star's metallicity and its planets' masses.|$|E

5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer blows to the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as it came to be called, would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa.

Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. <b>Hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E

5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper floor, and the shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered.

5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows.

The player follows Safiya to the Veil Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Lienna, an acquaintance of Safiya’s mother, who is supposed to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player finds that the theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player finds that the spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats his spirit army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|In March 1801 Gibraltar {{took part}} in the pursuit of Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, whose {{squadron}} had made a further attempt to reinforce the French troops in Egypt. Having sailed from Brest on 7January, the French force of three 80-gun and four 74-gun ships-of-the-line, plus two frigates, passed into the Mediterranean on 9February, where it captured the only British ship in the area, the 32-gun frigate, Success. Rear-admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, comprising Gibraltar, the seventy-fours , , , , and the 64-gun Haerlem, on hearing of the event, set off in pursuit. Forced into Port Mahon on 27February by a storm, the squadron remained there for several days while repairs were undertaken. The search continued on 4March, minus Généreux, which was left to defend the island {{in the event of a}} surprise attack by French and Spanish forces. After Warren's squadron had visited Naples and Palermo, it received reinforcements on 18 and 22March in the form of the 64-gun Athénien and the 74-gun , respectively. Now, with seven ships-of-the-line, Warren turned towards Toulon, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Ganteaume there.|$|E
