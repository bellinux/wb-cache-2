5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; but then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> that in this design the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> {{that the}} DTM {{is only a}} model and cannot {{necessarily}} predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, {{as it has been}} shown that after a HDI of 0.9 the fertility increases again.|$|E
25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His touch is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E

"The {{instructions}} {{for the conduct of}} the strike required that in each community a revolutionary council would be set up with full authority over all workers' organizations, above all the Red Guard, which was to be the executive arm of the workers' power. The Red Guard would work with the militia in keeping order, mount guards and patrols, arrest dangerous enemies of the workers, confiscate liquor stocks, and stop the spread of rumors. The instruction ended with the standard injunction that 'during the general strike, order and discipline <b>must</b> <b>be</b> preserved irreproachably. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remember</b> that revolution <b>is</b> not the same as outrage and anarchy.'" ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty {{definite}} relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.|$|E

His magnum opus is the Systematic Theology (1871–1873), of 3 volumes and extending to 2,260 pages. His last book, What is Darwinism? appeared in 1874. In addition to all this <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that he contributed upward of 130 articles to the Princeton Review, many of which, besides exerting a powerful influence {{at the time of their}} publication, have since been gathered into volumes, and as Selection of Essays and Reviews from the Princeton Review (1857) and Discussions in Church Polity (ed. W. Durant, 1878) have taken a permanent place in theological literature.|$|E
25|$|Owen's {{detailed}} memoirs {{and descriptions}} require laborious attention in reading, {{on account of}} their complex terminology and ambiguous modes of expression. The fact that very little of his terminology has found universal favour causes {{them to be more}} generally neglected than they otherwise would be. At the same time, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that he was a pioneer in concise anatomical nomenclature and, so far at least as the vertebrate skeleton is concerned, his terms were based on a carefully reasoned philosophical scheme, which first clearly distinguished between the now-familiar phenomena of analogy and homology. Owen's theory of the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton (1848), subsequently illustrated also by his little work On the Nature of Limbs (1849), regarded the vertebrate frame as consisting of a series of fundamentally identical segments, each modified according to its position and functions. Much of it was fanciful and failed when tested by the facts of embryology, which Owen systematically ignored, throughout his work. However, though an imperfect and distorted view of certain great truths, it possessed a distinct value {{at the time of its}} conception.|$|E

25|$|Between 1918 and 1974, {{some older}} {{schools that are}} today {{integrated}} into the polytechnic subsector were industrial and commercial schools of vocational education, as well as intermediate schools for primary-education-teacher training, schools of agriculture, or nursing schools. Current establishments for polytechnic studies in engineering such as the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra, the nursing schools, and the current polytechnic schools of education (Escolas Superiores de Educação) during that period had no relation with higher education, and were known by other names. Admission to these schools was open to people with no complete secondary education, with universities reserved for secondary school graduates. For decades, these vocational schools of intermediate education (known as ensino médio) {{did not have the}} higher education status or credentials they have now. However, the majority of current polytechnical institutes was fully created in the 1980s and 1990s. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa and the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, both born from the earlier industrial institutes (Instituto Industrial), were higher education degree-conferring institutions in engineering during a short period before 1919, and were known by other institutional names in their long histories.|$|E
500|$|According to Russell Kirk, [...] "Nor is it {{possible}} to appreciate Eliotwhether or not one agrees with himif one comes to Four Quartets with ideological blinders. Ideology, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> is the attempt to supplant religious dogmas by political and scientistic dogmas. If one's first premise is that religion must be a snare and a delusion, for instance, then it follows that Eliot becomes an enemy to be assaulted, rather than a pilgrim whose journal one may admire-even if one does not believe in the goal of that quest." ...|$|E

In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.|$|E

As a teacher he had few equals; and if he did not display popular gifts in the pulpit, he revealed homiletic powers of a high order in the [...] "conferences" [...] on Sabbath afternoons, where he spoke with his accustomed clearness and logical precision, but with great spontaneity and amazing tenderness and unction.|$|E
