40|$|The {{provision}} of quality, affordable housing {{is vital for}} our communities and country. The current housing shortage, and lack of quality, affordable housing in Auckland provides {{the foundation for the}} relevant and significant inquiry. The intensification of land within the city boundaries through infill development, the implementation of prefabricated construction methods for improved construction efficiency and productivity, and the exploration of smaller, more efficiently designed dwellings; are three ways identified and examined as methods to increase the supply of quality, affordable housing. The review and analysis of literature and precedent outlined the many benefits of prefabrication in the {{provision of}} quality, affordable housing, and it’s greatest defeat in the limitations that are typically addressed through site-specific design. Recent literature has identified the hybrid, panel + module typology of prefabrication, largely unexplored in New Zealand, to have the greatest potential to incorporate responsive, site- specific design, for better architectural outcome, with the efficiencies that prefabrication has been proven to provide. The development of the hybrid system for application to a unique infill, social housing programme, with diverse and wide-ranging site conditions, provides the constraints and requirements of the inquiry. The design process documented provides a model to the methods and considerations required {{in the development of a}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> for quality, site specific, affordable, infill housing in Auckland...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand is {{currently}} experiencing a housing shortage. The economical recession {{has also had}} implications on housing affordability {{and as a result}} more people are relying on the government to help meet their housing needs. The government have given Housing New Zealand Corporation a target of increasing their housing stock to 70, 194 by 2012. This is an increase of five percent. There is also a need to revitalise the housing stock. Over seventy percent of the houses were built before the 1980 s and the stock is dated, cold and often mouldy. This project proposes a <b>hybrid</b> <b>prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> to enable Hosing New Zealand Corporation to efficiently provide quality housing. Throughout time a one size fits all approach has been applied to state housing. There has been a Europe¬an perspective in housing, Polynesians, Maori make up the majority of state house tenants with the other ethnici¬ties including Asians and Middle Eastern. A survey of past and current models shows the flaws in their design. In order to meet the diverse needs of tenants, it is necessary to go beyond the current approach to state housing with prototype houses that were placed repeatedly within a site. This project does not intend on experimenting on the poor but instead apply a collaboration of proven techniques in terms of both design and construction. The answer to the problem is a flexible system consisting of a concrete service core and a library of timber framed wall panels that can be applied to a pre-fabricated floor panel. This system is suitable for sites throughout the country as it can be reconfigured to suit each individual site and orientation. It can also be configured in multiple ways to create variations suited to the different family dynamics of the Housing New Zealand tenants. The system is an efficient solution, minimising time on site and able to be produced in bulk. The solution demonstrates and showcases emerging trends in housing and is able to show Housing New Zealand Corporation and other housing agencies a new approach to the housing shortage solution. The proposed solution can improve the standard of state housing, minimise the health issues associated with state housing and provide a better home for members of our community. Quality and quantity can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} used {{extensively}} in many developed and developing countries to provide low cost housing. There are many case studies that took the advantage of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> as part of self help approach in house construction. It showed that in certain situation, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> in self help housing proved to be cost effective, provide employment opportunities, utilise low skill levels and maximise local natural resources. Malaysia, {{being one of the}} developing countries, is also promoting <b>prefabricated</b> <b>system</b> to be used in low cost housing provision. There are obstacles to implement such technology into the conventional construction industry that has been employed for years. This paper investigates the possibility of adapting local resources into prefabricated components as a mean to promote not only modular coordination concept but also promote self build approach among the community at a lower skill labour. It is not an immediate solution to housing issues yet it provides alternatives to house the low income group and contribute to increase the supply of housing...|$|R

40|$|Buildings are static {{elements}} in a dynamic environment characterized by fast changing needs and evolving environmental, social, and economic standards. Thus, today challenge for structural design through Design for Adaptability and Deconstruction (DfAD) is to create buildings that are flexible enough to answer these needs. This thesis analyses DfAD for building structures and presents three case studies: a tent, a structure with <b>prefabricated</b> panellised <b>systems,</b> and a container building. The key arguments that justify DfAD are the negative environmental impact of the current structures; {{the life cycle of}} a building; the changes expected from buildings; and the cost incentive of this design. DfAD is a combination of design approaches that deal with the different scales of a structure.

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the modern environmental, {{economic}} and social issues, urban densification appears as one of the possible solutions to limit land consumption, infrastructure and transport costs, to increase quality of life and to promote a more efficient use of energy in metropolitan areas. Since ancient times the addition of new volumes to the existing building has been adopted as an ordinary practice to respond to the changing needs of the inhabitants. Today rooftop architecture can be used to intensify the existing metropolitan areas, inject them with new vitality and diversify the mono-functionality of a neighbourhood. Besides, it represents an opportunity for the energy upgrading of the built environment since the exploitation of rooftop space as open available area where to erect new structures not only allows for land consumption control but also it often entails the requalification of the roofing construction. Moreover the addition of new inhabitable spaces can be part of a governmental or municipal energy incentive policy to trigger private initiatives towards refurbishment and requalification projects aimed at improving the overall energy efficiency of the ‘supporting’ existing buildings.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} detailing joints between manual and digital construction by tracking the provocations of KieranTimberlakeis SmartWrap research {{and the evolution of}} that knowledge into practical architectural instruments that can be deployed into more traditional construction projects. Over the past several years, KieranTimberlake Associates in Philadelphia has undertaken a path of research focusing on problems of contemporary construction systems and practices. One product of this research was a speculative wall system assembled for a museum exhibit. SmartWrap was to be a digitally <b>prefabricated</b> wall <b>system</b> with embedded technology.  While they have yet to wrap a building with SmartWrap, KieranTimberlake have utilized a number of the construction principles and digital tools tested in the SmartWrap exhibit. One of the most important principles, prefabrication, was explored in a fast-track construction project at the Sidwell Friends School. The compressed schedule drove the design of an enclosure system which incorporated performative elements in similar categories to SmartWrap: insulation, an electrical system, view, daylighting, and a rainscreen. Besides being a <b>prefabricated</b> façade <b>system,</b> the rainscreen detailing became a formal system for organizing many other scales of the project including: site systems, thermal systems, daylighting systems, enclosure, and ornament. At a second project, a similar wood rainscreen strategy was used. However, at the Loblolly House the question of prefabrication and digital modelling was tested far more extensively: thermal systems were embedded into prefabricated floor cartridges, entire program elements - a library, kitchen, and bathroom were proposed as <b>prefabricated</b> <b>systems</b> of self-contained volume and infrastructure which were then inserted into the on-site framework., In all three projects the joint between manual-imprecise construction and digital-precise prefabrication became the area of richest invention (Figure 1).
