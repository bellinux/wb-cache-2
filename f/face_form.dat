40|$|International audienceA {{critical}} analysis of some basic notions often overlooked in crystallographic education is presented to correct some common oversights occurring both in the literature and in textbooks. The crystal <b>forms</b> (<b>face</b> <b>forms),</b> {{defined in terms of}} their geometric eigensymmetry, are 47 in number, not 48 as often found in the literature. The split of the dihedron into dome and sphenoid calls for the consideration of the physical properties of the faces building a form; in that case, however, the same criterion should be used for all forms. By taking the handedness of the faces as representative of the physical properties of the faces, the occurrence of 128 crystallographic <b>face</b> <b>forms</b> (97 affine <b>face</b> <b>forms</b> and 31 enantiomorphic pairs) is demonstrated. Next, the correct use of non-coprime Miller indices when a centred unit cell is adopted is shown, and the inconsistent multiplication of Miller indices in the Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker law is pointed out. A geometric derivation of the reflection conditions is reviewed. Finally, the inconsistent presentation of metric restrictions imposed by the structural symmetry is pointed out and corrected...|$|R

As an application, we show that all boron–nitrogen (B–N) fullerene graphs are 2 -resonant, and construct all the 3 -resonant B–N fullerene graphs, which are all k-resonant for any positive integer k. Here a B–N fullerene graph is a plane cubic graph with only square and hexagonal faces, and a B–N fullerene graph is k-resonant if any i(0 ⩽i⩽k) disjoint <b>faces</b> <b>form</b> a resonant pattern.

40|$|The atomic {{structure}} and morphology of ultrathin Pb layers deposited on the Ni 3 Al(1 1 1) face in ultrahigh vacuum at the substrate temperature, ranging from 200 K to 950 K, were investigated {{with the use}} of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and directional elastic peak electron spectroscopy (DEPES). The analysis of AES measurements indicates that two-dimensional growth of the first Pb monolayer ‘wetting layer’ takes place for substrate temperature 200 K ≤ T ≤ 650 K. For T = 200 K, lead on the Ni 3 Al(1 1 1) grows layer-by-layer, while for T = 300 K flat three atomic-layer-high islands seem to grow after the completion of the first lead monolayer. Above 350 K, the Stranski–Krastanov growth mode is observed. The ordered LEED patterns corresponding to p(4 × 4) and p(√ 3 × √ 3) R 30 ° structures are observed.

In non-static scenes, hair behaviour {{is just as important}} as its looks. Principles of physics and dynamic simulation are often used for animating hair, because other traditional animation approaches-such as skeletal animation or motion capture-are difficult to apply to hair. Dynamic animation of hair is still an open problem without a known best solution, because hair has quite specific mechanical properties which, combined with the high number of hairs typically comprising a hairstyle, make realistic and efficient simulation challenging. In this work, we focus on dynamic hair animation methods capable of provid- ing real-time or interactive performance while staying physically plausible. Basing on research and analysis of hair properties from the cosmetic industry, we have devised a novel hair animation method which provides more realistic results than existing comparable methods while at the same time offering better performance and stability. We have applied this method to two different approaches to hair animation in order to prove its independence on any particular representation of hair. In one of these approaches, our method allows us to replace an [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{single-crystal}} 4 H silicon carbide is decomposed by annealing in ultra-high vacuum conditions, forming a surface layer {{consisting of a}} few atomic layers of graphitic carbon (graphene) arranged in known crystallographic register with the substrate material. The layers of graphene on the (0001) <b>face</b> <b>form</b> {{the subject of the}} thesis, and their surface morphology, crystallography and electronic transport properties are investigated in order to gain insight into the growth process with a view to improving the quality of the graphene (assessed in terms of lateral grain size, and coherence of electronic transport). Graphene quality is improved following changes to the annealing procedure based on understanding of growth mechanisms, and the resulting material is characterised using a range of surface-sensitive techniques as well as extensive analysis of electronic transport phenomena. Comparisons made between the graphene produced by the initial and improved processes indicate an order of magnitude increase in structural coherence {{as a result of the}} changes made, with associated improvements in electronic characteristics. Magnetotransport measurements are presented which demonstrate the two-dimensional nature of the material. These can also be used to extract values for rates associated with the various scattering mechanisms present, which in turn give insight into the electronic coherence, linking this with the physical properties. Consideration of electronelectron interaction effects is required in order to fully explain the magnetotransport behaviour seen. Detailed consideration of surface properties seen at intermediate stages in the decomposition process (including a previously unreported surface reconstruction) is used to suggest a change to established growth procedures which if successful has the potential to further improve the quality of material.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-examine Leon Williams {{geometric}} theory and to find the degree of correspondence between the face and the tooth form in the population of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two thousand individuals with intact frontal teeth, in age between 17 and 24 years, were measured for 3 horizontal distances on the face: temporal width (Ft-Ft), zygomatic width (Zyg-Zyg) and gonial width (Go-Go) and for 3 horizontal distances on the both upper incisors: cervical width (CW), contact point width (CPW) and incisal width (IW). The length of the face (Tr-Gn) as well as the length of the central maxillary incisors were also measured. The results revealed: 1. Men had significantly larger dimensions for all facial and tooth dimensions (p 0. 05); the left and the right central incisors were of identical dimensions and forms (p > 0. 05). 2. The width of upper central incisors were smaller approximately 1. 5 mm than in west Europeans. 3. Upon the relation between the 3 horizontal dimensions measured on the face and upper maxillary incisor, 11 facial forms and 10 upper central tooth forms could be recognised in the study population, but 98 % of the population had only 3 tooth and face forms. Face shapes: oval face – 83. 3 %, square-tapered face – 9. 2 % and tapered face – 7 %; tooth forms: tapered-square incisor – 53 %, oval incisor – 30 %, tappered incisor – 16 %. 4. Reversed and enlarged tooth form was in line associated with the facial form in only 30 %, while the most common combination was of the oval <b>face</b> <b>form</b> and the tapered-square central incisor (45 %). 5.
