40|$|In {{the field}} of {{insolvency}} law, the transaction avoidance regime protects creditors from improper actions of insolvent debtors. There is however increasing public awareness that the solvency of small business creditors may be stretched by actions of their larger debtors. This undermines governmental measures to support small businesses. It also has negative implications for the transaction avoidance regime, which has undergone expansion through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 reforms. The value of these reforms is deflated where small businesses have entered administration/liquidation because their finances have been overborne by the trading practices of larger partners, and <b>established</b> <b>insolvency</b> law remedies for overturning transactions cannot be invoked to return any lost value to the estate. The absence of such remedies, together with the weakness of other mechanisms relied on {{for the protection of}} smaller businesses, lead this paper to propose that tenets of transaction avoidance law offer a route to discerning circumstances in which contractual arrangements with large counterparties should be unravelled in the interests of strengthening the protection of small businesses...|$|E

50|$|While the BIA {{provides}} that a creditor can only petition a debtor into bankruptcy only where {{the latter has}} committed an act of bankruptcy, the WURA {{provides that}} a debtor who fails to settle a demand served by a creditor within 60 days is deemed to have committed an act of insolvency and can thus be petitioned immediately into a winding-up proceeding.

But having established that, the burden of proof then switched to the directors to establish the minimising loss defence, if applicable. The court rejected academic sources which suggested that the burden of proof was also on the liquidators to disprove the defence, and followed the High Court decision of Ms Lesley Anderson QC in [...] at 113.|$|R

30|$|Until very recently, in Spain the {{insolvency}} procedures {{available for}} self-employed individuals and entrepreneurs (i.e., managers/owners of small firms) were {{governed by the}} same rules than {{in the case of}} large businesses such as a limited liability companies. In September 2013 the Spanish Parliament approved a law that will create some sort of special bankruptcy regime for them. 64 The law contemplates introducing some limitation of the liability of the entrepreneur / self-employed individual through the new figure of entrepreneur with limited liability (emprendedor de responsabilidad limitada). This figure will allow that part of the assets of the entrepreneur will be exempted in case of insolvency, namely EUR 300, 000 invested in its primary residence. The law also introduces a partial “fresh start”: the entrepreneur will be discharged of her pre-bankruptcy debts as longs as she pays in full the preferential, secured and privileged credit and at least a 25  % of the ordinary credit. 65 Finally, the law <b>establishes</b> a new <b>insolvency</b> procedure, the acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos, an extrajudicial debt workout coordinated by a public mediator. If no agreement is reached between the debtor and her creditors, a judicial bankruptcy procedure (concurso consecutivo) will follow, but the negotiation attempt will increase the fresh start: no ordinary credit will have to be reimbursed.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} credit {{insurance}} in the 1980 law Ley de Contrato de Seguro (L. C. S.) (Insurance Contract) refers to insolvency insurance or to credit insurance in the strictest sense regarding the creditor's wish of protection from a debtor's insolvency, by {{searching for the}} cover of an underwriter. lf the initial intention was to prevent the insolvency of the underwriters themselves, it is now concerned with the prevention of the insured's debtor's insolvency. This protection is sought in the current absence of technical mechanisms and regulations {{for the protection of}} the insured, and derives from the imposition on the underwriter of the required solvency to guarantee indemnity payments, should these arise. But control of underwriters is now regulated by the 1995 law on private insurance regulation and supervision in accordance with European Community Directives. The L. C. S. is. regulated an insurance contract of the insured's cover against the debtor's definitive insolvency. This contrasts with security or surety insurance, in which the risk covered is that of the insured's debtor failure to comply. Insolvency lies at the heart of credit insurance but it is difficult to determine what insolvency is, particularly when there is no legal definition of the termo The L. C. S. does not define it: "For insurance credit, the underwriter is obliged, within the limits established by the law and in the contract, to indemnify the insured for ultimate losses that may arise as a consequence of the definitive insolvency of his or her debtors. " It refers to definite insolvency as a risk in the technical insurable sense without specifying what such a risk consists of and merely gives hypothetical situations. These indicate the debtor's definitive <b>insolvency</b> <b>established</b> "When the debtor has been declared bankrupt through a final judicial resolution. " This raises the question of knowing whether, within bankruptcy, it is necessary also to consider a commercial debtor's other economic crises such as temporary receivership, and to include the crisis situation of a civil (i. e. non-commercial) debtor, with the civil creditors' meeting or bankruptcy proceedings. The L. C. S. also considers definitive <b>insolvency</b> <b>established</b> "When an agreement of amount acquittance [an arrangement with creditors] has been judicially approved and endorsed. " Here debtor and creditors agree on a reduction of the sum owed. Also, "When a court order or writ of execution has been served, and the resulting seizure has yielded insufficient free assets to cover the payment in question. " An unsuccessful execution of writ or order means that the insufficiency of the debtor's assets required to cover the amount owed is considered a loss or writeoff, without judicial declaration of bankruptcy. Finally "When the policy holder and underwriter, in mutual agreement, consider the amount owed to be irrecoverable. " Without denying that this rule may only infrequently be efficient, it basically complies with the function of closing and is not juridically capricious, but solves the difficulty in contending loss in relation to other hypothetical situations concerning the risk of definitive insolvency...|$|R
40|$|The study aims {{to present}} {{relevant}} aspects from the jurisprudential solutions of the High Court of Cassation and Justice {{in matters of}} the action in annulment of the patrimonial transfers of the debtor in insolvency procedure and of other judicial actions introduced by the procedure bodies or, by case, the participants to the procedure who are enabled to use the measures prescribed by the law {{for the purpose of}} restoring the debtor’s patrimony. The jurisprudential solutions adopted under the incidence of the former Law no. 85 / 2006 on the insolvency procedure represent, in present, under diverse aspects, elements of continuity with the principles and rules established by the new law in this matter.

The new law continues the tradition of the former regulations in this matter but, also, brings some novelty elements such as the decrease or, in some cases, the increase of the duration of certain terms that the exertion of the mentioned judicial actions or their object refer to or the completion of the category of the persons entitled to introduce the mentioned judicial actions with the creditor who holds more than 50 % {{of the value of the}} claims enlisted in the amount of claims...|$|R
40|$|In 2006, the American Law Institute (ALI) and the International <b>Insolvency</b> Institute (III) <b>established</b> a Transnational <b>Insolvency</b> Project and {{appointed}} Professor Ian Fletcher (United Kingdom) and Professor Bob Wessels (Netherlands) as Joint Reporters. The {{objective was to}} investigate whether the essential provisions of the ALI Principles of Cooperation among the NAFTA Countries (ALI-NAFTA Principles) and the annexed Guidelines Applicable to Court-to-Court Communication in Cross-border Cases (ALI-NAFTA Guidelines) may, with certain necessary modifications, be acceptable for use by jurisdictions across the world. In 2012, Professor Fletcher and Professor Wessels presented the report Transnational Insolvency: Global Principles for Cooperation in International Insolvency Cases (“ALI-III Report”) to the Annual Meetings of the American Law Institute and the International Insolvency Institute. In 2013, the Australian Academy of Law (AAL) provided support to the authors to undertake research on the possible benefits for Australia of courts and insolvency administrators of referring to the ALI-III Report when addressing international insolvency cases. This AAL project was {{at the request of}} the Council of Chief Justices of Australia and New Zealand. This research Report compares the Global Principles for Cooperation in International Insolvency Cases with the Cross-border Insolvency Act 2008 and the UNCITRAL Model Law as it has been adopted and has force of law in Australia. Further, it examines the Global Guidelines for Court-to-Court Communications in International Insolvency Cases in light of Australian cross-border insolvency and procedural law. Finally, it makes brief reference to and commentary on the Global Rules on Conflict–of-Laws Matters in International Insolvency Cases annexed to the ALI-III Report from the perspective of Australian choice of law rules...|$|R
