5|$|On November 7, 2009, a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> {{featuring}} {{the public option}} was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House {{by a vote of}} 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill.</b> The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> {{was too long}} and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the Public Option Act (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a four-page bill that would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States {{to buy into the}} public Medicare program at cost.

In mid-November, it was reported that 40 House Democrats said they will not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions. Stupak has said that 15–20 Democrats will oppose adoption of the Senate bill because of objections to its abortion provisions as well as its tax on high-value health insurance plans.

After a series of court decisions and appeals, on September 8, 2011 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in a decision issued by Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, overturned Judge Hudson's decision on the basis that Virginia lacked subject-matter jurisdiction—Virginia could not pass a law to supersede or nullify a federal law.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the activities and influence of public health interest groups and coalitions on the national <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform debates in the 103 rd Congress. METHODS: Congressional staff and representatives of public health interest groups, coalitions, and government health agencies were interviewed. Content analysis of eight leading national <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform <b>bills</b> was performed. RESULTS: The public health community coalesced around public <b>health</b> in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform; nearly all the major interest groups and government health agencies joined two or more public health or prevention coalitions, and half joined three or more. The most effective influence on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform legislation was early, sustained personal contact with Congress members and their staffs, accompanied by succinct written materials summarizing key points. Media campaigns and grassroots mobilization were less effective. Seven of the eight leading <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform <b>bills</b> included {{one or more of}} the priorities supported by public health advocates. CONCLUSIONS: The public health community played an important role in increasing awareness and support for public health programs in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform <b>bills</b> of the 103 rd Congress...|$|R
