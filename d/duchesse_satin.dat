Designed by Lindka Cierach, the beadwork incorporated various symbols including hearts representing romance, anchors and waves representing Prince Andrew's sailing background and bumblebees and thistles, which {{were taken from}} Sarah Ferguson's family crest. Copies of the dress, including the motifs specific to the royal family, went on sale in stores just hours {{after the end of}} the wedding.Influenced by the wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer, a notable feature of Sarah Ferguson's 17 foot long train was the intertwined initials A and S sewn in silver beads. The head-dress and bouquet, fabric rosettes or artificial silk flowers were used to adorn the gown itself. [...] Ferguson was pleased with the dress, describing it in her 1997 memoir, My Story, as [...] "an exquisite creation I'd lost twenty-six pounds to fit into. Lindka was a genius; I knew she could make the most flattering gown ever, and she had. It was amazingly boned, like a corset."Hair stylist Denise McAdam and make-up artist Teresa Fairminer attended to the bride, while florist Jane Packer designed the bouquet. The ivory silk wedding dress became the season's most sought-after style.|$|E
