40|$|Nowadays, hop is used almost {{exclusively}} by brewers for bitterness and flavor. Although hop polyphenols {{have been widely}} studied {{in the past decade}} for their antioxidant activity in the boiling kettle, very little is known about their real impact on health. The discovery of resveratrol in <b>hop</b> <b>pellets</b> highlights the potential health-promoting effect of moderate beer consumption. Here, we have optimized a quantitative extraction procedure for resveratrol in <b>hop</b> <b>pellets.</b> Preliminary removal of hydrophobic bitter compounds with toluene and cyclohexane at room temperature allows 99 % trans-resveratrol recovery by ethanol:water (75 : 25, v/v) solid/liquid extraction at 60 degrees C.

40|$|If {{a certain}} type of beer is to be brewed with a strong hop aroma and a {{corresponding}} mild bitterness,the latter is difficult to be kept on a low level. Using for example <b>hop</b> <b>pellets,</b> with every <b>hop</b> dosage aroma as well as bitter compounds are transferred. When brewing beers with pronounced aroma and mild bitterness, the hop industry normally recommends the use of so-called “advanced products”,where aroma and bitter substances are separated and each of them can be custom dosed.

Brewing trials have been conducted in which <b>hop</b> <b>pellets</b> of different varieties were used at mid and end of boiling as well as for dry hopping in different combinations in lager type beer.

Compared with the use of nonisomerized hop extract, significantly higher isomerization yields were obtained when vegetative material was included in the hopping. However, when vegetative material was present final alpha-acids utilization was compromised by large losses of iso-alpha-acids postboiling. Evidence of reverse isomerization of iso-alpha-acids during wort boiling was not found when preisomerized hop extract was applied. The results obtained using quantitative HPLC profiling confirmed that both alpha-acids and iso-alpha-acids were not stable upon beer aging. In particular, trans-iso-alpha-acids underwent rapid degradation in finished beer.

40|$|Since lipid {{auto-oxidation}} during wort boiling is a determining for {{the appearance}} of staling flavour in aged beers, we have investigated the reducing power of hops added in the boiling kettle. An assay based on the inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation {{in the presence of}} an initiator [2, 2 '-azobis(2 -amidino-propane) dihydrochloride = AAPH] enabled us to distinguish hop varieties and conditionings. Large differences in hop flavanoid contents explained the higher antioxidant activity of low-cr-acid samples versus bitter varieties and CO 2 hop extracts. As expected, adding <b>hop</b> <b>pellets</b> to the kettle effectively increased the overall reducing activity of wort. Supercritical CO 2 hop extracts had no significant effect due to their extremely low level of polyphenols. The concentration of the very well-known marker of beer ageing, trans- 2 -nonenal, was lower in boiled wort exhibiting a better reducing power. The AAPH reducing power test applied to hops or worts was thus efficient to predict the nonenal synthesis during boiling. Hop varieties and conditionings emerged from this work as key-parameters for improving the reducing power of wort and the flavour stability of the final product. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 28 th International Symposium on Chromatography celebrado en Valencia (España) del 12 al 16 de septiembre de 2010. Hops (Humulus lupulus sp) {{contain a}} wide range of {{compounds}} with different properties and activities, among them are the prenylated flavonoids such as the Xanthohumol (XN) and Isoxanthohumol (IXN). In aqueous medium XN it’s isomerized to IXN, who produce 8 -prenilnaringenin (8 PN) by the action of gut microbiota. It’s raising the interest in 8 PN by its functional properties: potential estrogen only about 1000 times less than estradiol with ability to bind to both receptors, ERα and ERβ (Zanoli and Zavati, 2008). The first step to get 8 PN is by isolation of its precursor: IXN (or XN in either case). <b>Hop</b> <b>pellets</b> (normally used for animal feed) were used for the extraction by two methods: -Solid-liquid extraction to determine the initial amount of both compounds: cryogenically crushed hops mixed with DMSO, and left in agitation and darkness 24 hours. It is filtered and the cake obtained again underwent the same process. This was repeated until no XN nor IXN were detected in the filtrate. -Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) hop powder mixed with sea sand (1 : 2 ratio) were extracted using following conditions: water at 150 º C (6 cycles of 5 minutes), ethanol at 150 ° C (6 cycles of 5 minutes), sequential extraction (hexane followed by ethanol and finally water; 20 minutes each fraction). All samples were evaporated and/or freeze dried. In order to have an idea of the amount of total phenols extract, Folin-Ciocalteu method was used, as described by Kosar et al (2004). Extracts obtained by both methods was analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (triple quadrupole). Multiple reactions monitoring analysis was carried out for quantification. In this sense, direct infusion of standards (XN, IXN and 8 PN) was used to optimize MS transitions and voltages. Moreover two full scan analysis simultaneously, with and without source fragmentation. The results indicated that there was a considerable amount of XN in hops (around 50 mg/g hops). The pressurized water extraction at 150 ºC showed a high selectivity towards IXN (10 times more than XN) that reflects the isomerization described previously (Stevens and Page, 2004), while ethanol was more selective to extract XN, because no isomerization took place. In hexane and water fractions of sequential extraction the amount of XN and IXN was not relevant (less than 0. 40 mg/g extract) although it is in ethanol (that is where more of both substances extracted, however there is no selectivity). The next step would be to conduct trials of digestion and bioavailability of the extracts of interest, to determinate the synthesis yield of 8 PN from our extracts. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether storage temperature or hopping method had influence on the aroma and bitterness in beer. The focus was set on the aroma that comes from hops, and not from yeast. The secondary objective to this study was to explore the development of the alcohol, CO 2 and bitterness in the beer after priming and bottling. The thesis’ main perspective is that of home brewers, and to some extent that of microbreweries. Beer was brewed with 100 % pilsner malt and hopped with Cascade and Vic Secret <b>hop</b> <b>pellets.</b> Cascade was used both for bittering and for aroma. Vic Secret was only used for aroma. Three batches of beer were brewed two times. The beer was brewed in the 60 L brewery in the Pilot plant at NMBU. All three batches were boiled for 90 minutes. The same amount of Cascade hops were added to all three batches for bittering for 60 and 30 minutes boiling time. Aroma hops were added to brews 1 and 4 for 5 minutes, and to brews 2 and 6 at 80 °C post boiling. Aroma hops were added to brews 3 and 6 (dry hopping) on the day of racking into the secondary fermenter. After bottling, half of the bottles were stored at 4 °C and the other half were stored at room temperature. This process was repeated once ending with a total of six batches where batches 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6 have undergone the same treatment. Six brews and two different storage temperatures resulted in 12 bottles to be tested seven times over the course of two months. At day 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 after bottling samples were gathered. Aroma was measured in the beers stored at both temperatures using GC-MS. The GC-MS resulted in detection of typical hop and yeast aromas, however a clear pattern in the development of the aromas could not be found. CO 2, percent alcohol, color and haze were measured on the test days using the Anton Paar Alcolyzer. The development of the alcohol and CO 2 increased fast the first 5 days after bottling and then seemed to stabilize after day 20. Color and haze both decreased during storage, the storage temperature did not have a significant effect on these. Bitterness was measured using UV spectrophotometry. The bitterness kept fluctuating between 40 and 60 IBUs after bottling, suggesting that development of bitterness is not set by the calculated bitterness and the amount of bittering hops added. Sensory evaluation was executed on days 30 and 60 after bottling.

5000|$|A hopback is a {{traditional}} additional chamber {{that acts as a}} sieve or filter by using whole hops to clear debris (or [...] "trub") from the unfermented (or [...] "green") wort, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase hop aroma in the finished beer. It is a chamber between the brewing kettle and wort chiller. Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber. Hopbacks utilizing a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed.

40|$|Hops {{constitute}} an indispensable {{raw material for}} beer production. The hop essential oil (-derived) volatiles are at {{the origin of the}} highly desired hoppy aroma of beer. (Bio) chemical transformations and losses during the brewing process alter the hop oil volatile fingerprint, resulting in hoppy aroma in beer that is clearly different from the aroma of the hops. Nevertheless, the nature of hoppy aroma is up-to-date far from understood. Especially ‘noble kettle hop’ aroma, which is a typical flavour characteristic of traditional Pilsner-type beers obtained by vigorous boiling of aroma hops, has been a matter of debate and knowledge concerning this controversial issue remains contradictory and fragmentary. This PhD study aims at providing scientific insights into the impact of the boiling process on the analytical and sensory characteristics of hop essential oil volatiles. Such knowledge is of utmost importance to completely understand the chemical background of ‘kettle hop’ aroma. In first instance, a literature overview on hops, hop aroma, (bio) chemical transformations of hop oil volatiles during the brewing process and hoppy aroma of beer is presented. In order to obtain scientific insights on changes in the hop oil volatile profile upon boiling, lab scale boiling experiments (in water) with total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) were conducted. HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis and multivariate data analysis (PCA, CA) revealed clustering between unboiled and boiled hop essential oil samples, due to decreases in terpene hydrocarbon levels and an increase in the level of particular α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation and hydrolysis products upon boiling. Also a series of volatiles specific for boiled hop oil could be observed, pointing to de novo generation of volatiles {{as a result of the}} boiling process. Sensory evaluations of boiled hop essential oil in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated that boiled hop oil imparts ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions and ‘kettle hop’ aroma to beer. Seen the interesting flavour characteristics (spicy, herbal notes) of boiled hop essential oil, the search for hop oil volatiles involved in this flavour impression was further focused by SPE fractionation of boiled hop essential oil. Fractions expressing ‘spicy’ and ‘hoppy’ notes when spiked to water were subjected to comprehensive analytical profiling via HS-SPME-GC-MS. Comparison of the boiled hop oil fractions with the corresponding unboiled hop oil fractions allowed for identification of additional volatiles formed de novo during the boiling process. Sensory evaluation of hop oil fractions in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer suggested that fractions containing high oxygenated sesquiterpenoid levels are most relevant in relation to ‘kettle hop’ aroma. Moreover, an SPE methodology was developed to enrich oxygenated sesquiterpenoids from commercial kettle hopped lager beers. Many compounds formed de novo upon lab scale boiling of hop oil (cv. Saaz) were detected in the commercial beers. Moreover, GC-O analysis demonstrated that several α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation products elute in flavour-active zones of the hop oil-derived fractions as well as in the fractions derived from a commercial lager beer. Enrichment of a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction from total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) and subsequent lab scale boiling of this fraction unambiguously proved oxidation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Moreover, SPE isolation of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo and addition of this fraction to non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship between these constituents and ‘spicy/kettle hop’ flavour. Via GC-O analysis of the oxidation product fraction, two intervals with significant odour-activity were established. Humulene epoxide III, humulenol II, caryophylla- 4 (12), 8 (13) -diene- 5 α/β-ol, (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 α-ol, 14 -hydroxy-β-caryophyllene and (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 β-ol were identified in these intervals and since except for humulene epoxide III all these oxidation products were also found in flavour-active zones of a commercial kettle hopped lager beer, these volatiles are candidate key impact compounds for ‘kettle hop’ aroma. By boiling increasing hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) concentrations in both water and wort, a positive correlation between the initial hop oil concentration and formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products upon boiling was found. Varietal aspects were also investigated (cv. Saaz, cv. Hallertau Tradition, cv. Perle and cv. Magnum). The results suggest that most of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo during boiling are identical for the different varieties, and thus point to the importance of the intrinsic hop oil composition for development of ‘kettle hop’ aroma during the brewing process. Moreover, selinenols and related compounds (i. e. cadinols, muurolols, eudesmols) could not be detected upon boiling of a selinene-rich sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction cv. Super Pride, supporting the hypothesis that these compounds are biosynthesised by the hop plant. Finally, scientific insights obtained on lab scale were verified in real brewing practice by brewing eight different pilot-scale lager beers, aromatised with Saaz <b>hop</b> <b>pellets</b> or <b>hop</b> oil (-derived fractions). Analysis of wort samples of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer indicated de novo formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products during the wort boiling process. This aroma profile of this beer was predominated by ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions. Combination of ‘early’ and ‘late’ kettle hopping resulted in a highly appreciated beer with intense ‘kettle hop’ flavour. A delicate balance between both ‘spicy/herbal’ and ‘floral/citrusy’ connotations appeared to be required in order to obtain the full complex spectrum of ‘kettle hop’ flavour. Aromatisation by post-fermentation addition of the sesquiterpene oxidation product fraction resulted in a beer that approached the flavour of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), the previously proposed candidate key impact compounds could be identified in both the fraction and the resulting beer. Moreover, addition of this oxidation product fraction positively influenced the bitterness perception and significantly increased mouthfeel aspects. Post-fermentation aromatisation with boiled hop oil resulted in a beer that received a high score for ‘kettle hop’ aroma and, moreover, the flavour profile of this beer was highly comparable to a conventionally kettle hopped Pilsner-type lager beer. It was concluded that these two new aromatisation technologies impart interesting flavour characteristics to beer and are promising techniques to mimic ‘kettle hop’ flavour by post-fermentation aromatisation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 22, 2016 - March 22, 2017 Hop aroma in beer {{is related to the}} unique compositional chemistry of the hops used in the brewing process. While the range of these compositions is quite diverse and primarily dependent on hop cultivar¹, other studies have also shown that cultivation, seasonality, harvesting², processing³⁴, and storage practices⁵⁶ contribute to differences in hop composition. However, {{it should be noted that}} the aroma and composition of fresh and processed hops⁷ is different than the subsequent finished beer. This irreconcilable difference that exists between hops and the finished product has been a confounding variable for brewing scientists, in large part due to the complexity and diversity of the compounds that are transferred from hops to beer, but also due to an incomplete understanding of the interactions between these compounds and the aromas they elicit. Of the many compounds found in hops, those belonging to the class known as monoterpene alcohols have consistently been useful indicators of changes in hop aroma due to different brewing practices. Notable differences exist between American and European hops in terms of the types of flavor they contribute to beer. Brewers tend to describe the former as contributing citrusy, fruity and in some instances floral aromas to beer, while the latter are often described as contributing herbal, tobacco, woody, and spicy notes. Single-hop brewing trials were carried out using either American hops (Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Citra, or Simcoe) or European hops (East Kent Goldings, Hallertau Mittlefrueh HHA or Saaz) to identify hop-derived volatiles that contribute to American hop aroma in beer. The eight resultant beers were evaluated using both sensory and instrumental analyses. The sensory analysis identified Centennial as having the highest piney and green hop aromas, while Citra and Simcoe were characterized as being very fruity, citrusy, and tropical (especially Citra). The Hallertau Mittlefrueh (HHA) beers were similar to the East Kent Goldings, and these two were more floral and rose-like than the Saaz sample with more melon character than the American cultivars. Volatile analysis of the beer samples was performed using a stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of the beer samples followed by quantification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In general, the beers brewed with the American hop varieties were higher in aroma and in monoterpene alcohols. In addition to hop oil-derived aroma, previous studies have demonstrated that non-volatile hop-derived precursors, specifically glycosides, survive the boil process and can be hydrolyzed to release volatile aglycones capable of contributing to aroma. To investigate this, twelve single hopped pilot scale beers were brewed using pellet, supercritical extract, and spent hop fractions of Citra, Simcoe, Centennial, or Cascade cultivars in order to investigate the contribution of these different hop fractions to the aroma of kettle hopped beers. The spent hop treatments produced beers that had noticeable, albeit low, hop aroma which suggest that the water-soluble components left behind in the spent hops may contribute to hop aroma. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma in the Spent treatments was hop variety. However, contributions of water soluble components from spent hops to hop aroma in beer was very subtle, especially compared to the pellet and extract treatments. Aqueous extracts of the spent material from pilot scale supercritical CO₂ fluid extraction (SFE) of <b>hop</b> <b>pellets</b> were treated to investigate the impact of different hydrolysis treatments and on the aroma and volatile profile. Aroma profiles were evaluated using descriptive analysis by a trained panel. Volatiles arising from hydrolysis treatments of aqueous extracts of the spent materials were measured using SBSE and GC-MS. The intensity and nature of the hop aroma was treatment specific. Acidic hydrolysis of water soluble extracts produced the most intense Overall and Pine aroma. Differences in the aroma intensities due to the hydrolysis from the addition of different enzyme preparations were present but subtle. Aromas liberated by ale yeast produced different profiles than the lager yeast. All treatments showed increases in aglycone content and changes in aroma profile when treated with hydrolytic enzymes preparations. However, fundamental studies that examine the extraction of glycosides during brewing and their subsequent hydrolysis by yeast have not been fully investigated. Furthermore, extraction of other hop-derived compounds into beer show a strong dependency on the hop cultivar being used and the point at which it is added. Therefore, the extent of glycoside extraction due to hopping regime, cultivar, and their hydrolysis due to yeast β-glucosidase activity was investigated. The glycoside concentration of worts made with three different hopping regimes and three cultivars was measured. Additionally, β-glucosidase activities for 80 different yeast strains and their effect on aglycone concentration in wort was determined. Glycoside content was measured by the difference in volatile aglycone concentrations between samples treated with purified β-glucosidase and untreated samples. Aglycone concentration was measured by SPME GC-MS. Results showed that yeast have a wide range of abilities to hydrolyze glycosides with a maximum hydrolysis occurring after three days of fermentation regardless of yeast activity. Although it was shown that yeast are capable of glycoside hydrolysis, glycoside concentrations in wort are low and have small contributions to hop aroma. These results help explain the extent to which different brewing yeasts and hopping regimes contribute to hoppy beer aroma through the hydrolysis of non-volatile hop-derived compounds. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of hopping regime on the monoterpene alcohol content and sensory attributes of beer, 6 single hop beers were made using different hop additions and evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis. Beers were brewed while varying two factors: hop cultivar (Simcoe and HHA) and timing of hop addition (60 min. boil, 25 min. whirlpool, or 48 -hour dryhopping). Additionally, the impact of yeast strain on treatment was investigated. Each treatment was compared to an unhopped control using SBSE GC-MS and descriptive sensory analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis were used to described the between relationships between instrumental and sensory results. Whirlpool additions produced beers with the highest concentrations of geraniol, linalool, and β-citronellol; beers brewed with highly aromatic Simcoe hops produced more intense and individually distinct aromas for each hopping regime compared to the HHA hopped beers. Conversely, beers brewed with HHA hops showed less intense aromas with less distinction between hopping regimes, except for the dry-hopped treatment, which was characterized by a more floral type aroma than the other HHA. This research shows that despite the popularity of dry-hopping as an aroma hopping method, whirlpool additions can also produce intensely aromatic beers...|$|R

Several typ es of secondary metabolites present in hops are at the origin of highly characteristic beer flavour attributes, i. e. beer bitterness and ho ppy aroma. Hop-derived beer bitterness is well defined from a chemi cal point of view and, in current brewing practice, beer bitterness can be adequately dosed and controlled because (advanced) hop products with known composition are available, and optimised analytical methods allow reliable quantification of beer bitterness. In sharp contrast with beer bitterness, the precise nature of hoppy aroma of beer is far from comple tely understood. Although it is generally recognised that mainly volatil e constituents present in, or derived from hop essential oil are involve d, hoppy aroma {{is still one of}} the most controversial aspects of beer fl avour. Indeed, flavour-active key compounds causing this highly desirabl e aspect of beer aroma remain to be identified. This gap can be ascribed to the extreme chemical complexity and varietal dependence of hop essen tial oil itself, and to modifications and losses of hop oil constituents that take place along the brewing process. Obviously, introduction of c onsistent and pleasant hoppy aroma continues to be a serious challenge i n view of obtaining a reproducible and sufficiently stable beer flavour. Whereas conventional hopping inherently leads to flavour inconsistency, currently available hop oil products can be adequately dosed at the pos t-fermentation stage in order to attain the desired hoppy aroma or hop-d erived aroma top note in a much more controlled way. In this manner, enh anced consistency of hoppy aroma in the final beer and development of ne w beers with distinct sensory flavour attributes are feasible objectives. However, the spectrum of hop oil products currently available is rathe r limited (in particular, the varietal aspect of hoppy aroma is not full y exploited), and these products often do not give the intended flavour attributes. From an economic point of view, the above mentioned issues a re highly relevant. Beer flavour consistency is of paramount importance for the modern brewing industry (also because of globalisation of the ma rket) and a too variable hoppy aroma will undoubtedly impair brand typic ality and consumer preference. Beer flavour (in) consistency in respec t of hoppy aroma, together with the unresolved issue of the true nature of hoppy aroma of beer, form the rationale of this PhD study. In general, it aimed at (1) preparation of novel hop aromas extracted directly fro m single hop varieties via supercritical fluid extraction, (2) developme nt and implementation of analytical methodologies for determination of t he volatile composition of the hop aromas and reliable measurement of th e yield of aromatisation of beer with the respective hop essences, (3) d etermination of odour impact compounds of hop oil preparations, and (4) investigation of the impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character o f pilot beers. First, an extensive literature study is presented (Par t I). An introduction to hops in beer preparation, as well as a comprehe nsive literature review on hop aroma as such and hoppy aroma of beer (th e main topic of this PhD), is provided. The experimental work c omprises 3 different parts (Part II, Part III, and Part IV, respectively), that are all further subdivided into two chapters. In Part II Pro duction of novel varietal hop aromas by supercritical fluid extraction o f hop pellets the unique properties of supercritical carbon dioxide ext raction were evaluated for preparation of different types of varietal ho p aromas from <b>hop</b> <b>pellets.</b> In chapter 1, extraction conditions were opti mised for preparation of single variety total hop essential oils that we re subsequently fractionated by solid phase extraction (SPE), yielding h op oil fractions highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated constituen ts (polar hop essences). Next, in chapter 2, a new methodology based on density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and subsequent S PE fractionation of SFE extracts was developed for preparing floral, cit rus, and spicy hop essences. Sensory properties of all novel hop aromas as such, as well as their impact on beer flavour by aromatising referenc e pilot lagers, exclusively bittered with pre-isomerised hop extract, we re clearly demonstrated and described in both chapters of this study. &nb sp;In Part III Comprehensive chemical-analytical and sensory charac terisation of varietal hop oil preparations, analytical methods based o n headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and GC-MS were optimis ed and implemented to investigate the volatile composition of varietal f loral and spicy hop essences and total hop essential oils (chapter 3). D etailed analytical characterisation of the typical volatile composition of the different types of (fractionated) hop oils, as well as discrimina tion between varietal hop aromas via principal component analysis, were clearly established. In chapter 4, the focus was on determining odour im pact compounds in floral and spicy hop essences (cv. Spalter Select). By application of advanced gas chromatography in combination with olfactom etric assessment, potent contributors to the odour of floral hop essence were identified and several odour-active regions of hitherto unidentifi ed sesquiterpenoid nature were detected in the aromagram of spicy hop es sence. In Part IV Methodology for determination of hop aromati sation of beer and evaluation of the novel hop oil preparations in brewi ng practice, selective determination of hop oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilot lagers was carried out using HS-SPME in co mbination with gas chromatography and advanced mass spectrometry such as tandem MS and selected ion monitoring (chapter 5). This approach allows monitoring the application of hop oil preparations in beer production and, as a result of this, improved control and specification of hop aroma tisation. Next, in chapter 6, the use of the hop oil preparations was in vestigated in brewing practice. In a comparative study, the impact of th e different types of hop aromas on the hoppy character of pilot lagers, as well as on beer flavour stability, was evaluated through both analyti cal and sensory protocols and compared with hoppy character and flavour stability of conventionally hopped pilot lagers. It was found that the c ontent of analytical markers for hoppy aroma (e. g. linalool and oxy genated sesquiterpenoids) as well as the intensity and the qualitative d escription of hoppy aroma, were dependent on the applied hopping technol ogy and on the hop oil fraction used for beer aromatisation. Interesting ly, sensory evaluation of beer ageing demonstrated that hop aromatisatio n, whether performed in the advanced or the conventional way, significan tly masked beer staling. As a result of our work, an innovative hop aroma technology has bee n developed, allowing the preparation of single variety hop essential oi ls and several refined hop oil fractions with pleasant and distinct sens ory attributes. The impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character of pilot lagers was clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, specific analytical and sensory tools were optimised and implemented for detailed character isation of the volatile composition of the novel hop aromas, determinati on of key odour impact compounds in hop essences, and determination of t he yield of aromatisation with the hop oil preparations in brewing pract ice. nrpages: 280 status: publishe...|$|R
