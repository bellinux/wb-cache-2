In addition, the magnitude and effects of key economic determinants of cocoa exports, production and farm gate price for Ghana are estimated. RCA and RSCA figures computed {{in the current study}} show that Ghana has comparative advantage in export of both raw and processed cocoa, with its advantage being higher in exports of the raw product. Ghana’s performance in <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> has improved significantly since 1983. This observation is attributed to initiation of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983 (which created the right conditions for agricultural investment and helped address inefficiencies in marketing and fiscal disciplines), the Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP) between 1987 and 1990 (which helped in strengthening the capacity of agricultural research, extension and policy planning), opening up of the domestic market to competition through partial liberalization of internal marketing from the early 1990 s, establishment of a price stabilization system and continuous government support to the sector through increased public spending on infrastructure and productivity-enhancing innovations. Improvement in the export performance, anticipated increases in global demand and world price of cocoa, wide yield gap of Ghana, positive attitude of farmers towards supply of cocoa due to increased government support, and intensification of competition on the domestic market indicate potential for further improvement in Ghana’s production and <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa.</b> However, upon estimates obtained in the current study, to realize any further improvement in the performance of the cocoa subsector, measures should be put in place to bridge the wide yield gap, ensure continuous government support to various stakeholders in the supply chain, and tighten the loose border between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to help minimize smuggling in times of increasing farm gate price of cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire...|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia, {{there are}} a lot of {{activity}} involving export and import of many types of commodity. One of these commodities is cocoa. Cocoa plantation has successfully conquered all countries and continents of the world in just over 500 years since it's first discovered. But in South East Asia the Spanish first introduced cocoa in the 17 th century. And in Malaysia, the cocoa was first planted in Malacca in 1778. And the earliest cocoa commercialization started between 1853 to 1959. But nowadays, cocoa was not being given much attention as other main commodities. Focus is more given to core commodities such as oil. Thus, it is important for us to look at the performance of cocoa industry in Malaysia in order to ensure that this industry may survive. Because of that, three factors will be studied in this research to look at Malaysia cocoa industry performance. The framework for this research integrates three categories of factors influencing on cocoa industry in Malaysia, which are, <b>Export</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cocoa,</b> Import of Cocoa and World Cocoa Production by other competitors. The model was tested by viewing 25 years of export, import and world production (n= 25). There are some problems occurred with the trend of cocoa industry in Malaysia. The Malaysia cocoa industry is experiencing a downward trend. This is due to some reasons. Although the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> is increasing, the trend for cocoa import is also increasing. The trend for import of cocoa in Malaysia has increase since there is an increase in the demand for cocoa by Malaysia planters. This happen because of lack of cocoa plantation areas that cause to lower cocoa supply. Thus, Malaysia cocoa planters need to get cocoa supply from other cocoa producing countries in order to produce more cocoa-based products. This had cause to an increasing trend in cocoa import. Besides, the trend for cocoa export is also increasing since there is an increase in the demand for other cocoa-based products. Malaysia has increase in the export of cocoa-based products but we still need to import cocoa from other countries since there is lack of cocoa supply in Malaysia. There is a counter-trading occur here. The research objectives are to identify the trend for export and import of cocoa in Malaysia and also to identify whether there is relationship between world cocoa production and the performance of cocoa industry in Malaysia. The research methodology used in this research is analyzing a secondary data. To identify the trend, all the data will be analyzed using graph build from Excel application. On the hand, the relationship will be analyzed using correlation and regression in SPSS. The findings in the research shows that the trend for cocoa export in Malaysia is increasing and this is the same for the trend for cocoa import in Malaysia. On the other hand the trend for Malaysia cocoa industry Is decreasing since there is an increase in both export and import of cocoa when counter-trading occurred. Meanwhile, findings also showed that there is a low relationship between world cocoa production and cocoa industry in Malaysia where world cocoa production did not give much affect t cocoa industry in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that if several {{developing}} countries expand exports, they are likely to experience a decline in their terms of trade, export revenues, and real incomes. The general case for this export pessimism has lost much of its force, but remains very much alive for some specific countries and commodities - particularly the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa,</b> coffee, and tea, which exhibit low price elasticity. The authors of this paper systematically analyze this issue for cocoa, a commodity for which many African countries have a large share in world exports. Their concern is chiefly with the problems that arise from low price elasticity of demand in the world market and their implications for trade policy. They find that increasing productivity in one African country through new investments would benefit that country - but the other African countries would lose. On the whole, the African countries would gain, however, so the gains to the country with expanded output would dominate the losses for the other countries. The return on the new investments for Africa as a whole would be positive - although significantly lower than returns for the country in which the new investments were made. This paper examines how real incomes and tax and export revenues compare under existing taxes. It analyzes the impact of export expansion on real income, export and tax revenues, and compares the effects of export expansion by African countries with that by non-African countries.

But production could not be maintained because of the erratic supply of raw material and transport problems, and raw jute had to be imported in large quantities to supply the factories.

Currently about 500 hectares of kenaf are being cultivated annually with a yield of approximately it/ha of fibre. However, commercial production of kenaf has not been started on a significant scale because of shortage of kenaf seeds. Processing has also been recognized as a key area for investment. At the primary level Kenaf processing is very laborious and a survey by KEAN has shown that the decorticators installed in the early years of the industry cannot be economically rehabilitated; they will need replacing.

40|$|Law and State, {{especially}} {{forms of}} landed property and contract, have {{played an important}} mediatory role in the internationalisation of agricultural capital in Ghana. The establishment of cocoa production in Ghana {{in the late nineteenth}} and the early part of the twentieth century established the predominance of small holder peasant production in Ghanaian agriculture. The production and <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> also established a specific form of internationalisation of agricultural capital in Ghana. This involved the subsumption of peasant commodity producers within the circuit of international capital. Because capital did not directly control production its relations with the peasantry centred around struggles over both the conditions of labour. in the sphere of production and over the realisation of the value of the peasants' product, in the sphere of circulation. These struggles were moulded by legal forms of landed property controlled by the direct producer and the character of the contractual relationship between peasant and the representatives of capital. The transformation induced by cocoa production included changes in forms of landed property, a process in which the colonial state played an important role. These changes have been a significant influence on the subsequent forms of internationalisation of agricultural capital in the post colonial period. The thesis shows through an analysis of the post colonial sugar and oil palm industries the nature of this influence. It also shows ho«- the shift in the proclaimed objectives of the state from the colonial concern with export agriculture to the "nationalist" post colonial goal of seif reliance came to be co-opted by new forms of international capital and the mediatory role of legal forms, especially contract, in this process of co-optation.

Ruling elites across the two party governments between 1993 and 2008 did not actively pursue initiatives to support the industry. Without sustained political support, the types of public-private coordination of actions and investments needed to help the sector expand and upgrade were not forthcoming in an effective and timely manner. This private sector-driven non-traditional export sector constitutes a neglected opportunity for export diversification and building a new agro-industry, and also highlights some of the factors explaining why the country's economy was still dependent on the traditional <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> and gold by {{the close of the}} 2000 s. The political challenges to changing the productive structure in Ghana {{can be found in the}} characteristics of ruling coalitions - vulnerability of the ruling elite in power, the high fragmentation within ruling coalitions, and their existing sources of and strategies for financing the state and the ruling coalition, combined with the country's existing economic structure as well as the size and capabilities of domestic capitalists. The characteristics of ruling coalitions in Ghana shaped the incentives facing ruling elites such that the ruling elites were not sufficiently compelled to support new productive sectors, such as horticulture export, which did not (yet) provide substantial revenues...|$|R

40|$|Cocoa is an {{agricultural}} good produced mostly in West Africa. The <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> is paramount for {{the economies of}} Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are the two biggest producers. The cocoa supply chain, faces {{a lot of issues}} especially in producing countries at the farm level. Poverty, poor working conditions, and the use of child labour are just a few examples of the issues related to cocoa production. Furthermore, the hard working conditions and the low financial rewards lead to younger generations seeking other sources of income. This cocoa exodus leads to an increase in the mean age of cocoa farmers which jeopardises future cocoa supply. The problem is further exacerbated by increasing demands for cocoa on the world market. These issues have led to a call for improvements in the social, economic, and environmental aspects of cocoa farming in order to avert serious supply shortages of cocoa in the near future. The dominant actors in sustainable production have traditionally been national governments or supra-national organisations. The increasing consumer demand for sustainable cocoa, along with the apparent failure of national governments in addressing the issues in cocoa production, have led to the rise of private certification standards. Private certification standards, a form of private governance, are usually the result of cooperation between civil society and market actors. The benefit of private governance is usually a marketing advantage for market actors (through a visible certificate on the products) and a means for civil society actors to pressure market actors into Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Cocoa is one of the supply chains that has undergone certification in recent decades. The benefits of becoming certified for a farmer relate to increasing yields, increasing profitability of cocoa farming, and improvements in farmer livelihoods. The rise of private standards has led to two forms of regulation of the cocoa sectors in producing countries: public governance and private governance. The goal of this research is to verify what the influence of local public governance modes is on the uptake and impact of certification. The initial research plan entailed a comparative case study design where Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire would be compared. The cocoa sector in Ghana is heavily regulated by a government institute called COCOBOD. The cocoa sector in Côte d’Ivoire, however, has little regulation providing a useful contrasting case. Safety issues in Côte d’Ivoire have made this initial research plan impossible, leading to an intensive case study of the Ghana cocoa sector instead. Mixed method analysis with both quantitative and qualitative data has been used during the research. The two data sources were further supplemented with desk research in order to triangulate the results. The qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with major stakeholders in the Ghanaian cocoa sector. The data, along with desk research, provided insights on the functioning of COCOBOD and identified the policies that affect cocoa farmers and cocoa certification. The functioning of these policies were then verified through quantitative data collected from certified cocoa farmers. Descriptive and statistical analyses were used to verify the impact of COCOBOD policies and the uptake and impact of certification at the farm level. The results of the analyses show which COCOBOD policies have an influence on the uptake and impact of certification, and whether this influence is likely to be positive or negative. Not all policy outcomes extracted from the qualitative data have been double checked with quantitative data 3 resulting in some uncertainty regarding their impact at the farm level. The policy impacts that have been verified show mixed results as to whether public policies are beneficial for certification or not. What has been concluded is that the policy regarding the distribution of inputs by Hi-Tech and CODAPEC is inefficient in its current state. Furthermore, the price fixing policy in relation to the input distribution leads to inequities as all farmers pay indirectly for the inputs, but not all farmers receive them or receive them to the same extent. However, extension services of the Cocoa Health and Extension Division of COCOBOD appear to be beneficial both for the uptake and impact of certification standards. The final conclusion of the research is that public and private governance mechanisms in the Ghanaian cocoa sector have the same goals and apply roughly the same methods. Heavy regulation in the form of public governance from COCOBOD is therefore likely to be positive for the uptake and impact of certification standards. However, COCOBOD lacks the capacity to effectively address the current issues in the Ghanaian cocoa sector. Therefore, increased cooperation to harmonise the efforts of the NGOs, cooperatives, Licensed Buying Companies, COCOBOD, and private certification standards is needed to effectively address the current issues related to cocoa production. Public Private Partnerships through the Ghana Cocoa Platform are likely to improve sustainable cocoa production in Ghana and secure a sustainable cocoa supply in the future...|$|E

It specifically estimated the determinants <b>of</b> their <b>export</b> performance and determined the degree <b>of</b> <b>export</b> diversification <b>of</b> the agricultural sector. Both export crops were chosen because they remained the most exported agricultural commodities after the number <b>of</b> agricultural <b>exports</b> commodities shrank {{from the traditional}} 12 – 15 commodities of the 1960 s. Published national aggregates on specific trade and macroeconomic variables from reputable secondary sources were used. In the course of data analysis, descriptive statistics, diversification index and Error Correction Model (ECM) were employed. Prior to estimation, Unit root and Cointegration tests were conducted. The results revealed that <b>export</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> {{was found to be}} influenced by export cost and rainfall in the long run while output, cost <b>of</b> production and <b>export</b> affected it in the short run. Rubber export supply was influenced by cost <b>of</b> <b>export</b> and exchange rate in the long run while world export-output ratio and cost <b>of</b> <b>export</b> affected it in the short run. The study results further revealed that export diversification measure showed that the sector experienced fluctuations with varying Hirschman indices which ranged from 1. 3 x 10 - 7 to 5. 1 x 10 - 7, depicting decreasing concentration.

40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this tariff escalation, it maintains, citing the cases <b>of</b> rice and <b>cocoa,</b> is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits semi-milled and milled rice imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % <b>of</b> EU rice <b>exports</b> are <b>of</b> semi-milled or milled rice, and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit <b>of</b> <b>export</b> refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular tariff peak on chocolate, arising partly from tariff escalation and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no tariff escalation, but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> paste and cocoa fat, butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending tariff escalation for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels. Such a market development would greatly undermine the value of the removal of tariff escalation. Although the EU imports {{raw materials}} from developing countries with zero or [...] ...|$|R
