The Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport computer code MCNP 5 was employed in order to predict gamma radiation levels during pool drainage. The code enabled simulation of the pool and activated components within the pool i. e. experimental tubes with in pile collimators, beryllium blocks, reactivity control rods, lead shields and <b>irradiation</b> <b>rigs.</b> The MCNP predicted gamma dose rate results were calibrated against experimental measurements performed using a submersible GM detector.

Computational and experimental studies have also been conducted for the temperature distribution in the IR with a fuel heater following the withdrawal of the IR from the reactor and its placement in a dry cooling channel.

40|$|The {{selection}} of first wall and structural materials is strongly {{dependent on the}} proposed design of breeding blanket components and the targets for a fusion reactor development. An envelope of parameters which have to be covered in future R and D activities and which have been adapted in different proposals has been compiled. A short description of interesting material groups like ferritic-martensitic steels, vanadium alloys and ceramic composites, major criteria for their selection and a survey on existing irradiation data is given. This is followed by a comparative assessment of relevant properties and an identification of major issues for each material group. A more detailed proposal for the future R and D activities is then developed for the ferritic-martensitic steels, the present reference material for the European Breeding Blankets. It describes different phases of development necessary for the qualification of this material for DEMO and gives time schedules which are compatible with parallel component developments. A more selective strategy is proposed for the development of vanadium alloys and the ceramic composite material SiC/SiC. For these alternatives work should be concentrated on identified high-risk issues, before a comprehensive development programme is started. The necessity of efficient irradiation facilities to study the irradiation behaviour of the materials under simulation - and realistic fusion conditions is discussed. The availability of high flux fission reactors and necessary extensions of <b>irradiation</b> <b>rigs</b> for the next decade is stressed. Finally it is shown that for the qualification of materials under realistic fusion conditions a high-energetic, high-flux neutron source is mandatory. An accelerator-driven d-Li neutron source (IFMIF) can fulfil essential users requirements as test bed for materials and can technically be made available in due time. In combination with ITER and DEMO, where a concept verification and full scale reliability tests of breeding blanket components can be performed appropriate and efficient tools would be available to develop materials and components towards a fusion reactor.

Despite their sheathed form, thermocouples subjected to nuclear radiations undergo changes due to radiation damage and transmutation that lead to significant EMF drift during long-term fuel irradiation experiment. For the purpose of a High Temperature Reactor fuel irradiation to take place in the High Flux Reactor Petten, a dedicated fixed-point cell was jointly developed by LNE-Cnam and JRC-IET. The developed cell to be housed in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>rig</b> was tailor made to quantify the thermocouple drift during the irradiation (about two year duration) and withstand high temperature (in the range 950 °C- 1100 °C) in the presence of contaminated helium in a graphite environment.

40|$|Since {{several years}} irradiations of HTR-spherical fuel {{elements}} {{have been done}} in a reflector position 6 V at the JUlich research reactor FRJ- 2 (DIDO), in the course of which the target burn up of the nuclear fuel has a fixed value. For the prediction of the shut down moment it is necessary to know the momentary fuel burn up state of the irradiation experiment at any time. On account of the construction of the <b>irradiation</b> <b>rig</b> the fuel burn up determination can only be performed by calculation. Only after that, this means following the irradiation end, the reached fuel burn up of the HTR-spherical fuel element can likewise be measured by gamma spectrometryor by mass spectrometry.

Under the given circumstances especially the self shielding correction for the HTR-spherical fuel element is accentuated which in the case of low enriched fuel is inevitable because of the now important resonance absorption of the neutrons in the nuclear fuel U 238. It appears, that under optimal circumstances our fuel burn up calculation is feasible with an average relative single standard deviation of approximately 7 percent.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009 Irradiation {{experiments}} for the {{pebble bed}} modular reactor PBMR fuel (coated fuel particles and pebble fuel) are planned at the South African First Atomic Reactor Installation (SAFARI- 1). The experiments are conducted {{to investigate the}} behavior of the fuel under normal operating and accelerated/accident simulating conditions because the safe operation of the reactor relies on the integrity of the fuel for retention of radioactivity. For fuel irradiation experiments, the accurate knowledge and analysis of the neutron spectrum of the irradiation facility is required. In addition to knowledge of the neutron spectrum in the irradiation facility, power distributions and knowledge of nuclear heating values has to be acquired. The SAFARI- 1 reactor boosts operating fluid temperatures of about 300 K. On the contrary, the PBMR can reach temperatures in up to about 1370 K under normal operating conditions. This calls for design of high temperature irradiation rigs for irradiation of the PBMR fuel in the SAFARI- 1 reactor. The design of this instrument (rig) should be such that to create an isolated high temperature environment in the SAFARI- 1 reactor, to achieve the requirements of the PBMR fuel irradiation program. The design of the <b>irradiation</b> <b>rig</b> is planned such that the rig should fit in the existing irradiation channels of the SAFARI- 1 reactor, a time and cost saving from the licensing perspective. This study aims to establish the know-how of coated particle and pebble modeling in using the Monte Carlo N-Particle code (MCNP 5). The study also aims to establish the know-how of rig design. In this study, the Necsa in-house code Overall System for the Calculation of Reactors (OSCAR- 3), a software known as OScar 3 -Mcnp INTerface (OSMINT) linking OSCAR- 3 and MCNP 5, also developed at Necsa, as well as MCNP 5 code developed and maintained by the Los Alamos team, are used to calculate neutronic and power distribution parameters that are important for fuel irradiations and for rig design. This study presents results and data {{that can be used to}} make improvements in the design of the rig or to confirm if the required operational conditions can be met with the current preliminary rig design. Result of the neutronic analysis are presented for the SAFARI- 1 core, core irradiation channel B 6 (where the PBMR fuel <b>irradiation</b> <b>rig</b> is loaded for the purpose of this study), the rig structure and the pebble fuel are presented. Furthermore results of the power distribution and nuclear heating values in the reactor core, the irradiation channel B 6, the rig structures and the pebble fuel is also presented. The loading of the PBMR fuel <b>irradiation</b> <b>rig</b> in core position B 6 reduces the core reactivity due to the fact that the loading of the rig displaces the water moderator in channel B 6 introducing vast amounts of helium. This impacts on the keff value because there will be less neutron thermalization and reproduction due to the decreased population of thermal neutrons. The rig is found to introduce a negative reactivity insertion of 46 pcm. The loading of this rig in the core leads to no significant perturbations on the core power distribution. The core hottest channel is still localized in core channel C 6 both with RIG IN and RIG OUT cases. A power tilt is observed, with the south side of the core experiencing reduced assembly averaged fission power, with correspondingly small compensations from the assemblies on the north side of the core. The perturbations on the core assembly averaged fluxes are more pronounced in the eight assemblies surrounding B 6. Core position B 6 suffers an 18 % neutron flux depression with the loading of the rig. The fluxes in core positions A 5, A 6, A 7, B 5, B 7 and C 7 are increased when the rig is loading. The largest increases are noted as 12 % in A 7, 9 % in A 6 and 6 % in A 5 and B 7. All the eight core positions surrounding B 6 experience reduced photon fluxes with the loading of the rig. Core position B 6 shows a flux depression of up to 20 %, with 10 % reduction in core position A 6. The remainder seven positions surrounding B 6 shows flux depressions of no more than 5 %. Further on, due to decreased moderation effects, the axial neutron flux in core position B 6 is reduced by 20 % when the rig is loaded. The energy dependent neutron flux in B 6 decreases by 50 % in the thermal energy range with corresponding increases of up to 50 % in the resonance and fast energy regions. The axial and the energy dependent photon flux in core position B 6 decreases by up to 20 % when the rig is loaded. The magnitude of the neutron and photon fluxes is found to have a direct proportion on the neutron and photon heating values. While the amount of neutron heating in core position B 6 increases by one order of magnitude, when the rig is loaded, the photon heating values increases by up to 60 % in the region spanning ± 10 cm about the core centerline. The amount of photon heating in the rig structural materials dominates neutron heating, except in the helium regions of the rig, where neutron heating dominates photon heating. In the fuel region of the pebble, fission heating (3803 W) largely dominates photon heating (119 W). Master...|$|E
