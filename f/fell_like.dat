5|$|On {{the morning}} of the match, Larwood was unfit and Allen played. England batted first, and Allen scored three runs before being {{dismissed}} on the first afternoon. On the second morning, an article in the Daily Express by Trevor Wignall, a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories, suggested that the crowd's enjoyment of the day was marred by Allen's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth. Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted, and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace. That day, Allen opened the bowling for England; after a slow start, the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket <b>fell.</b> <b>Like</b> the other bowlers, Allen then rapidly conceded runs to Donald Bradman, who scored 254 runs. Australia scored 729 for six declared in reply to England's 425, and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 overs. England lost early wickets in their second innings, and when Allen came in to bat, the score was 147 for five wickets, still 167 behind the Australians. He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain, Percy Chapman, to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets. In contrast to the reaction to his bowling, Allen's innings was praised in the press. This was his only Test of the series.|$|E
25|$|The fell’s {{unusual and}} pleasant-sounding name, {{previously}} only {{applied to the}} summit rocks, has now been accepted as the name for the whole <b>fell.</b> <b>Like</b> many fells of the district the name comes {{from a series of}} Old Norse words which in this case is translated as “Hill with the mountain hut by a chasm”.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, Glasgow was {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} the second city; and during much of the 20th century it had a population of over one million, larger than that of Birmingham until the 1951 census. For example, the Official Census population for Glasgow was 0.784 million in April 1911; 1.034 million in April 1921; 1.088 million in April 1931 and 1.090 million in April 1951. However, slum clearances in the 1960s led to displacement of residents from the city centre to new communities located outside the city boundaries. This, together with local government reorganisation, resulted in the official population of Glasgow falling sharply. The Glasgow City Council area currently has a population of 600,000 although the surrounding conurbation of Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,199,629. In contrast, the population of the city of Birmingham has remained steady around the one million mark; its central population <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> Glasgow's, but the city boundaries were extended several times in the early 20th century. Occasional claims were made for Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E

The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E

Western press followed suit; Time magazine, although incorrectly reporting that [...] "there was not enough left of the crushed gondola or the three broken bodies to supply {{the story of the}} tragedy", correctly guessed the roots of the catastrophe: [...] "winter weather had contracted the balloon's gas to such a point that it <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> a dead weight".|$|E

2500|$|The obvious line is from Loweswater village, {{ascending}} Mosedale. An early {{crossing of}} the river (wide, no bridge) allows Little Dodd to be climbed. Further travel through the swamps of Mosedale or Whiteoak Moss can lead more directly to the summit, but rarely dryshod. Not for nothing does Wainwright remark on Hen Comb as [...] "rising...between side valleys that carry streams down from a wide upland morass, a desolate tract of marshland and bog encircling the extremity of the <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> a moat, out of which rise the summit slopes as an island from the sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jin troops withdrew with a ransom of Song {{silk and}} treasure, but {{returned}} several months later, {{this time with}} their own gunpowder bombs manufactured by captured Song artisans. According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the [...] "earliest truly detailed descriptions {{of the use of}} gunpowder weapons in warfare." [...] Records show that Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and trebuchets to hurl gunpowder bombs while Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the [...] "molten metal bomb" [...] (金汁炮). As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their [...] "fire bombs <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> rain, and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable." [...] Jin captured Kaifeng despite the appearance of the molten metal bomb and secured another 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|The volcano is {{currently}} classified as active {{with a low}} risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707 (Hōei 4, 23rd day of the 11th month), and ended about January 1, 1708 (Hōei 4, 9th day of the 12th month), during the Edo period. The eruption formed a new crater and a second peak, named Mount Hōei (after the Hōei era), halfway down its southeastern side. Fuji spewed cinders and ash which <b>fell</b> <b>like</b> rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi. Since then, {{there have been no}} signs of an eruption. In the evening of March 15, 2011, there was a magnitude 6.2 earthquake at shallow depth a few kilometres from Mount Fuji on its southern side. [...] But according to the Japanese Meteorological Service {{there was no sign of}} any eruption.|$|E
