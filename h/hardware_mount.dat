40|$|Mario Kart is {{a popular}} go-kart racing game {{developed}} by Nintendo. The premise {{of the game is}} simple: drive a go-kart along a racetrack and reach the finish line before the other players. What makes this game unique, however, is the inclusion of weapons, traps, and other projectiles that a player can use to gain an advantage in the race. We have taken on the challenge of not only recreating this amazing game, but using the art of Augmented Reality to fully immerse the player in the full experience. Rather than play the game on a television screen with a video game controller, the player can physically sit in a moving go-kart, drive along a track, and allow the virtual game to unfold on a mounted viewing screen. By overlaying HUD information and other graphics on the screen, the player can feel as though he or she is interacting with the virtual game.

50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the profile of a rail. This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based <b>hardware</b> <b>mounted</b> to the front and rear of the rail grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the rail profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an evaluation, which compares three interfaces for translating and rotating virtual objects in an Augmented Reality environment. We used a mouse/keyboard based interface, an infrared-tracking based gesture recognition system, and our tangible user interface, which we developed for this evaluation. Our tangible user interface {{consists of two}} accelerometers, one gyroscope, and four buttons integrated in a cuboid casing. The evaluation focused on a comparison of immersion, intuitiveness, mental and physical workload, and task execution times. The test persons had to solve a given task with all interfaces (translating an object, rotating an object, and a combination of translation and rotation). The results showed that a translation of a virtual object takes nearly {{the same amount of}} time with all interfaces, but much more than a similar manipulation in a real environment. Rotation is performed as the slowest using a mouse/keyboard based interface. For a combination of translation and rotation, gesture recognition based interaction turned out to be the fastest way of interaction. All kinds of manipulation showed, that gesture recognition provides the most immersive and intuitive interaction with the lowest mental workload. But these benefits are limited by the highest rating of physical workload, caused by additional <b>hardware</b> <b>mounted</b> at the user’s hand, as well as the fact, that the user has to hold his arm upwards during the task execution.
