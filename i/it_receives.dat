5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than <b>it</b> <b>receives</b> from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation <b>it</b> <b>receives.</b> This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than <b>it</b> <b>receives</b> from the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, <b>it</b> <b>receives</b> 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E

5|$|Models predict that, if its non-Keplerian orbit {{could be}} {{averaged}} to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0.28, then tidal heating {{would play a}} significant role in the planet's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten. Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy <b>it</b> <b>receives</b> from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.|$|E
