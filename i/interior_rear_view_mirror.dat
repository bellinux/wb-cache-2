Schefenacker Lighting Systems Australia (SLSA) in Taree manufactures Tail Lamps, Turn Signals, High Mounted Stop Lamps, Interior Lighting and Small Lamps. Both {{of these}} divisions {{have their own}} laboratory where usage and environmental tests are performed on the product. The tests performed are comparable to normal usage of the product over ten years. SVSA, Lonsdale has expanded their testing in the last year. Testing of a new mirror family which is larger than earlier mirrors has resulted in investment of new test equipment and a split of the laboratory in May 2006 into two facilities. One new test laboratory area was created on Aldershot Road 500 m from the laboratory area on Sheriffs Road. To make the laboratory more effective an amalgamation of these two laboratories and the photometric laboratory in Taree is planned {{in the beginning of}} 2007. The aim for this project is to recommend one layout for a new amalgamated laboratory, planned with a view towards Lean Production. The new layout shall fit in an allotted area of 1006 m 2 in the warehouse on Aldershot Road, which belongs to SVSA, Lonsdale. The facilities that will be included in the amalgamation are the existing laboratory facility on Sheriffs Road and the additional laboratory facility already located on Aldershot Road, and the photometric facility from the test laboratory in Taree. The methods used for achieving the layout are Simplified Systematic Layout Planning, data collection, literature studies and benchmarking. Two detailed layouts were developed and evaluated. Layout 1 -room has one temperature controlled room located {{in the middle of the}} warehouse, with equipment for testing the performance. Layout 2 -open has two open areas, one for new planning of performance and durability, and one area for the durability test planned for the flow of the new mirror family already existing on Aldershot Road. The layouts include areas for reception, offices, employee rooms, goods reception and delivery, vibration room, sound room, dust room and the photometric laboratory from Taree. These two layouts were both adequate for the laboratory business and a final evaluation between theses two were necessary. The two layouts were very similar in function and the cost for investment and running becomes the knock-out factor. Layout 1 -room was most appropriate in all issues for the amalgamation and is the one recommended. Additionally a further recommendation is to install a well functional heating and cooling system and the purchase of work benches with adjustable height giving space for legs, knees and feet when standing work is performed.

50|$|The Corgi {{design team}} {{came up with}} the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled {{headlights}} and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of 'firsts' with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed <b>interior</b> with a <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the rear parcel shelf. At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the one-year}} {{anniversary of the}} {{introduction}} of the fifth generation, [...] "EyeSight" [...] was once again offered on the Touring Wagon only. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one {{on each side of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> that use human like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E

50|$|A Turbo {{version of}} the 993 was {{launched}} in 1995 {{and became the first}} standard production Porsche with twin turbochargers and the first 911 Turbo to be equipped with permanent all-wheel-drive (the homologated GT2 retained RWD). The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the Porsche 959. The 3.6 L twin turbo M64/60 engine produced 408 PS (300 kW / 402 BHP). The performance was outstanding, as 0 to 60mph has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive 60 to 0 in 2.3 seconds. The brakes were in fact able to stop 1,000 hp. The car's top speed topped out at 200mph at 7,000 rpm. This was the first turbo with all wheel drive and the capabilities to match the famed 959. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 liters of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. There were basically two years of production 1996 model year and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested center caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the <b>interior</b> <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.|$|E
