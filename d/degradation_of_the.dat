Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1 {{has three}} {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs) {{mounted on a}} boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power {{at the time of}} launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time (due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermocouples), but the craft's RTGs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E

5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E

5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Official Historian Charles Stacey and {{military}} historian Michael Reynolds, wrote that German casualty figures for individual operations {{are difficult to}} determine; Stacey attributes this to the gradual <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German logistics chain leaving incomplete records and Reynolds wrote that units sometimes over-reported their losses, {{in the hope of}} receiving more reinforcements. German losses for the battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by the Canadians. According to Reynolds, between 16 July and 1 August, the 1st SS Panzer Division lost 1,092 men killed, wounded or captured—along with 11 Panzer IV tanks and 10 Sturmgeschütz III self-propelled guns—in fighting across all its fronts including at Verrières. Over a similar period, he estimates the 12th SS Panzer Division—in all sectors—suffered only 134 casualties. Many of the German fallen are buried at La Cambe German war cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium.

Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA was tested and found to belong to mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's mitochondrial DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E

5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E
