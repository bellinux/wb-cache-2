However, the only herd that became established outside France during this period was in New Caledonia, which continued to import Limousins. It was not until after the reform of Limousin breeding in France in 1962 that significant numbers were exported around the world. Limousins were reintroduced in Argentina (1966) and Brazil (1978), and imported to other European countries such as Spain (1965), Italy (1968), the Netherlands (1969), Denmark (1970), and the United Kingdom (1971). Their introduction to the United Kingdom provided opportunities for Australia and New Zealand to import semen in 1972. Soon after, New Zealand allowed the importation of Limousins from both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the first Full French cattle were imported to Australia from New Zealand in 1975.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} century, the {{selection}} for production traits {{of the main}} livestock species {{has led to a}} reduction in number of local populations with consequent loss of genetic variability. In Sardinia, the genetic improvement strategy has been based on selection for the local pure breed in sheep, whereas in the other species (cattle, swine and goat), an often unplanned crossbreeding with improved breeds has been applied. In this context, several studies on genetic diversity of these populations have been started with the final aim of recovering the autochthonous genetic types. The global approach involves different steps: - characterization of the farming system and typical products; - morphological and productive evaluation of the animals; - genetic characterization of the populations through molecular DNA analyses (microsatellites, AFLP, mitochondrial DNA, etc.); - creation of nucleus flocks in public farms and germoplasm banks; - organization of <b>herd-books</b> involving farmers interested in the safeguard of local breeds and valorisation of traditional products.

40|$|Biotechnology {{has been}} part of human culture for a very long time. Farm animals of today ensure food and {{agriculture}} production and have mainly developed over thousands of years of domestication. They are the result of selection on the basis of phenotypic parameters by humans and adaptation to different environments and environmental challenges and represent genetically distinct species and breeds of different purposes within species. While breeding with the definition of breeds and <b>herd-books</b> started in most species about 100 years ago, the consequent use of biotechnology began about 50 years ago with the introduction of artificial insemination. Major fields of biotechnology applied to animal production are further reproductive techniques, marker assisted selection including detection of deleterious alleles, genomic selection, and conservation of genetic resources. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer are important methods used in animal breeding, especially in cattle production to multiply the population of animals at a rapid rate. Both techniques are essential to improve the genetics of animals by having a high impact on selection intensity and accuracy and are usually implemented in breeding programs all over the world. Supporting methods such as embryo splitting/sexing, semen sexing, cloning and in vitro maturation have improved the efficiency of artificial insemination and embryo transfer, while transgenic farm animals do not exist on farm level. The implementation of molecular genetic methods in animal breeding resulted in remarkable advances {{over the last two decades}} in the identification of chromosomal regions and loci affecting economically important traits in livestock production. Basis for this were the advances in the availability of whole genome sequences and the identification of genetic variation on a large scale within international research projects. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology (SNP-Chip) has, in the meantime, enabled profiling animals for thousands of marker loci in a single analysis. This amount of information in combination with phenotypic records of the breeding organizations and with reproductive technologies supports high input breeding with a dramatic increase in the level of productivity. While this technology is already successfully used in breeding programs of breeds/species where the economic environment supports high input breeding, the situation for local breeds/species with at the moment less importance is difficult as they lack at the necessary infrastructure especially in developing countries and are declining in number. On the other hand, biotechnology is an effective tool that allows the characterization and conservation of animal genetic resources at risk of loss of genetic diversity...|$|R

The degree of inbreeding in populations is necessary to monitor and on the basis of creating mating plans, so that was the greatest genetic gain achieved in the conservation of genetic variability, which will have a negative effect on fitness and utility properties. Population analysis was prepared based on data from the <b>herd-books</b> in 1985 up to 2013. The data contained the pedigree of the Bohemian Forest sheep, which is placed between the genetic resources in the Czech Republic. Using the program SAS 5. 8 (Statistical Analysis Software) the value of the coefficient of inbreeding have been established for each individual and the average value of the entire population. The other trend was the evaluation of the parameters of the vyhodnocenými coefficient of inbreeding in the reference period and the effective population size, and the generational interval for the four paths of transmission of genes and two transmission paths of genes. The trend of development of the coefficient of inbreeding (Fx) was evaluated as a kolísavě rising with an average of around 0. 6 %. The average generation interval (L) for the four paths of gene transfer was calculated for two years and 3. 83 journey 3. 55 years gene transfer. The value of the generation interval, the shorter the period considered, resulting in the intensification of genetic gain. The effective population size (Ne) was estimated in two ways.

60|$|He {{rose from}} the chair where he had sat looking up into her pictured face, and went to open the safe near the window. But he stopped in stooping over to work the combination, and glanced out across his {{shoulder}} into the night. The familiar beauty of the scene tempted him to the window for what, all at once, he felt might be his last look, though the next instant {{he was able to}} argue the feeling down, and make his meditated act work into his schemes of early retrieval and honorable return. He must have been thinking there before the fire a long time, for now the moon had risen, and shone upon the black bulk of firs to the southward, and on the group of outbuildings. These were in a sort the mechanism that transacted the life of his house, ministering to all its necessities and pleasures. Under the conservatories, with their long stretches of glass, catching the moon's rays like levels of water, was the steam furnace that imparted their summer climate, through heavy mains carried below the basement, to every chamber of the mansion; a ragged plume of vapor escaped from the tall chimney above them, and dishevelled itself in diaphanous silver on the night-breeze. Beyond the hot-houses lay the cold graperies; and off to the left rose the stables; in a cosy nook of this low mass Northwick saw the lights of the coachman's family-rooms; beyond the stables were the cow-barn and the dairy, with the farmer's cottage; it was a sort of joke with Northwick's business friends that you could buy butter of him sometimes at less than half it cost him, and the joke flattered Northwick's sense of baronial consequence with regard to his place. It was really a farm in extent, and it was mostly a grazing farm; his cattle were in the <b>herd-books,</b> and he raised horses, which he would sell now and then to a friend; they were so distinctly varied from the original stock as to form almost a breed of themselves; they numbered scores in his stalls and pastures. The whole group of the buildings was so great that it was like a sort of communal village. In the silent moonlight Northwick looked at {{it as if it were}} an expansion or extension of himself, so personally did it seem to represent his tastes, and so historical was it of the ambitions of his whole life; he realized that it would be like literally tearing himself from it, when he should leave it. That would be the real pang; his children could come to him, but not his home. But he reminded himself that he was going only for a time, until he could rehabilitate himself, and come back upon the terms he could easily make when once he was on his feet again. He thought how fortunate it was that in the meanwhile this property could not be alienated; how fortunate it was that he had originally deeded it to his wife in the days when he had the full right to do so, and she had willed it to their children by a perfect entail. The horses and the cattle might go, and probably must go; and he winced to think of it, but the land, and the house,--all but the furniture and pictures,--were the children's and could not be touched. The pictures were his, and would have to go with the horses and cattle; but ten or twelve thousand dollars would replace them, and he must add that sum to his other losses, and bear it as well as he could.|$|R
