5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilization,</b> a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilization</b> has some issues regarding its use of embryos.

5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilization</b> (IVF) {{procedures were}} carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252.

5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal.

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} using <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilization</b> may be genetically {{tested for}} HD using {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} {{cases of}} morphological gonadal alterations in fish {{have been recorded}} throughout the world and across {{a wide range of}} species. In the whitefish Coregonus fatioi from the pre-alpine Lake Thun (Switzerland), the frequency of gonadal alterations is particularly high and the variety of alteration types large. Little is known about the proximal causes and the direct consequences of these morphological features on population persistence. In particular, the potential for the observed alterations to be the phenotypic expression of reduced genetic quality has not yet been addressed. In this study, we used offspring survival during embryogenesis as a proximate indicator of male genetic quality and tested whether the presence of gonadal alterations in males is an indicator of reduced quality. Embryos resulted from <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations</b> of gametes from 126 males and females. We found no significant correlation between embryo survival and gonadal alteration in adults.

40|$|Hatching is an {{important}} niche shift, and embryos {{in a wide range}} of taxa can either accelerate or delay this life-history switch in order to avoid stage-specific risks. Such behavior can occur in response to stress itself and to chemical cues that allow anticipation of stress.

As a study species, we chose the brown trout (Salmo trutta; Salmonidae). Gametes were collected from five natural populations (within one river network) and used for full-factorial <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations.</b> The resulting embryos were either directly infected with Pseudomonas fluorescens or were exposed to waterborne cues from P. fluorescens-infected conspecifics.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, concern {{regarding}} perchlorate contamination {{has arisen}} in many contexts. Perchlorate has many military, commercial, and domestic applications, {{and it has}} been found in milk, drinking and irrigation water, and produce. Perchlorate is harmful at low levels, yet it remains unregulated in the United States while the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency attempts to establish acceptable exposure levels. The present study investigated potential reproductive effects on vertebrates using a model fish species, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Sticklebacks were raised from syngamy through sexual maturity in untreated water and in three target concentrations of sodium perchlorate–treated water. Perchlorate was found to interfere with the expression of nuptial coloration, courtship behavior, and normal sexual development. Genetic testing revealed that some females were masculinized {{to the extent that they}} produced both sperm and eggs, and histological analysis showed that these individuals had intersexual gonads (ovotestes) containing both oocytes and cells undergoing spermatogenesis. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations</b> revealed that those gametes were capable of self- and cross-fertilization. However, crosses using sperm derived from genetic females died either during the blastula phase or near the onset of organogenesis. Sperm derived from genetic males produced viable fry when crossed with eggs derived from genetic females from all treatments. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence that perchlorate produces androgenic effects and is capable of inducing functional hermaphroditism in a nonhermaphroditic vertebrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} females to adaptively {{influence}} offspring phenotype via maternal effects is widely acknowledged, but corresponding nongenetic paternal effects remain unexplored. Males can adjust sperm phenotype {{in response to}} local conditions, but the transgenerational consequences of this plasticity are unknown. We manipulated paternal density of a broadcast spawner (Styela plicata, a solitary ascidean) using methods shown previously to alter sperm phenotype in the field, then conducted <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations</b> that excluded maternal effects and estimated offspring performance under natural conditions. Offspring sired by males from low-density experimental populations developed faster and had a higher hatching success than offspring sired by males living in high densities. In the field, offspring survived relatively better when their environment matched their father 2 ̆ 7 s, raising the possibility that fathers can adaptively influence the phenotype of their offspring according to local conditions. As {{the only difference between}} offspring is whether they were artificially fertilized by sperm from males kept in high- vs. low-density cages, we can unequivocally attribute any differences in offspring performance to an environmentally induced paternal effect. Males of many species manipulate the phenotype of their sperm in response to sperm competition: our results show this plasticity can influence offspring fitness, potentially in adaptive ways, raising the possibility that adaptive nongenetic paternal effects may be more common than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{contaminants}} {{that mimic}} native estrogens (i. e., environmental estrogens) {{are known to}} significantly impact {{a wide range of}} vertebrate species and have been implicated as a source for increasing human male reproductive deficiencies and diseases. Despite the widespread occurrence of environmental estrogens and recognized detrimental effects on male vertebrate reproduction, no specific mechanism has been determined indicating how reduced fertility and/or fecundity is achieved. Previous studies show that male rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, exposed to the environmental estrogen 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) before gamete formation and fertilization produce progeny with significantly reduced embryonic survival. To determine whether this observed decrease results from sperm chromosome alterations during spermatogenesis, male rainbow trout were exposed to 10 ng of EE 2 /l for 50 days. After exposure, semen was collected and sperm aneuploidy levels analyzed with two chromosome markers by fluorescent in situ hybridization. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations</b> were also conducted by using control and exposed sperm crossed to eggs from an unexposed female for offspring analysis. Evaluations for nucleolar organizer region number and karyotype were performed on developing embryos to determine whether sperm aneuploidy translated into embryonic aneuploidy.

Additionally, embryonic cells from propagated progeny of individuals possessing elevated sperm aneuploidy display high levels of embryonic aneuploidy.

40|$|Sperm {{competition}} has classically been thought to maintain anisogamy (large eggs and smaller sperm) because males {{are thought to}} maximize their chance of winning fertilizations by trading sperm size for number. More recently it has been recognized that sperm quality (e. g., size, velocity) can also influence sperm competition, although studies have yielded conflicting results. Because sex evolved in the sea, debate has continued {{over the role of}} sperm competition and sperm environment in determining both sperm and egg size in externally fertilizing broadcast spawners. Remarkably, however, there have been no direct tests of whether broadcast spawners change the traits of their gametes depending on the likelihood of sperm competition. We manipulated the density (and thus, sperm environment) of a broadcast spawning ascidian (Styela plicata) in the field and then determined whether the phenotype of eggs and sperm changed. We found that sperm from adults kept at high density were larger and more motile than sperm from low-density adults. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilizations</b> revealed that sperm from high-density adults also lived longer and induced less polyspermy. Adult density also affected egg traits: eggs from high-density adults were smaller targets for sperm overall but produced larger ovicells than eggs from low-density adults. This suggests that broadcast spawning mothers balance (potentially conflicting) pre- and postzygotic selection pressures on egg size. Overall, our results suggest that sperm competition does not represent a strong force maintaining anisogamy in broadcast spawners. Instead, sperm limitation seems to select for large eggs and smaller, more numerous sperm...|$|R
