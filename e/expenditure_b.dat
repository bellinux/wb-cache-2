The impact of the {{variability in}} physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, and chronic health conditions (co-morbidities) on the independence of older adults, especially over time, is seldom examined. This study aims to analyze quantitatively the impact of baseline values and changes in physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, and co-morbidities on the physical independence of community-dwelling, older adults over a 5 -year period. Data from 106 and 85 community-dwelling adults (! 60 years) were collected at baseline and after five years, respectively. Linear regression selected the main predictors of changes in physical independence as follows: the baseline physical independence (b = 0. 032, R 2 = 9. 9 %) and co-morbidities (b = 0. 191, R 2 = 6. 3 %) and the changes in co-morbidities (b= 0. 244, R 2 = 10. 8 %), agility (b= 0. 288, R 2 = 6. 7 %), aerobic endurance (b = 0. 007, R 2 = 3. 2 %), and walking <b>expenditure</b> (<b>b</b> = 0. 001, R 2 = 5. 1 %) (p < 0. 05).

The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate ways in which an organisation could reduce its operational costs and therefore be greener through the implementation of either a complete solar solution or a more hybrid mix with cloud computing thrown in. Through the creation of a hypothetical UK based SME we compared solar technology currently in the market in order to understand not only the total investment required but also just how efficient solar technology is, or perhaps is not. We also investigated comparable technology from the three cloud providers (Microsoft, Amazon and Google) to discover whether replacing on-premise hardware with that available in data centres would be more cost-effective than full solar solution or reduce the total amount of solar technology required. Having conducted the research, we found that solar technology is in no way an effective solution for the total replacement of power from the national grid, it can be very pricey to implement especially on the scale of always on computing and is easily affected by the elements-which given the UK as a location is not ideal. It was also discovered that cloud computing is in no way as affordable as it is perhaps made out to be but has the benefits of being considered a) an operational <b>expenditure,</b> <b>b)</b> fully maintained and; c) fully flexible, these all being reasons which help a growing SME expand down the line without unnecessary hardware outlay.

Nine of the twelve districts consolidated by mutual agreement of the two school boards and three annexations were by order of the Commissioner of Education of Texas. Financial criteria studied were: a) per pupil <b>expenditures,</b> <b>b)</b> total state aid, c) transportation costs, d) administrative costs, e) school district "wealth" status, and f) facilities assets/liabilities. Each of the initial 24 independent school districts' criteria were collected for two years prior to consolidation and the 12 newly formed consolidated districts criteria were collected for the two years following consolidation. After consolidation, ten of the twelve districts had fewer than 1, 000 students. Of the other two districts, one district had approximately 3, 000 students and one large district had over 150, 000 students. Some districts experienced increases in local expenditures relative to transportation, administrative costs and total expenditures while other districts decreased costs over time.

40|$|Learning by doing, {{especially}} spillover learning, {{has received}} much attention lately in models of industry evolution and economic growth. The predictions {{of these models}} depend {{on the distribution of}} learning abilities and knowledge flows across firms and countries. However, the empirical literature provides little guidance on these issues. In this paper, I use plant level data on a sample of entrants in SIC 38, Instruments, to examine the characteristics associated with both proprietary and spillover learning by doing. The plant level data permit tests for the relative importance of within and between firm spillovers. I include both formal knowledge, obtained through R&D expenditures, and informal knowledge, obtained through learning by doing, in a production function framework. I allow the speed of learning to vary across plants according to characteristics such as R&D intensity, wages, and the skill mix. The results suggest that (a) Ainformal@ knowledge, accumulated through production experience at the plant, is a much more important source of productivity growth for these plants than is Aformal@ knowledge gained via research and development <b>expenditures,</b> (<b>b)</b> interfirm spillovers are stronger than intrafirm spillovers, (c) the slope of the own learning curve is positively related to worker quality, (d) the slope of the spillover learning curve is positively related to the skill mix at plants, (e) neither own nor spillover learning curve slopes are related to R&D intensities. These results imply that learning by doing may be, to some extent, an endogenous phenomenon at these plants. Thus, models of industry evolution that incorporate learning by doing may need to be revised. The results are also broadly consistent with the recent growth models.

A qualitative research methodology was used in this study. Data collection consisted of interviews with superintendents and business officials in the pilot group during January 2000. The administrators joined the pilot group because they believed all Indiana school corporations would eventually convert to a fiscal year budget and that their experiences would facilitate the conversion. They supported the concept of a fiscal year budget because it was congruous with the school-year. During implementation of the fiscal year budget, the administrators felt abandoned and did not receive the support they expected. Yet, based on their experiences with a fiscal year budget, the administrators supported a conversion to a fiscal year budget for all school corporations. Administrators recommended the state phase-in a fiscal year budget for other non-pilot school corporations. These findings suggest that administrators had valid reasons for joining the pilot group. In addition, administrators viewed the absence of key leaders at the state level as problematic for the pilot project. Based on the evidence, it appears that a fiscal year budget produced the following advantages for the participating corporation administrators: (a) allowed for better tracking of <b>expenditures,</b> (<b>b)</b> required less work to determine the cost of a school-year program, (c) allowed for more freedom in the summer, and (d) provided for a less stressful year-end.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of formal health insurance, we argue that the {{strategies}} households adopt to finance health care {{have important implications for}} the measurement and interpretation of how health payments impact on consumption and poverty. Given data on source of finance, we propose to (a) approximate the relative impact of health payments on current consumption with a 'coping'-adjusted health <b>expenditure</b> ratio, (<b>b)</b> uncover poverty that is 'hidden' because total household expenditure is inflated by financial coping strategies and (c) identify poverty that is 'transient' because necessary consumption is temporarily sacrificed to pay for health care. Measures that ignore coping strategies not only overstate the risk to current consumption and exaggerate the scale of catastrophic payments but also overlook the long-run burden of health payments. Nationally representative data from India reveal that coping strategies finance as much as three-quarters of the cost of inpatient care. Payments for inpatient care exceed 10 % of total household expenditure for around 30 % of hospitalized households but less than 4 % sacrifice more than 10 % of current consumption to accommodate this spending. Ignoring health payments leads to underestimate poverty by 7 - 8 % points among hospitalized households; 80 % of this adjustment is hidden poverty due to coping.

The current paper lays out a research strategy to explore the effects of fiscal policy, including the composition of public expenditure, on economic growth, using a time series approach.

Methods: The dynamic model calculates the budget impact from two different perspectives: (a) the impact on healthcare <b>expenditures</b> and (<b>b)</b> on <b>expenditures</b> as well as on health insurance revenues due to premiums. The latter approach could especially be useful for patients with chronic diseases who have higher probabilities of early retirement. Early retirement rates and indirect costs were derived from published data. Healthcare premiums were calculated based on an average premium and a mean income. Epidemiological input data were obtained from the literature. Time horizon was 10 years. Results: Results in terms of reimbursement decisions of the budget impact analysis varied depending on the assumptions made for the insurance premiums, costs, and early retirement rate. Sensitivity analyses revealed that in extreme cases the decision for accepting a new pharmaceutical product would probably be negative using approach (a), but positive using approach (b). Conclusions: Depending on the disease and population of interest in a budget impact analysis, not only the healthcare expenditures for a health insurance have to be considered but also the revenue side for an insurance due to retirement should be included.

With increasing fruit seediness, larval food increases and larval mortality decreases.

The British Gambling Prevalence Survey is a large-scale nationally representative survey of participation in gambling and the prevalence of problem gambling in Great Britain. The aims of the survey series are: measure the prevalence of participation in all forms of commercial and private gambling (including estimates of expenditure and information on venue) estimate the prevalence of 'problem gambling' and look at which activities have the highest prevalence of 'problem gamblers' investigate the socio-demographic factors associated with gambling and with 'problem gambling' assess attitudes towards gambling Further information about the series {{can be found on}} the Gambling Commission's British Gambling Prevalence Surveys web pages. British Gambling Prevalence Survey, 1999 is the first survey in the series. The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) was commissioned by GamCare to carry out the first-ever survey of the Lottery and other gambling activities in Britain. GamCare is a national charity that promotes responsible gambling and monitors the social impact of gambling. In 1999, after the National Lottery was created and a wide range of gambling activities were available, this study was designed to find out who gambles, and on what. Most people enjoy gambling, and do so within sensible limits. A small number, however, get into severe problems with their gambling. Therefore an important aspect of this survey was to examine rates of problem gambling among the British population and to assess which gambling activities cause problems and for whom.

Medicare provides FFS coverage {{to the majority of}} its beneficiaries and may thus provide a way of examining these so-called spillover effects. This paper examines 1986 - 1990 Medicare FFS expenditures at the county- and MSA- levels, coupled with county- and MSA-level measures of HMO market share. Fixed-effects and IV estimates of the relationship between market share and expenditures are presented. All of the models imply that FFS expenditures are concave in market share and that expenditures are decreasing in market share for market shares above about 18 %. Many of the estimates suggest that expenditures become decreasing in market share at much lower levels (between 0 % and 10 %). Fixed-effects estimates imply that increases in market share from 20 to 30 percent would be associated with expenditure reductions of 3. 4 % - 6. 6 % in Part A expenditures and 2. 5 % - 5. 6 % in Part <b>B</b> <b>expenditures.</b> IV estimates imply larger responses.

The relation between environmental policy and life satisfaction is not as pronounced. The evidence for the effect of environmental quality on both satisfaction with democracy and life satisfaction is not very clear, although we find evidence that citizens value personal mobility (in terms of having a car) highly, but view the presence of trucks as unpleasant. We also document that parents, younger citizens, and those with high levels of educational attainment tend to care more about environmental issues than do non-parents, older citizens, and those with fewer years of schooling.

In the pr 4 t study, we compared these estimates with resting energy expenditures (REE) (n 141) measured weekly by indirect calorimetry in 20 patients between postburn days 3 and 348. In this group, mean initial burn size was 46. 7 % (range, 21 - 88) and-mean age 31. 3 years (range, 19 - 61). Serial measurements were continued until the JAK 1 l 101995 burn wounds were closed or the patient was discharged. Multiple regression analysis indicated a relationship between REE, initial burn size, and postburn day.,. in these patients (r = 0. 65). This analysis indicated a general trend of decline in • 4 •. K I REE toward normal values 100 to 150 days postburn in patients with smaller burns W [...] , (20 %- 40 %) and roughly 250 days postinjury in those with larger burns (> 75 %). The initial predictive equation appeared adequate for estimating caloric needs during the first postburn month, but beyond 30 days postburn indirect calorimetric measurements became necessary for accurate estimation of caloric requirements.

40|$|General {{government}} {{activity in}} the field of education has recently assumed new interest due to the importance of two analytical objectives: a) the existence of substitution or complementary processes between public and private <b>expenditure</b> in education; <b>b)</b> the importance of public expenditure in the fields of education, health etc. in economic development. Between 1861 and 1913, statistical information regarding Italian expenditure in education at local (provincial and municipal) level is particularly scarce and there is none at all on expenditure at local level for a number of periods. The reconstruction of missing data for regressors has been carried out by NIPALS algorithm (Non-linear estimation by Iterative PArtial Least Square) which calculates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) even when there are missing data. The reconstructed data have allowed improvement of the informative set and the lines of interpretation of General Government action in education. Our data confirm the idea that policies regarding education in Italy have relied predominantly on local resources at municipal level. Furthermore, transfers from Central Government to the municipal authorities assumed great importance after 1904. Finally, it is to be noted that Central government expenditure on education in a strict sense (excluded expenses for museums, academies etc.) has been stable until 1904. Truly incisive policies regarding Central government are to be found only in successive periods. economic development, education, human capital, merit goods, principal components analysis, time series analysis. ...|$|R
