50|$|Joselito hams {{are taken}} from the hind limb of the adult pig, level with the <b>ischiopubic</b> <b>symphysis,</b> and they are {{prepared}} using appropriate salting and natural curing processes. The thin legs contain a fat that has a soft, oily consistency and pinkish tones. The meat is marbled with numerous veins of shiny fat. All of the company's Iberian acorn-fed hams are cured for a minimum period of 36 months, while for some the curing process can last up to 120 months. Joselito's hams are from different years, so each one will have a different tasting evaluation.|$|E
