40|$|Abstract. A {{mobile agent}} is {{software}} which performs an action autonomously and independently {{as a person}} or organizations assistance. Mobile agents are used for searching information, retrieval information, filtering, intruder recognition in networks, and so on. One of the important issues of mobile agent is their security. It must consider different security issues in effective and secured usage of mobile agent. One of those issues is the <b>integrity’s</b> <b>protection</b> of mobile agents. In this paper, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each method, after reviewing the existing methods, is examined. Regarding to this matter that each method has its own advantage or disadvantage, it Seems that by combining these methods and using Agents Attributes one can reach to a better method for protecting the integrity of mobile agents. Therefore, this method is provided in this paper and then is evaluated in terms of existing method. Finally, this method is simulated and its results are the sign of improving the possibility of <b>integrity’s</b> <b>protection</b> of mobile agents...|$|R

Under these conditions, more freedom to waive rights of physical integrity can only place socially vulnerable persons at great risk of abuse...|$|R
