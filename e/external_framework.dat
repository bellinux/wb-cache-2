40|$|We {{examine the}} unique {{challenges}} pertaining to organizational governance and decision-making in Renewable Energy Cooperatives (REC). We find that internal governance frameworks often overrule competing <b>external</b> <b>frameworks,</b> leading to decision-making {{processes in the}} RECs that conflict with the <b>external</b> governance <b>framework</b> stipulated by law. Although results {{were based on a}} single-country (Germany) analysis of 15 different RECs, the data we gathered from 38 problem-centered interviews and 15 participant observations, when positioned within the broader context of social-political governance, reveal problems and challenges that likely pertain to all RECs. RECs have helped propel the energy transition, and now they are being challenged to integrate their sizable social capital into the broader energy system. Expertise is often called for beyond what a volunteer organization can support. This leads to strains in the democratic approach to decision-making. These strains can be analyzed using transaction cost theory. Efforts at transaction cost minimization lead to decisions being made by the internal governance framework, even though these decisions conflict with the existing governance framework stipulated by law. This perspective yields insight both for policy makers and for REC managers seeking paths to growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{plant disease}} {{triangle}} (PDT) {{is as old}} as the field of modern plant pathology, and it postulates that any plant disease is the outcome of the interaction between a pathogen, a host, and the environment. Recently, the need has emerged to study not only how the three elements of the PDT directly influence disease, but to focus on how they indirectly affect one another, consequently modifying the final outcome. It is also essential to structure such analyses within three major <b>external</b> <b>frameworks</b> provided by landscape level disturbances, climate change, and anthropogenic effects. The studies included in this issue cover a wide range of topics using an equally varied list of approaches, and they showcase the important role these indirect and often non-linear processes have on the development of forest diseases...|$|R
50|$|Now, assume {{one also}} desires {{the ability to}} add borders to windows. Again, the {{original}} Window class has no support. The ScrollingWindow subclass now poses a problem, because it has effectively created {{a new kind of}} window. If one wishes to add border support to many but not all windows, one must create subclasses WindowWithBorder and ScrollingWindowWithBorder etc. This problem gets worse with every new feature or window subtype to be added. For the decorator solution, we simply create a new BorderedWindowDecorator—at runtime, we can decorate existing windows with the ScrollingWindowDecorator or the BorderedWindowDecorator or both, as we see fit. Notice that if the functionality needs to be added to all Windows, you could modify the base class and that will do. On the other hand, sometimes (e.g., using <b>external</b> <b>frameworks)</b> it is not possible, legal, or convenient to modify the base class.|$|R

40|$|Indicators play an {{important}} role in the strategic assessment of policy packages. In this paper the role of indicators in assessing transport policies is examined. As case study, the European Common Transport Policy (CTP) is used. Its three main objectives may be summarized as 'efficiency', 'environment' and 'regional development'. Based on empirical research from different sources and the general CTP objectives, the main indicators for assessing the CTP are identified and discussed. Next, concise scenarios are constructed for the above mentioned general objectives within two general <b>external</b> <b>frameworks</b> (cooperation and polarisation), after which qualitative scores for the distinct indicators are calculated and presented. It appears that environmental and efficiency objectives may go hand in hand to some extent, especially by introducing price measures; regional development may however be contradictory with the achievement of the other objectives. It is concluded that indicators are a useful tool for assessing policy packages, by making the impacts of measures clearer and easily accessible for policy makers. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of how changes in the <b>external</b> accounting <b>framework</b> impacts an insurance company’s asset and liability management focusing on the asset side and credit risks. Method: This study has an actor’s approach. The theory and the empirical data have been approached consistently {{with the help of the}} model I designed. The design of the study is a case study with a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews. When collecting and analysing the empirical material the study has been influenced by a qualitative approach. Result & Conclusions: The study indicates that the insurance sector is using economic and solvent risk based valuations to manage and steer their business to profitability.    This study has clearly shown that reality mirrors the theory. However due to the volatility of the insurance market, stress testing supports the ALM requirements which is at the heart of an insurance company. Suggestions for future research: A suggestion would be to focus on internal controls used to implement such changes in <b>external</b> accounting <b>frameworks</b> which impact management accounting.   Such a focus would possibly be quite interesting to study and develop further.   Contributions of the thesis: This study contributed to how changes in the <b>external</b> accounting <b>framework</b> impacts an insurance company’s asset and liability management focusing on the asset side and credit risks. The study offers an appropriate setting to address the purpose, considering insurance companies have experienced significant changes that affect those factors in future years...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} some conceptual and practical tensions {{related to the}} application of the <b>external</b> governance <b>framework</b> to the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) in less motivated states, such as Belarus. First, it critically analyses the foundations of the <b>external</b> governance <b>framework</b> – from M.

Second, it argues that an understanding of specifically Belarusian ‘boundaries of order’ – geopolitics and culture – is essential for tailoring a more nuanced policy that will be able to accommodate the needs and interests of ‘less motivated’ ENP partner states. In conclusion, it is suggested that a new policy framework – of extended partnership – should be more technical and less political, based on horizontal networks of cooperation rather than on hitherto hierarchical governance by conditionality that has found little appeal in the less motivated neighbourhood. Can an Eastern Partnership framework become such an alternative...|$|R

5000|$|In this dual capacity, the shugo lords had {{to compete}} with other landed samurai in the provinces for land they {{administered}} as governors, but did not personally own. Like the noble proprietors, a single shugo lord owned lands in widely dispersed areas in several provinces. His power was not built upon personal ownership of land like the territorial lords (daimyo) of the sixteenth century, but upon the loyalties of the local samurai through ties of vassalage. [...] There was much greater coercive potential exercised by the territorial lords of the sixteenth century, because their ties of vassalage were based on their ownership of the lands around them: as owners they could dispense with the land as they saw fit, getting rid of recalcitrant vassals without much ado. In the fourteenth century, the shugo lords could not claim province wide ownership of territory: first, the concept of personal provincial ownership was as yet undeveloped; second, they never amassed large amounts of personal property, relying rather on using the traditional framework of estate lands and public lands to enfoeff their vassals. This is the central enigma of the fourteenth century: the fragmentation and dissolution of the estate system, and {{the disappearance of the}} civil administration coincided with the proliferation of private lands, but the <b>external</b> <b>framework</b> of the estate system (shōen) and the public lands system (kokugaryo), though devoid of content, still remained. [...] Given the fragmentation, it was the intermediary ties of shugo vassalage, and the shugo role as provincial governor, that helped to integrate the disparate forces to some degree.|$|E

40|$|Teacher {{education}} courses, {{and specifically}} literacy methods courses, {{can be viewed}} by many of us {{as a vehicle for}} “training ” college students to become skillful technicians in a career whose success is measured by accountability to standards set by NCLB and other <b>external</b> <b>frameworks.</b> They can also be viewed, however, as a space where individuals may discover the importance of human agency in the transformation and preservation of a democratic society. As outlined by many critical educators (Freire, 1970, Macedo, 1994, hooks 1994), a domesticating education prepares students to acquiesce reflexively to the dictates of authority figures, uncritically consume information, and feel no compulsion to question or act, whereas a liberating education would involve students in the transformation of self, of schools, and of the world. In this paper, we investigate the power of personal narrative as a transformative process, discovered through authoring “books ” – a practice in literacy methods course that may provide a means by which students can find their own voice and validate their stories as “texts ” that can then be used for a variety of purposes in literacy education.

40|$|Abstract]: Gartner Research {{suggests}} that many CEOs are interested to gain insights into existing and emerging legal frameworks for the Internet workforce. The main objective of gaining such insights is {{in order to develop}} enterprise’s management strategies suited to these legal frameworks that have a profound impact on organisations. In recent months, the behaviour of the workforce has come under scrutiny because of the increased use of various devices used to enable connecting to the Internet, and the cost associated with such connectivity. As these devices provide mobility to the workforce, they remove the distinction between private and professional workplaces, and facilitate the workforce to adapt their work styles according to external conditions in a flexible manner. These ‘flexible’ aspects have forced enterprises to support their work force with devices, tools, processes and collaborative internal and <b>external</b> <b>frameworks</b> in order to achieve efficiency. However, in real life environment, some of these frameworks may conflict with domestic and international laws, union agreements and other individual employment contracts. In the Internet domain, these issues also vary by regions, economic conditions and cultural attitudes.

This has resulted in examining the behaviour of the workforce because the increased use of various mobile devices may result in the removal of the distinction between private and professional workplaces. Further, this mobility sometimes dictates the workforce to adapt flexible work styles according to external conditions to realise efficiency gains.
