5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad is said to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages {{after the death of}} Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E

5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E
5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E

25|$|Except for Tiger and {{his brother}} Yakub, the entire family {{returned}} to India and were promptly arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 1994. Since then, Yakub was in custody and was undergoing treatment for depression. The Memon family was subsequently tried in court and found guilty of conspiracy.

25|$|Vietnamese prime {{minister}} Nguyễn Tấn Dũng had originally set an ambitious target {{to complete the}} line by 2013, three years sooner than the previously announced nine-year construction time. Later reports suggested Japanese development aid would only be available in stages, with completion of the line not expected until the mid-2030s; the same reports asserted that aid would be conditioned upon the export of Shinkansen technology. On June 19, 2010, after a month of deliberation, Vietnam's National Assembly rejected the high-speed rail proposal due to its high cost, leaving the project's future in doubt; National Assembly deputies are said to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> further study of the project.|$|E
25|$|Each episode {{should run}} for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under {{then it is}} the job of {{post-production}} to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, EastEnders: The First 10 Years, after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> further changes to be made. The episode was then copied onto D3 video. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the BBC's technical standard for broadcasting.|$|E
25|$|A {{year before}} this, Manchester would <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> and acted upon {{the advice of}} a capable soldier, such as Cromwell or Crawford. Now, however, his mind was warped by a desire for peace on any terms, and he sought only to avoid defeat, pending a happy {{solution}} of the quarrel. Those who sought to gain peace through victory were, meanwhile, driving Maurice back from hedge to hedge towards the open ground at Newbury. But every attempt to emerge from the lanes and fields was repulsed by the royal cavalry, and indeed, by every available man and horse. Charles's officers had gauged Manchester's intentions, and almost stripped the front of its defenders to stop Waller's advance. Nightfall {{put an end to the}} struggle around Newbury, and then too late, Manchester ordered the attack on Shaw House. It failed completely, in spite of the gallantry of his men, and darkness being then complete, it was not renewed.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 {{came the}} move that ended Rivers' {{longtime}} friendship with Johnny Carson, who had first hired {{her as a}} Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network {{announced that it was}} giving her a late night talk show, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, making Rivers the first woman to have her own late night talk show on a major network. The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, Johnny Carson: King of Late Night, Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the Tonight Show, a decision respected by Carson's first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's attorney Henry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, contrary to what Edgar had told Rivers. Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon's first episode. On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned for an interview.|$|E
500|$|The final witness was Handel Booth himself. Booth {{stated that}} he would never <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a ten-percent {{commission}} on the Birmingham contract, and that he had never claimed he could influence government ministers. Hastings showed the jury that both of these statements were lies, first by showing the piece of paper Booth had scribbled the [...] "Birmingham contract" [...] memo on and then by showing a telegram from Booth to Gruban in which Booth claimed that he [...] " [...] already spoken to a Cabinet Minister and high official".|$|E
500|$|In {{retaining}} the cup, Arsenal {{became the first}} team to do so since Tottenham Hotspur in 1982. Wenger commented after the game that his team [...] "got the trophy we wanted" [...] while Strachan was in admiration of Southampton's performance: [...] "I'm very proud of the way they competed. I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> any more." [...] Keown said the FA Cup win was [...] "the best ever" [...] and Seaman felt the disappointment of losing out to Manchester United in the league spurred the team on. Football pundits Alan Hansen, Peter Schmeichel and Mark Hughes unanimously agreed that Arsenal deserved to win the match.|$|E

50|$|The {{ammunition}} {{was bought}} {{three weeks before}} the crime from R. Mayer AG at the Basler Steinenvorstadt, and was likely to have been bought by Johnny. The shop assistant at R. Mayer AG recalled that the man who bought the ammunition <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> two packages of Kal. 38 Spez ammunition, with each package containing 50 rounds each. The customer <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> ammunition with extra heavy lead bullets, and <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> if the rounds would fit in his Italian Winchester rifles.

500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E

During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the [...] and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that [...] "The airplane... became the envy of pilots even from my background... there's {{an awful lot of}} things on the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking me ...

500|$|When the Korean animators were animating the {{sequence}} with Marge in the gun training course, {{they did not}} know how to correctly animate the [...] "shell com out of the gun" [...] because guns were illegal in Korea. They had to consult with the American animators, who advised them to watch movies so they could properly animate the guns. The original design for Marge's police uniform had Marge's hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made for awkward staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her hair pulled down. David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he would <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.|$|E
