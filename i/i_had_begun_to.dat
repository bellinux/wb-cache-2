500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> scribble something but it looks a bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

When I looked at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E

During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> hope that this curse had passed away from the family, {{and that it had}} ended with the last generation. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> take comfort too soon, however; {{yesterday}} morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father." ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR MAUD,--If {{you have}} {{forgotten}} the handwriting--as is like enough--you will find {{the name of a}} former correspondent (don't know how to spell that word) at the end. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> write to you before now, but always stuck somehow, and left it to drown in a drawerful of like fiascos.
