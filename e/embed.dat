5|$|To {{accomplish}} just-in-time weaving, {{a change}} to the virtual machine that executes the compiled bytecode is necessary. A proposed solution for AspectJ uses a layered approach which builds upon the existing Java Virtual Machine to add support for join point management and callbacks to a Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming Engine. An alternative implementation uses a weaving engine that uses breakpoints to halt execution at the pointcut, select an appropriate method, <b>embed</b> it into the application, and continue. The use of breakpoints in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce performance due to {{a very large number of}} context switches.|$|E

5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and <b>embed</b> itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
5|$|The second {{campaign}} {{reveals that}} Kerrigan was not {{killed by the}} Zerg, but rather is captured and infested {{in an effort to}} incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg's cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to <b>embed</b> itself into the crust of the planet.|$|E

The (multiplicative) relaxation of an ordinal <b>embedding</b> is the maximum ratio between two distances whose relative order is inverted by the <b>embedding.</b> We develop several worst-case bounds and approximation algorithms on ordinal <b>embedding.</b> In particular, we establish that ordinal <b>embedding</b> has many qualitative differences from metric <b>embedding,</b> and capture the ordinal behavior of ultrametrics and shortest-path metrics of unweighted trees. ...|$|R

An Open <b>Embedded</b> System Model (OESM) is currently being developed at NIST to provide a standard representation and exchange protocol for <b>embedded</b> systems and system-level design, simulation, and testing information.

The approach provides an object-oriented UML (Unified Modeling Language) representation for the <b>embedded</b> system feature model and defines an extension to the NIST Core Product Model. The model provides a feature-based component framework allowing the designer to develop a virtual <b>embedded</b> system prototype through assembling virtual components. The framework not only provides a formal precise model of the <b>embedded</b> system prototype but also offers the possibility of designing variation of prototypes whose members are derived by changing certain virtual components with different features.
