5|$|Women's {{health is}} {{positioned}} within a wider {{body of knowledge}} cited by, amongst others, the World Health Organisation, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.

5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities</b> often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{association}} of adolescent and parent diabetes distress with perceived consequences, dietary self-efficacy, and discrepancies in diabetes <b>family</b> <b>responsibility,</b> in type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). METHODS: 203 adolescents with T 1 D, aged 12 - 18, and their parents completed self-report questionnaires cross-sectionally. RESULTS: Higher HbA 1 c, greater perceived negative consequences of diabetes, and reduced self-efficacy predicted adolescent diabetes distress. Higher HbA 1 c predicted parental diabetes distress, as did diabetes <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> disagreements when both <b>family</b> members claimed <b>responsibility,</b> and parents' perception of reduced adolescent self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Dietary self-efficacy and perceived negative consequences of diabetes are important factors to consider in assessing and managing adolescent diabetes distress. Perceptions of <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> for self-care tasks and parental confidence in adolescents' self-management have implications for parental diabetes distress. Clinical implications support long-held recommendations of taking a family-perspective of T 1 D care...|$|R

25|$|A 2012 study, did a {{regional}} survey on farmers suicide in rural Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and applied a Smith's Saliency method to qualitatively rank the expressed causes among farming families {{who had lost}} someone to suicide. The expressed reasons in order of importance behind farmer suicides were – debt, alcohol addiction, environment, low produce prices, stress and <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private money lenders, use of chemical fertilizers and crop failure. In other words, debt to stress and <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were rated as significantly higher than fertilizers and crop failure. In a different study in the same region in 2006, indebtedness (87%) and deterioration in the economic status (74%) {{were found to be}} major risk factors for suicide.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{theories}} is the Disengagement Theory proposed in 1961.

40|$|For decades, Japanese {{governments have}} grappled {{with the issue}} how to {{formulate}} a policy response to population ageing and the rising need for long-term care. Public opinion can determine the borders to which reforms are feasible, but opinions about care for older persons have become increasingly diffuse {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century. We conduct latent class regression analyses on Japanese Generations and Gender Survey data (n = 8, 636) to identify moral beliefs about care for older people. Taking multiple dimensions—filial support, work and gender—into account conjointly, we identify three clearly distinct ideals. In the patriarchal high <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> ideal, it is deemed the responsibility of the eldest sons to make sure that parents are cared for. Daughters are expected to take on the bulk of the care tasks and paid work is deemed primarily a task for men. In the gender egalitarian low <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> ideal, neither eldest sons, nor daughters are considered to carry substantial caring responsibility. Upward intergenerational support is expected to be financial, rather than instrumental and paid work is considered a task for women as well as men. In the neutral ideal, people tend to be rather reserved about issues regarding filial norms, work and gender. Adherence to the gender egalitarian low <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> ideal is strong among women, the young and the highly educated. Men, older persons and people with lower levels of education are, in turn, relatively likely to adhere to the patriarchal high <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> ideal...|$|R

25|$|As <b>family</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and {{vocational}} pressures lessen, friendships become more important.

Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{positive}} press given to flexible work arrangements (FWA), empirical research investigating {{the link between}} the availability of these policies and work–family conflict is largely equivocal. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to begin to reconcile these mixed results through more precise measurement and the examination of moderators. Using a sample of employed women, we found that FWA relate more highly to work interference with family (WIF) than to family interference with work (FIW) and that temporal flexibility (flextime) has a stronger relationship with WIF than does spatial flexibility (flexplace). Additionally, we found <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> significantly moderated these relationships, such that the relationship was stronger for those with greater <b>family</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Practical and theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between individual differences and flexible work arrangement use. Three need-based motivational factors (need for affiliation at work, need for segmentation of work from other life roles, need for occupational achievement) were examined in relation to extent of flextime and flexplace use. Additionally, the moderating roles of an organizational variable (face-time orientation) and <b>family</b> variable (<b>family</b> <b>responsibility)</b> were tested. Using a sample of university faculty, we found that need for segmentation negatively related to both flextime and flexplace use as predicted. Some evidence for the moderating role of <b>family</b> <b>responsibility</b> was also found. The findings underscore the importance of considering both {{the individual and the}} environment as drivers of flexible policy use. Further implications and future directions are discussed...|$|R
