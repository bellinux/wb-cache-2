5000|$|One {{important}} {{area of research}} that arose from earlier studies at Manitoba Hydro was the recognition and need to quantitatively evaluate the operating risk associated with adding large generating units to a relatively small electric power utility. [...] This concern resulted in a major area of study on spinning or operating capacity reliability assessment that incorporated load forecast uncertainty, rapid start and <b>hot</b> <b>reserve</b> considerations, and the incorporation of interruptible loads. These studies were completed many years ago but are now being reconsidered and extended to incorporate renewable energy sources. The increasing penetration of wind power in modern electric power systems introduces new dimensions in risk evaluation in both the planning and operating domains. Considerable {{progress has been made}} in incorporating the inherent variability associated with wind power in both generating capacity adequacy and security evaluation.|$|E

The combustible gases that mainly contain CO {{can be used to}} feed a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The results of numerical calculations presented in the study demonstrated that cyclone furnace can operate over a wide range of fuel flow rates: from the conditions of coal dust combustion, which ensure maintaining the cyclone furnace in a state of <b>hot</b> <b>reserve</b> to the conditions of coal dust gasification, which allow for production of CO.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technical {{solution for the}} replacement of the excitation system of the unit B 1 in TPP 'Nikola Tesla B' {{as a part of the}} maintenance service in 2012. Since the generators of TPP 'Nikola Tesla B' have the greatest power in the power system of Serbia, it was necessary to achieve high reliability of the excitation system so that the process of producing electricity is not endangered Considering this, the implemented excitation system uses modern technology with redundancy both in the power and control blocks, which resulted in an increase in the <b>hot</b> <b>reserve</b> by 100 %. In addition, it was necessary to adjust the excitation system to increased generator power and performance from 618 MW to 667. 5 MW. In this paper, the main parameters of the excitation system are given: the power, the excitation system control, the thyristor ignition system, the event recorder system, the digital relay protection, as well as the measuring and signaling functions...|$|E

Different variants of fault-tolerant redundant configurations and maintenance strategies provide equivalent {{mean time to failure}} indexes, {{but at the same time}} have different values of the probability of failure-free operation at given operation time value.

Comparison of the reliability of uninterruptible power supply with different tolerant configurations. The quantitative difference between reliability indexes (operation time where probability of failure-free operation is not less than 0. 99) of corrective and ventive maintenance is shown.

50|$|Human {{habitation}} in {{this area}} {{can be traced back}} to 10,700 years BP with the retreat of the last great glaciation, and it is unlikely that the hot springs escaped being noticed. The first recorded reference to hot springs here is by James Hector of the Palliser Expedition in 1859, followed by Joe Healey in 1874 who found the Cave and Basin site in 1875. But it was Canadian Pacific Railway workers William McCardell and Frank McCabe who brought national attention to the Cave and Basin. In 1883 they descended through the skylight entrance into the cave using a felled tree, and the following year constructed a small cabin nearby with the intention of commercializing the Cave and Basin site. Conflicting claims by other parties prompted intervention by the Canadian government headed by John A. Macdonald, and in 1885 an order-in-council reserved 10 sq mi around the Cave and Basin, the Banff <b>Hot</b> Springs <b>Reserve.</b> This was the genesis of Canada's national parks system. In 1886 the Canadian government held an inquiry into the various private claims to settle on compensation.|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{research}} on the Shona novel has focussed on the influence of orature and the Bible. It has also focused on the influence that the Southern Rhodesia Literature Bureau had on its development. This research has endeavoured to highlight {{the reliability and validity of}} the Shona novel as a historical document. The dependability of the novel as an alternative site from which history can be deciphered is corroborated by historical documents. The history that comes out in the Shona novels that have been studied covers the pre-colonial period right up to the post-independence period. Among the issues that come up in the research that relate to history are the Rozvi state under Chirisamhuru, the economic activities in pre-colonial Shona society that include raids for cattle and women as well as hunting and external trade. The Shona novel has also proved historically reliable in as far as it relates to the navigability of the Save River. It has highlighted the living conditions and the wages that Blacks got in colonial Rhodesia and exposed the land imbalances that came into existence because of the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, which left Blacks living on the periphery and in overcrowded, <b>hot</b> and dry <b>reserves</b> that were hardly fertile. The Rhodesian authorities, as the novels have exposed, denied most Blacks access to education. When schools were provided, they were poorly staffed and those on farms functioned more as labour pools than schools. The novel has also proved its dependability when it highlights the early days of the nationalist movement and the unilateral declaration of independence of 1965. It has also brought to the fore the birth of the armed struggle and the Rhodesian responses to it. The Rhodesians responded politically and militarily. Politically, it was through the Internal Settlement Agreement of March 1978. Militarily they moved people into 'protected villages' in an effort to deny guerrillas access to food and clothing. The novel also highlights the post-independence period especially political intolerance. African LanguagesD. Litt. et Phil. (African Languages...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the activities and}} results of a typical plant powerhouse energy management survey. The powerhouse provides electrical energy, steam supply at two different pressure levels, and compressed air for the process plant. The owners had already performed energy loss surveys and implemented maintenance and energy management programs. The activities described include a follow-up survey and a concentration on {{the improvement of the}} boiler operations and efficiencies. The Input-Output and Heat Loss methods of determining boiler efficiency, in accordance with ANSI & ASME PTC 4. 1, are explained. A comparison of the methods, including a sensitivity analysis, shows the effects of measurement inaccuracies on each. Each boiler is studied and the required measurements identified and described. The importance of flue gas oxygen measurements is described along with the variations in readings obtained using dry or wet basis measurements. The existing operating efficiency of each boiler is determined and the effects of improved controls identified. The considerations for Security, Reliability, Maintainability, and Efficiency Improvement required by any control system are described. A control strategy is selected and hardware chosen to implement the improved boiler and overall steam generation performance. Focus is shifted from the single boiler problem to the requirements for optimal loading of each boiler to meet total system load requirements. The economics of multiple boiler loading is discussed with the introduction of the Cost Function. This permits direct comparison of boilers even when using different fuels of varying costs. Provisions are included for operator limits of each boiler. These limits are required to permit identification of maximum boiler steaming rates or to provide <b>hot</b> standby (spinning) <b>reserves.</b> Minimum limitations on boiler loading such as burner turn-down are also recognized. In addition, the amount of boiler bias or offset can be limited on a per boiler basis. Lastly. a comparison is made between the powerhouse operation initially, following installation of improved controls. and finally when optimal boiler loading is implemented...|$|R
