500|$|Mutya Buena, {{another member}} of the Sugababes, {{clarified}} Buchanan's encounter with the artist to Hot Press magazine's Jackie Hayden, saying: [...] "We all <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> going on between them at the time, but we try to give each other space." [...] She described [...] "Push the Button" [...] as a song [...] "with meaning and real life references", and characterised it as having a [...] "street vibe". Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London. [...] "Push the Button" [...] was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler. Rick Shepphard engineered the song.|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> about it. I've never heard anything like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)" [...] was {{actually}} inspired by her next-door neighbors' long lasting marriage, being {{the opposite of}} what tabloids fixate on. Swift wrote [...] "Our Song" [...] for her freshman year of high school talent show with no intentions of including it on the album. She claimed she [...] "just <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> about it" [...] and chose to include it on Taylor Swift. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one." [...] The song is a narrative and describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. The banjo-riddled song is placed {{at the end of the}} album due to its closing lyrics, a request to [...] "play it again". [...] "Invisible" [...] is ballad describing loneliness and heartache of going unnoticed. Sean Dooley of About.com writes, the [...] "piano-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endure—or have endured—at one time or another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{up between}} your crowd and the Merrick crowd," [...] said the youth. [...] "You <b>are</b> both after <b>something,</b> ain't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{sentiment}} was warmly echoed; and thus, {{when the}} determination {{at which the}} men had arrived to cut Bathurst became <b>known,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> like a feminine revolution.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let us {{hope that}} no news is good news," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "Anyway, I'm not going to worry until I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to worry about." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really {{interested}} in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] {{wanted to make a}} record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended {{to spend more time}} on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kitana {{was chosen}} as the best Mortal Kombat II fighter by the editors of Sega Power and Super Play for being [...] "good all around" [...] and due to her quick attacks and {{perceived}} similarities to Chun-Li. Amiga Power too called her [...] "a really good character to pick" [...] and Cinema Blend stated Kitana [...] "could absolutely dominate" [...] the game. However, GamePro's strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in MKII (citing her devastating combos, powerful [...] "Fan Throw" [...] move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by Complex, Kitana [...] "had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps." [...] "Kitana's big combos in the corner" [...] were among Ed Boon's own personal favourite things in the game: [...] "When I saw people do Kitana's combos I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> special, because people were taking the game to a new direction." [...] EGM described Kitana as [...] "a force to be reckoned with" [...] and predicted she would [...] "make a big impact as her Fan Wave leaves foes open to combos." [...] In the Game Gear version of MKII, however, Kitana's fan lifts the opponent too low and too far away for an easy combo.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Raymond! Raymond!" [...] {{she then}} said, in a husky dreamy voice, [...] "how good and kind you have <b>been.</b> I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{that would make}} you very, very glad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, what <b>is</b> it? I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> on {{your mind}} or {{you would not have}} summoned me in here. Is it about the trial? Have you seen Mr. Furnival again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> done--something done at Fleurieres. It was foul play. My father--something {{happened}} to him. I don't know; I have been ashamed--afraid to know. But I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something.</b> My mother knows--Urbain knows." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, mutely, because she <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong {{and that it}} was no use for her to ask what.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong. If he had injured {{somebody}} in England, {{he might have}} injured you. What made you so trustful?" ...|$|E
60|$|That's what you've been {{brooding}} {{over this}} last week, is it? Separation! I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something,</b> and I couldn't {{find out what}} it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to me? I {{should not}} like you the less for telling me. Do tell me." [...] And she pressed her hand again upon his arm. [...] "I have <b>known</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that made you unhappy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay {{here with}} your mistress," [...] he ordered, [...] "and keep quiet so she will sleep. If she wakes, {{give her the}} toddy. If she grows any weaker, let me <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> strange about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, wait!" [...] {{cried the}} girl. [...] "What are you doing---- You don't <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I must tell you--that {{will make you}} hate me----" [...] She {{struggled}} to begin somehow, {{but she did not}} know where.|$|R
6000|$|... "You poor baby," [...] she cried. [...] "Was {{that what}} was on your mind, {{wondering}} how you should tell me? I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> troubling you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> forgotten," [...] she said. [...] "You {{have been}} all {{this time in the}} house, and you have told me nothing. Begin directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{thinking}} of Norman--that made me sorry. I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> else, but you see I forget when I don't see you and Margaret every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look {{round the}} table," [...] she said. [...] "Aren't {{we all just}} odds and ends of humanity--the left-overs, you <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> inconglomerate about us. We are amiable to one another, but we don't mix. We can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{found out}} what Mrs. Lynde had to say when she came up that evening. Mrs. Lynde wasn't surprised! Mrs. Lynde had always {{expected}} something of the sort! Mrs. Lynde had always <b>known</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>SOMETHING</b> about Mr. Harrison! ...|$|R
50|$|As Alice completes {{her latest}} concert tour, David <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> wrong with her. He guesses {{she is in}} love with someone else, and calls off the engagement. Alice goes to see Ritter, who confesses what he has done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! well dear, I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> av that in it, {{and a nice}} {{handsome}} gentleman {{like the}} Captain wouldn't be trating the likes of you that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thomson?" [...] he repeated. [...] "My God! I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I {{meant to}} tell you. Don't you know, Ronnie?--but {{of course you}} don't. You're sure it's Thomson--Surgeon-Major Thomson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|James {{rose from}} his chair. [...] "There!" [...] he said, [...] "there! I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wro...." [...] He checked himself, and was silent, staring before him, {{as though he had}} seen a portent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Adolphus," [...] {{said the}} countess, putting {{out her hand}} to him. [...] "But stop a minute; I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I {{want you to do}} for me. But you will look in as you go to your office to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{what are}} you and papa plotting?" [...] asked Hedwig. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> going on. I {{suspected}} it when papa brought Werner Stauffacher and the other man here, and you wouldn't let me listen. What is it? Some dangerous scheme, I suppose?" ...|$|R
50|$|Albert Campion wakes in {{hospital}} suffering from amnesia. He <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> vital he must do, but he cannot {{remember what it}} is - or even his own name.

60|$|Mrs. Lynde came up {{the next}} {{afternoon}} {{to find out why}} Marilla had not been at the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Marilla was not at Aid meeting people <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong at Green Gables.|$|E
60|$|He's been {{brooding}} over it. I {{know him}} so well, I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{he was thinking}} over. Oh, John, I couldn't live without him. I'd rather die. If he leaves me, I swear I'll kill myself.|$|E
50|$|Car {{mechanic}} Mercy Thompson {{has always}} <b>known</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> different about her, {{and not just}} the way she can make a VW engine sit up and beg. Mercy is a shapeshifter, a talent she inherited from her long-gone father. She's never known any others of her kind. Until now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} why I came," [...] said the famous {{physician}} to Dr. Abraham Rowell of Tarleton, [...] "I never shall <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about that man Jethro Bass which compels you to do his will. He has a most extraordinary personality. Is this storekeeper a great friend of his?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--there is fire," [...] he said, blowing with {{tremendous}} energy until flame was produced. [...] "And, do you <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> within me {{that has a}} loud voice, but only utters one word--`Food! food! food!' There, now, you may get the birds ready, for the fire {{will be ready for}} them in two winks." ...|$|R
