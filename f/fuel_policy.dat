40|$|The {{search for}} {{alternative}} fuels and new fuel resources {{is a top}} priority for Turkey, {{as is the case}} in the majority of countries throughout the world. The <b>fuel</b> <b>policies</b> pursued by governmental or civil authorities are of key importance in the success of alternative fuel use, especially for widespread and efficient use. Following the 1973 petroleum crisis, many users in Turkey, especially in transportation sector, searched for alternative fuels and forms of transportation. Gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines between the mid- 1970 s and mid- 1980 s. In addition, natural gas was introduced to the Turkish market for heating in the early 1990 s. Liquid petroleum gas was put into use in the mid- 1990 s, and bio-diesel was introduced into the market for transportation in 2003. However, after long periods of indifference governmental action, guidance and <b>fuel</b> <b>policies</b> were so weak that they did not make sense. Entrepreneurs and users experienced great economical losses and lost confidence in future attempts to search for other possible alternatives.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} of an association between fine particulate matter less than 2. 5 Î¼m (PM 2. 5) in aerodynamic diameter and adverse health outcomes. This study analyzes the global excess mortality attributable to the aviation sector in the present (2006) {{and in the future}} (three 2050 scenarios) using the integrated exposure response model that was also used in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease assessment. The PM 2. 5 concentrations for the present and future scenarios were calculated using aviation emission inventories developed by the Volpe National Trans-portation Systems Center and a global chemistry-climate model. We found that while excess mortality due to the aviation sector emissions is greater in 2050 compared to 2006, improved <b>fuel</b> <b>policies</b> (technology and operations improvements yielding smaller increases in fuel burn compared to 2006, and conversion to fully sustainable fuels) in 2050 could lead to 72 % fewer deaths for adults 25 years and older than a 2050 scenario with no fuel improvements.

40|$|In March 2001, the South Australian Government {{introduced}} a clean <b>fuel</b> <b>policy</b> which it claimed {{was designed to}} protect air quality. This paper quantifies the policy's impact on relative Adelaide retail prices for unleaded petrol through Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average methodology coupled with Box and Tiao intervention analysis. The analysis uses weekly price data spanning from January 2000 {{until the beginning of}} June 2002. It finds the clean <b>fuel</b> <b>policy</b> had a statistically significant impact on relative retail petrol prices, resulting in an increase of almost 1. 9 cents per litre and, therefore, costing Adelaide motorists around an extra $ 15. 8 million per annum. Based on claims that the quality of fuel produced by the local Adelaide refiner did not change in response to the implementation of the clean <b>fuel</b> <b>policy,</b> the paper concludes that the increase in relative retail petrol prices was most likely associated with the exercise of market power rather than an increase in refinery production costs.
