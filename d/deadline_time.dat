While deadline can’t totally shut off transactions and has no effect on real time, it can effectively shut off most other processing in the system if necessary to achieve its goal.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose task {{scheduling}} algorithms that minimize energy or minimize power for the case when the tasks have different arrival <b>times,</b> <b>deadline</b> <b>times,</b> execution times and switching activities.

INTRODUCTION Energy minimization is critically important for portable devices running on batteries. Substantial energy minimization can be achieved without sacrificing performance by lowering the supply voltage (and thus slowing the clock) instead of idling when the computational load of a task is low [1]. Thus determining the supply voltage of the processor as it executes tasks with different computational loads such that the energy consumption is minimum (without sac [...] ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effects of superior preference and information source on staff auditor reporting decisions in the presence of <b>time</b> <b>deadline</b> pressure. Prior research suggests that superior preference, information source, and <b>time</b> <b>deadline</b> pressure provide incentives for auditors to withhold information from their superiors. In the presence of <b>time</b> <b>deadline</b> pressure, staff auditors are expected to be more willing to report client-provided information concerning subjective audit issues than self-discovered information, especially if the senior emphasizes meeting the deadline. Sixty-seven graduate and upper-level undergraduate accounting students, serving as proxies for staff auditors, participated in a between-subjects experiment. The majority of participants reported information concerning a subjective audit issue regardless of senior preference, information source, and <b>time</b> <b>deadline</b> pressure. The results suggest that participants were motivated by both a desire to avoid responsibility for decisions concerning subjective audit issues and audit quality concerns. This study adds to a growing body of literature that suggests that undesirable auditor behavior that may result in audit failures does not begin at the staff level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we study}} model {{checking}} of compositional real-time systems. A system is modeled using mutable data variables {{as well as}} a compositional timed process. Instead of explicitly manipulating clock variables, a number of compositional timed behavioral patterns are used to capture quantitative timing requirements, e. g. delay, timeout, <b>deadline,</b> <b>timed</b> interrupt, etc. A fully automated abstraction technique is developed to build an abstract finite state machine from the model. The idea is to dynamically create/delete clocks, and maintain/solve a constraint on the clocks. The abstract machine weakly bi-simulates the model and, therefore, LTL model checking or trace-refinement checking are sound and complete. We enhance our home-grown PAT model checker with the technique and show its usability via the verification of benchmark systems. ...|$|R

50|$|Timeboxes {{are used}} {{as a form of}} risk management, to {{explicitly}} identify uncertain task/time relationships, i.e., work that may easily extend past its <b>deadline.</b> <b>Time</b> constraints are often a primary driver in planning and should not be changed without considering project or sub-project critical paths. That is, it's usually important to meet deadlines. Risk factors for missed deadlines can include complications upstream of the project, planning errors within the project, team-related issues, or faulty execution of the plan. Upstream issues might include changes in project mission or backing/support from management. A common planning error is inadequate task breakdown, which can lead to underestimation of the time required to perform the work. Team-related issues can include trouble with inter-team communication; lack of experience or required cross-functionality; lack of commitment/drive/motivation (i.e. poor team building and management).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose {{variable}} voltage task scheduling algorithms that minimize energy or minimize peak power for the case when the task arrival <b>times,</b> <b>deadline</b> <b>times,</b> execution times, periods and switching activities are given. We consider aperiodic (earliest due date, earliest deadline first), as well as periodic (rate monotonic, earliest deadline first) scheduling algorithms. We use the Lagrange multiplier method to theoretically determine {{the relation between the}} task voltages such that the energy or peak power is minimum, and then develop an iterative algorithm that tries to satisfy the relation. We propose two implementations of the iterative algorithm: a low complexity one and an exact one. The asymptotic complexity of the existing scheduling algorithms change very mildly with the application of the proposed algorithms. We show experimentally (random experiments as well as real-life cases), that the voltage assignment obtained by the proposed low complexity algorithm is very close to that of the optimal energy (0. 1 % error) and optimal peak power (1 % error) assignment. Furthermore, we consider the e#ect of the delay to change the converter voltage and the clock frequency...|$|R
