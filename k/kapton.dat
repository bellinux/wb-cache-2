5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with <b>Kapton</b> tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

25|$|<b>Kapton</b> tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this tape is that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to <b>Kapton</b> tape is that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, <b>Kapton,</b> Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.|$|E
25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or <b>Kapton,</b> woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
2500|$|Polyimide (PI), a {{thermoplastic}} polymer of imide monomers, {{is proposed}} for film capacitors called Polyimide-, PI- or <b>Kapton</b> capacitors. <b>Kapton</b> is the trade name of polyimide from DuPont.

2500|$|Aluminium {{was widely}} used in the speaker {{industry}} due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them. [...] Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the magnetic gap creates eddy currents within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long-term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed <b>Kapton,</b> a polyimide plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium's deficiencies, so <b>Kapton,</b> and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the temperature resistance and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300°C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker's 'cold' frequency response.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kapton</b> and ABS {{adhere to}} each other very well, {{which has led to}} {{widespread}} use of <b>Kapton</b> as a build surface for 3D printers. <b>Kapton</b> is laid down on a flat surface and the ABS is extruded on to the <b>Kapton</b> surface. The ABS part being printed will not detach from the build platform as it cools and shrinks, a common cause of print failure by warping of the part.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{its large}} range of {{temperature}} stability, and its electrical isolation ability, <b>Kapton</b> tape is usually used in electronic manufacturing as an insulation and protection layer on electrostatic sensitive and fragile components. As it can sustain the temperature needed for a reflow soldering operation, its protection is available throughout the whole production process, and <b>Kapton</b> is often still present in the final consumer product.|$|E
50|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of <b>Kapton</b> at temperatures from 0.5 to 5 Kelvin is rather high for such low temperatures, κ = 4.638×10−3 T0.5678 W·m−1·K−1. This, together with its good dielectric qualities and its availability as thin sheets {{have made it}} a favorite material in cryogenics, as it provides electrical insulation at low thermal gradients. <b>Kapton</b> is regularly used as an insulator in ultra-high vacuum environments due to its low outgassing rate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chemical}} name for <b>Kapton</b> K and HN is poly (4,4'-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide). It is produced from the condensation of pyromellitic dianhydride and 4,4'-oxydiphenylamine. <b>Kapton</b> synthesis {{is an example}} of the use of a [...] in step polymerization. The intermediate polymer, known as a [...] "poly(amic acid)", is soluble because of strong hydrogen bonds to the polar solvents usually employed in the reaction. The ring closure is carried out at high temperatures (200-300 °C, 473-573 K).|$|E
50|$|For use in space, {{polyimide}} (e.g. <b>kapton,</b> UPILEX) substrate {{is usually}} employed {{due to its}} resistance to the hostile space environment, large temperature range (cryogenic to −260 °C and for short excursions up to over 480 °C), low outgassing (making it suitable for vacuum use) and resistance to ultraviolet radiation.

There is also a narrow lower-fixed radiator shade, also made of coated <b>Kapton</b> membrane. The coating of the membrane is silicon and VPA. Other areas of the outside are covered with JWST multi-layer insulation (MLI).|$|E
5000|$|Many plastics, namely many plastic tapes (special {{attention}} should be paid to adhesives). Fiberglass composites, e.g. Micarta (G-10) and G-30, should be avoided. Even <b>kapton</b> and teflon are sometimes advised against.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{material}} of the sunshield is the material <b>Kapton</b> coated with aluminum, {{and the two}} closest layers to the Sun are also doped with silicon.
