What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

After several delays, the album Way Beyond Blue was released on 30 September. There were 12 tracks, several of which had appeared on previous EPs and as b-sides to singles. On the background of the successful album, there were problems behind the scenes. Matthews and Roberts relationship broke down, with Roberts ending it and seeing someone else within days. The duo sought to keep the band together despite the problems, and they found a way to continue working together. Warner Bros.

She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they wouldn't have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as [...] "Road Rage" [...] which references emotional anger. The line [...] "If it turns to blue, what are we going to do?" [...] in the single [...] "You've Got A Lot To Answer For" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Way</b> Beyond Blue references a pregnancy test.

[...] The full album played was Springsteen's first, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which he wryly said [...] "was the miracle.

[...] The performance of it was dedicated to his first manager and producer, Mike Appel, who was present in the audience, and featured quite rare renditions of [...] "Mary Queen of Arkansas" [...] and (the first ever with the E Street Band) [...] "The Angel".

[...] The tour finished not with the emotional statement in song that some other Springsteen tours have in the 2000s, but instead with John Fogerty's [...] "Rockin' All Over the World".|$|E
