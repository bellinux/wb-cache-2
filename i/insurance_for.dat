40|$|Abstract: The paper {{represents}} an {{analysis in the}} domain of the social <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care. It emphasizes the necessity and the opportunity of creating in Romania a medical service market based on the competing system. In Romania, the social <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care are at their very beginning. The development of the domain of the private <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care is prevented even by its legislation, {{due to the lack of}} a normative act that may regulate the management of the private <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care. The establishment of the legislation related to the optional <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care might lead to some activity norms for the companies which carry out optional <b>insurances</b> <b>for</b> health care. The change of the legislation is made in order to create normative and financial opportunities for the development of the optional medical insurances. This change, as part of the social protection of people, will positively influence the development of the medical insurance system. The extension of the segment of the optional insurances into the medical insurance segment increases the health protection budget with the value of the financial sources which do not belong to the budgetary funds...|$|R

5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, the roots {{of which can be}} traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> all factory workers and craftsmen.

In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare, representing a decline from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from public sources.

At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
