500|$|The both {{versions}} of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, {{in order to make}} the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with acrylic paint and then digitized by the Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created [...] "huge" [...] DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256 color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors). The game also uses various digitized sound effects. Allison said, [...] "there were whole sections that never made it in, like a roller skating frankenstein, that shattered into loads of tiny versions of him if you 'killed' <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the sprites etc, it just never made it to the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Pol Pot said nothing. They made {{it clear}} and I {{believed}} them, that I was to interview Pol Pot after the trial. Pol Pot literally had to be carried away from the trial—he was unable to walk—and I {{was not able to}} talk to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> try to talk to him... he did not answer any questions, and he did not speak during the trial.

6000|$|... "I <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> make {{no mystery}} about that to you. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love <b>him</b> {{with all my}} heart. <b>I</b> love <b>him</b> to-day, now that <b>I</b> believe <b>him</b> to be here, and that I suppose <b>I</b> shall see <b>him,</b> perhaps this very afternoon.

That is why I have decided to go to the Tower." ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2007, Plame {{addressed}} the question while testifying before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: [...] "I did not recommend <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I {{did not have}} the authority.... It's been borne out in the testimony during the Libby trial, and I can tell you that it just doesn't square with the facts." [...] She described that in February 2002, while discussing an inquiry from the office of Vice President Cheney about the alleged Iraqi uranium purchases, a colleague who knew of her husband's diplomatic background and previous work with the CIA suggested sending him, and that she agreed to facilitate the discussion between her husband and her superiors despite her own ambivalence about the idea.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bear with <b>him!</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} exactly what you mean. Of course I will {{remember}} that he is an old man, and not answer <b>him</b> as <b>I</b> would one of my own age." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Papa {{will never}} hear of it--never--never! You don't know <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> He is either biassed {{in favour of}} a thing, or prejudiced against it. Argument is {{powerless}} against either feeling.' ...|$|R
