[...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> notoriety rather than fame. This poor child {{has a right to}} herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E

6000|$|WISE MAN [turning {{over the}} pages of a book]. Where is that passage I am to explain to my pupils to-day? Here it is, and the book says that it was written by a beggar on the walls of Babylon: [...] "There are two living countries, the one visible and the one invisible; and when it is winter with us it is summer in that country; and when the November winds are up among us it is lambing-time there." [...] I wish that my pupils had asked me to explain any other passage, for this is a hard passage. [The FOOL comes in and stands at the door, holding out his hat. He has a pair of shears in the other hand.] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> foolishness; and yet that cannot be, for the writer of this book, where I have found so much knowledge, would not have set it by itself on this page, and {{surrounded}} it with so many images and so many deep colors and so much fine gilding, if it had been foolishness.|$|E

5000|$|The Swiss theologian Emil Brunner, who had {{frequently}} acknowledged {{his debt}} to Buchman, {{also tried to}} dissuade Buchman from his efforts to convert the Nazi leadership {{on the basis that}} he was endangering the reputation of himself and his work. Buchman replied to Brunner: [...] "Your danger is that you are still the Professor thundering from the pulpit and want the theologically perfect. But the German Church crisis will never be solved this way. Just think of your sentence, 'Unfortunately this hopeless fellow Hossenfelder has damaged the reputation of the Groups.' <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> associating with 'publicans and sinners.'

I've said it before but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a band imploding and losing focus. The next record will redeem the sound I believe was lost during the Violence/Skeletons cycle. Too many cooks in the kitchen can sometimes create a mediocre meal. Especially when the cooks come from different schools." [...] The album is considered the band's most diverse release to date, with its music drawing elements from genres such as hardcore and thrash metal. The album's lyrics are also more political than previous Nothingface releases. Lyrical themes on the album include the invasion of Afghanistan, organized religion, murder and the American government. The song [...] "Ether" [...] is about George W. Bush and his Middle East policies. The song [...] "Here Comes the Butchers" [...] is about Catholicism and Catholic Church sexual abuse cases.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 the Cobb County {{school board}} {{required}} stickers {{placed in a}} science textbook. Stating that evolution was [...] "a theory, not a fact," [...] the sticker {{was placed in the}} ninth-grade biology text after parents complained to the Cobb County school board that alternative ideas about the origin of life were not presented. A group of parents represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the school board, claiming the stickers violate {{the separation of church and}} state. The trial was resolved in January 2005 when U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled the sticker was unconstitutional. In the verdict he wrote, [...] "By denigrating evolution, the school board appears to be endorsing the well-known prevailing alternative theory, creationism or variations thereof, even though the sticker does not specifically reference any alternative theories." [...] In December 2005 the federal appeal court panel made comments sharply criticising the lower court ruling in advance of releasing their decision. Judge Ed Carnes said that the words on the sticker are [...] "technically accurate," [...] and that [...] "From nonlife to life is the greatest gap in scientific theory. There is less evidence supporting it than there is for other theories. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> evolution is more vulnerable and deserves more critical thinking," [...] suggesting that he did not understand the distinction between evolution and abiogenesis. [...] In December 2006 Cobb County School Board agreed to settle the long-running legal case. The county will not order the placement of [...] "any stickers, labels, stamps, inscriptions, or other warnings or disclaimers bearing language substantially similar to that used on the sticker that is the subject of this action." ...|$|E

60|$|An ear {{for music}} is a very {{different}} thing from a taste for music.

Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ...
