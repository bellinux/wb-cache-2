5|$|While NY32 officially remains {{concurrent}} with NY299 {{all the way}} to {{the traffic}} light at the northern terminus of NY208, a sign at the Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E
5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water and saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia {{went on to win the}} relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, {{and seeing the}} American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics {{was the only time}} that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by {{an allergy}} to chlorine. As a result, {{he did not}} swim in his first race until a school {{carnival}} {{at the age of}} seven. The allergy forced Thorpe to swim with his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{team made}} a poor {{start in the}} final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had {{occurred}} after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory {{was the first time that}} Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time that this has been achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.|$|E

25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to keep moving {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bag {{just as they were}} boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{reveals that}} he plans to destroy the Patriots' core AI with a nuclear strike using Metal Gear REX's railgun, and that he will {{substitute}} the core with his own to gain control. To facilitate his plan, Liquid needs a non ID-tagged nuclear warhead, which is to be recovered from the Shadow Moses facility, familiar to Snake from prior adventures. Snake, tormented by old memories, infiltrates Shadow Moses Island and reaches REX's hangar only to be ambushed by Vamp who has Naomi with him. Raiden assists Snake in battling Vamp and ultimately kills him. Naomi, revealing she is riddled with cancer and tormented by her mistakes, disables her nanomachines holding off the cancer and dies. Snake and Raiden use REX to <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hangar and battle Metal Gear RAY, piloted by Liquid. Upon his defeat, Liquid reveals Outer Haven, a modified version of Arsenal Gear ready to fulfill his launch plan. Raiden is severely injured during the attack while defending Snake. The , captained by Mei Ling, arrives and begins firing on Haven, causing it to retreat. Seizing the moment it surfaces to launch the nuke, Snake, Meryl, and Johnny board the ship via catapults. When Snake arrives at the core, he uses Otacon's robot to install a computer virus coded by Naomi and Sunny, that destroys the core AI and the Patriot system controlling the entire world, leaving the bare necessity for the modern civilization to survive. The destruction of the Patriots brings the war economy to a halt, counteracts the Patriots' upcoming civilian control scheme, and causes a mental breakdown for the enemy soldiers as their mind-control systems are disabled. Snake, after passing out in the core room, awakes atop Outer Haven's tower to find Liquid. Liquid reveals to Snake that his plan the whole time was to have Snake himself defeat the Patriots while Liquid draw their attention to himself. Liquid also reveals to Snake that Eva died because of the FOXDIE virus Snake is carrying. The two engage in a tough and emotional battle, with Snake coming up on top. After telling Snake a few last words, Liquid dies from the Foxdie virus as well.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{between the}} two sides reached a peak between 12:00 and 12:30pm, but at 12:50 smoke was seen coming from the building's {{chimneys}} and from the second floor windows; it has not been established how the fire was started, whether by accident or design. The fire slowly spread, and by 1:30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors.

The koala has one of the lowest milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mammal. The female makes up for this by lactating for as long as 12 months.

At 13 weeks, the joey weighs around [...] and its head has doubled in size. The eyes begin to open and fine fur grows on the forehead, nape, shoulders, and arms.

2500|$|Though Nell Gwyn {{was often}} caricatured as an empty-headed woman, John Dryden {{said that her}} {{greatest}} attribute was her native wit, and she certainly became a hostess {{who was able to}} keep the friendship of Dryden, the playwright Aphra Behn, William Ley, 4th Earl of Marlborough (another lover), John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the king's other mistresses. She is especially remembered for one particularly apt witticism, which was recounted in the memoirs of the Comte de Gramont, remembering the events of 1681:Nell Gwynn was one day passing through the streets of Oxford, in her coach, when the mob mistaking her for her rival, the Duchess of Portsmouth, commenced hooting and loading her with every opprobrious epithet.
