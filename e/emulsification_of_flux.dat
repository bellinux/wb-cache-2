40|$|Background: Oxane HD® is a "heavier-than-water" {{silicone}} oil {{which has a}} specific gravity of 1. 02 g/cm 3. When dispersed into droplets, one expects them to sink. We report a case <b>of</b> <b>emulsification</b> <b>of</b> Oxane HD in an eye that unexpectedly manifested as an "inverted hypopyon". Methods: The clinical findings of a 45 -year-old man who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and Oxane HD endotamponade for a phakic inferior rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are described. Results: A large {{silicone oil}} globule was noted to be floating in the anterior chamber on postoperative day 1. <b>Emulsification</b> <b>of</b> the globule and inverted hypopyon formation were subsequently observed at 2 months postoperatively.

40|$|Gum arabic {{is widely}} used in the food {{industry}} as an additive, both as a thickener and an emulsifier. This study has compared the <b>emulsification</b> properties <b>of</b> two types of gums, KLTA (Acacia senegal) and GCA (Acacia seyal), both in their native/untreated forms and after exposure to high pressure (800 MPa).

40|$|Recently, {{much effort}} {{has been given to}} {{development}} and/or optimization of porous materials with requirements for intended applications in catalysis, filtration, isolation, etc. In this context, this paper presents processing conditions and the correspondent characterization of cellular ceramics processed by extrusion of ceramic emulsions, obtained by <b>emulsification</b> <b>of</b> red clay, kaolin and alumina suspensions, after sintering at different temperatures. The <b>emulsification</b> <b>of</b> the ceramic suspension in paraffin with a melting point higher than room temperature is the key for the success of this processing method due to the freezing of the organic droplets allowing good stability of matrix during the extrusion process. Experimental results show good microstructural stability, yielding cellular ceramics with mechanical strength up to 30 MPa, permeability up to 3 x 10 (- 4) m s(- 1), and thermal conductivity lower than 0. 25 W m(- 1) K- 1, framed with mentioned applications.

40|$|Emulsification using {{electric}} fields {{is an easy}} {{alternative to}} flow-induced drop breakup, and the former {{is reported to be}} more effective and economical than the latter, especially when the medium phase is poorly conducting and highly viscous.

An average size of a few microns of the dispersed phase could be achieved. New breakup mechanisms at play in the emulsification process are discussed. Identified mechanisms involve charged lobe disintegration, charged drop breakup, chain formation in which several water droplets are interconnected by thin water bridges, electrospraying and charge transfer, and coalescence.
