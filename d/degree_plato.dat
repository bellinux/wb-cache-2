40|$|Flavor compounds` {{formation}} and fermentative parameters of continuous high gravity brewing with yeasts immobilized on spent grains were evaluated at three different temperatures (7, 10 and 15 degrees C). The assays were {{performed in a}} bubble column reactor at constant dilution rate (0. 05 h(- 1)) and total gas flow rate (240 ml/min of CO(2) and 10 ml/min of air), with high-gravity all-malt wort (15 <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato).</b> The results revealed that as the fermentation temperature was increased from 7 to 15 degrees C, the apparent and real degrees of fermentation, rate of extract consumption, ethanol volumetric productivity and consumption of free amino nitrogen (FAN) increased. In addition, beer produced at 15 degrees C presented a higher alcohols to esters ratio (2. 2 - 2. 4 : 1) similar to the optimum values described in the literature. It was thus concluded that primary high-gravity (15 <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato)</b> all-malt wort fermentation by continuous process with yeasts immobilized on spent grains, {{can be carried out}} with a good performance at 15 degrees C...|$|R
50|$|Helles-style beers {{typically}} are full-bodied, mildly sweet, and light-colored, with low bitterness. The beer is clear due to filtration prior to bottling, although some restaurants and breweries do offer an unfiltered version.

In continental Europe, the density of a beer in <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato</b> is sometimes used by a brewery to distinguish a particular beer produced in a line. For example, Rochefort Brewery produces three beers, all dissimilar in colour, flavour, and aroma; and sells them as Rochefort 6, Rochefort 8, and Rochefort 10, the numbers referring to the original gravities of the beers. Westvleteren Brewery, meanwhile, produces three beers, and calls them Blonde, 8, and 12.|$|R
500|$|The {{strength}} of beers has climbed during the later {{years of the}} 20th century. Vetter 33, a 10.5% abv (33 <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato,</b> hence Vetter [...] "33") doppelbock, was listed in the 1994 Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest beer at that time, though Samichlaus, by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann, had also been listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest at 14% abv. Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with Millennium, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with Utopias. The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer. In September 2011, the Scottish brewery BrewDog produced Ghost Deer, which, at 28%, they {{claim to be the}} world's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone.|$|R

40|$|To save energy, space, and time, today's breweries {{make use}} of high-gravity brewing in which {{concentrated}} medium (wort) is fermented, resulting in a product with higher ethanol content. After fermentation, the product is diluted to obtain beer with the desired alcohol content. While economically desirable, the use of wort with an even higher sugar concentration {{is limited by the}} inability of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) to efficiently ferment such concentrated medium. Here, we describe a successful strategy to obtain yeast variants with significantly improved fermentation capacity under high-gravity conditions. We isolated better performing variants of the industrial lager strain CMBS 33 by subjecting a pool of UV-induced variants to consecutive rounds of fermentation in very-high-gravity wort (> 22 <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato).</b> Two variants (GT 336 and GT 344) showing faster fermentation rates and/or more-complete attenuation as well as improved viability under high ethanol conditions were identified. The variants displayed the same advantages in a pilot-scale stirred fermenter under high-gravity conditions at 11 degrees C. Microarray analysis identified several genes whose altered expression may be responsible for the superior performance of the variants. The role of some of these candidate genes was confirmed by genetic transformation. Our study shows that proper selection conditions allow the isolation of variants of commercial brewer's yeast with superior fermentation characteristics. Moreover, it is the first study to identify genes that affect fermentation performance under high-gravity conditions. The results are of interest to the beer and bioethanol industries, where the use of more-concentrated medium is economically advantageous. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Normal-gravity (22 to 24 <b>degrees</b> <b>Plato)</b> wheat mashes were inoculated {{with five}} industrially {{important}} strains of lactobacilli at approximately 10 (5), approximately 10 (6), approximately 10 (7), approximately 10 (8), and approximately 10 (9) CFU/ml {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} the lactobacilli on yeast growth and ethanol productivity. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus # 3, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus fermentum were used. Controls with yeast cells but no bacterial inoculation and additional treatments with bacteria alone inoculated at approximately 10 (7) CFU/ml of mash were included. Decreased ethanol yields were due to the diversion of carbohydrates for bacterial growth and the production of lactic acid. As higher numbers of the bacteria were produced (depending on the strain), 1 to 1. 5 % (wt/vol) lactic acid resulted in the case of homofermentative organisms. L. fermentum, a heterofermentative organism, produced only 0. 5 % (wt/vol) lactic acid. When L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. fermentum were inoculated at approximately 10 (6) CFU/ml, an approximately 2 % decrease in the final ethanol concentration was observed. Smaller initial numbers (only 10 (5) CFU/ml) of L. paracasei or Lactobacillus # 3 were sufficient to cause more than 2 % decreases in the final ethanol concentrations measured compared to the control. Such effects after an inoculation of only 10 (5) CFU/ml may have been due to the higher tolerance to ethanol of the latter two bacteria, to the more rapid adaptation (shorter lag phase) of these two industrial organisms to fermentation conditions, and/or to their more rapid growth and metabolism. When up to 10 (9) CFU of bacteria/ml was present in mash, approximately 3. 8 to 7. 6 % reductions in ethanol concentration occurred depending on the strain. Production of lactic acid and a suspected competition with yeast cells for essential growth factors in the fermenting medium were the major reasons for reductions in yeast growth and final ethanol yield when lactic acid bacteria were present...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{recognition of}} Plato's Republic as a pedagogical text {{and of the}} milieu of competing disciplines in which it composed suggests new readings of its philosophical content. I contend that {{close attention to the}} cultural context in which the Republic was written reveals the degree to which its arguments were constructed not only with an eye towards the philosophical demands put upon it, but also in response to the claims of epistemological authority made by other fields. Furthermore, I show that close attention to the pedagogical function of the text reveals the <b>degree</b> to which <b>Plato</b> relies upon the dialogue's characters and figurative language to entice students away from alternative pursuits and world-views and towards Platonic philosophy. 	The Republic was constructed in a revolutionary period for both texts and teachers, in which texts were beginning to function as a kind of tutor. In my first chapter, "Educating Athens", I survey the changing Athenian attitudes towards education from the sixth to the fourth centuries BCE, with a special focus on the rise of the concept of paideia. I also consider some {{of the ways in which}} earlier scholars have regarded the Republic as a prescriptive text on education in order to distinguish their approaches from my own: unlike these earlier readings, my approach to the text is to regard it as itself educating the reader, rather than as describing a system of education. The development of systems of paideia is intimately connected to the phenomena discussed in my second chapter: the rise of disciplines and the explosion of the written word. I conduct a historical survey of the evidence for literacy and texts in the seventh to fourth centuries BCE and show that the gradual increase in texts and literacy did not replace oral culture in Athens, but rather supplemented it. I point out striking similarities among medical texts, oratorical works, and the Socratic dialogues written by Plato's contemporaries as a basis for comparison with Plato's Republic. 	In the final three chapters of my dissertation I examine three aspects of Plato's Republic which have presented problems for envisioning the Republic as a unified work. My third chapter examines the Socratic interlocutors of book one as negative models for the reader, and shows that by the end of the book Plato has demonstrated the importance of passion, creativity, and deference in the successful philosophical student. As well, I suggest that Plato deliberately shows the weaknesses of the elenchus in the first book in order to argue against the methodologies of his fellow authors of Socratic dialogues, and in order to showcase the new philosophical methods which he displays in the remainder of the Republic. In the fourth chapter I continue to emphasize the relationship between the philosophy of the Republic and the work's pedagogical mission by examining the "two starts" to the Republic at the beginning of book 2 and book 5. I show that important work is done in books 2 - 4 to prepare the reader for the radical reevaluation of knowledge that will come in books 5 - 7 In the fifth chapter I consider the use of stories within the Republic, and what such stories can tell us both about Plato's theories of how education occurs as well as about how the Republic is meant to function. 	Ultimately my dissertation demonstrates that by locating the Republic within the intersection of competing pedagogies, new disciplines, and the recent rise of texts, the text can be understood as functioning on a number of different levels. It dismisses the merits of other disciplines and privileges Plato over other philosophers, all within the structure of a work which is gradually molding and guiding its reader towards Plato's particular ethical and epistemological system. Although the Republic has been read as a work on ethics, on political philosophy, and on psychology, its disparate components and topics coalesce only by reading it first as a work which educates.
