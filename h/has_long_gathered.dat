60|$|It lasted four days, {{by which}} time the last bunch, save those on a few vines {{preserved}} for eating, was picked and crushed; and the vats in the cellar, sunk underground for coolness, were full to the brim.

2500|$|Six {{species of}} tree {{are found in}} Tierra del Fuego: canelo or winter's bark [...] (Drimys winteri), Maytenus magellanica, Pilgerodendron uviferum, the {{southern}}most conifer in the world, and three kinds of southern beech: Nothofagus antarctica, Nothofagus pumilio, and the evergreen Nothofagus betuloides. Several kinds of fruit grow in open spaces in these forests, such as beach strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis var. chiloensis forma chiloensis) and calafate (Berberis buxifolia), which <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been <b>gathered</b> by both Native Americans and residents of European descent. These forests are unique {{in the world for}} having developed in a climate with such cold summers. Tree cover extends very close to the southernmost tip of South America. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow into twisted shapes, inspiring people to call them [...] "flag-trees". Tree vegetation extends as far south as the Isla de los Estados, Navarino Island, and the northern part of Hoste Island.

40|$|Natural {{populations of}} oysters and mussels <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been <b>gathered</b> for food by coastal {{communities}} in the Philippines, and bivalve farming began in early 1900. The first farms {{were no more than}} a series of bamboo poles inserted in the muddy bottom of Manila Bay in Bacoor Cavite. In May 1934, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) established a pilot oyster farm in Binakayan, Cavite Province, Luzon, and a lucrative industry soon grew up. By 1950, about 200 ha of private farms existed in Bacoor Bay, but, in the late 1950 s, mussels appeared on the farms and threatened the industry. The response of BFAR was to initiate farms for mussels, and the results prompted the establishment of a mussel industry that proved to be at least as lucrative as the oyster industry. Farming of windowpane oysters (Placuna placenta) began in the late 1940 s in the tide flats of Bacoor Bay, the delicate, translucent Placuna shells being used for window glazing and shellcraft. In the early 1970 s, however, the bay became increasingly polluted, the stocks could not survive, and they are still not found in the waters of the bay...|$|R
6000|$|Unlike most Boers {{of similar}} descent, these {{particular}} Marais--for, of course, {{there are many}} other families so called--never forgot their origin. Indeed, from father to son, they kept up some knowledge of the French tongue, and among themselves often spoke it after a fashion. At any rate, it was the habit of Henri Marais, who was excessively religious, to read his chapter of the Bible (which it is, or was, the custom of the Boers to spell out every morning, should their learning allow them to do so), not in the [...] "taal" [...] or patois Dutch, but in good old French. I have the very book from which he used to read now, for, curiously enough, in after years, when all these events <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been <b>gathered</b> to the past, I chanced to buy it among a parcel of other works at the weekly auction of odds and ends on the market square of Maritzburg. I remember that when I opened the great tome, bound over the original leather boards in buckskin, and discovered to whom it had belonged, I burst into tears. There was no doubt about it, for, as was customary in old days, this Bible had sundry fly-leaves sewn up with it for the purpose of the recording of events important to its owner.|$|R

60|$|The deep {{projection}} of the second story gave the house such a meditative look, {{that you could not}} pass it without the idea that it had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon. In front, just {{on the edge of the}} unpaved sidewalk, grew the Pyncheon Elm, which, in reference to such trees as one usually meets with, might well be termed gigantic. It had been planted by a great-grandson of the first Pyncheon, and, though now four-score years of age, or perhaps nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity, throwing its shadow from side to side of the street, overtopping the seven gables, and sweeping the whole black roof with its pendant foliage. It gave beauty to the old edifice, and seemed to make it a part of nature. The street having been widened about forty years ago, the front gable was now precisely on a line with it. On either side extended a ruinous wooden fence of open lattice-work, through which could be seen a grassy yard, and, especially in the angles of the building, an enormous fertility of burdocks, with leaves, it is hardly an exaggeration to say, two or three feet long. Behind the house there appeared to be a garden, which undoubtedly had once been extensive, but was now infringed upon by other enclosures, or shut in by habitations and outbuildings that stood on another street. It would be an omission, trifling, indeed, but unpardonable, were we to forget the green moss that <b>had</b> <b>long</b> since <b>gathered</b> over the projections of the windows, and on the slopes of the roof nor must we fail to direct the reader's eye to a crop, not of weeds, but flower-shrubs, which were growing aloft in the air, not a great way from the chimney, in the nook between two of the gables. They were called Alice's Posies. The tradition was, that a certain Alice Pyncheon had flung up the seeds, in sport, and that the dust of the street and the decay of the roof gradually formed a kind of soil for them, out of which they grew, when Alice <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been in her grave. However the flowers might have come there, it was both sad and sweet to observe how Nature adopted to herself this desolate, decaying, gusty, rusty old house of the Pyncheon family; and how the ever-returning Summer did her best to gladden it with tender beauty, and grew melancholy in the effort.|$|R
