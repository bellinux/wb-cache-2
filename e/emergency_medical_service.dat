5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{dispatch}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> at {{the onset}} of acute stroke is vital in expediting assessment and treatment. We examined the relationship between callers' description of potential stroke symptoms to the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher and the subsequent classification and prioritisation of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> response. AIM: To identify key 'indicator' words used by people making emergency calls for suspected stroke, comparing these with the subsequent category of response given by the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher. METHOD: A retrospective chart review (hospital and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services)</b> in North West England (October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007) identified digitally recorded <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> calls, which related to patients who had a diagnosis of suspected stroke at some point on the stroke pathway (from the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> call taker through to final medical diagnosis). Using content analysis, words used to describe stroke by the caller were recorded. A second researcher independently followed the same procedure in order to produce a list of 'indicator' words. Description of stroke-specific and nonstroke-specific problems reported by the caller was compared with subsequent <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> dispatch coding and demographic features. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-three calls were made to <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> of which 592 (92...|$|R
