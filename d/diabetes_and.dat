40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} social disadvantage and family composition on <b>diabetes</b> prevalence <b>and</b> <b>diabetes</b> care outcome.  DESIGN—Retrospective audit in the south west of England of 801 children with diabetes mellitus.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Prevalence of diabetes {{in relation to the}} Townsend index. Admissions to hospital with diabetes related problems, glycated haemoglobin, time spent in hospital, outpatient attendance rates.  RESULTS—There was no association between social status <b>and</b> <b>diabetes</b> prevalence. Social deprivation increased the likelihood of admission for hypoglycaemia. Children living with a single parent {{were more likely to be}} admitted to hospital with a <b>diabetes</b> related problem <b>and</b> stay in hospital longer. Having either a parent with diabetes or a single parent increased the rates of clinic non-attendance. No association was identified between medium term <b>diabetes</b> control <b>and</b> either social disadvantage or single parent status.  CONCLUSIONS—Social disadvantage has no effect on <b>diabetes</b> prevalence <b>and</b> little on <b>diabetes</b> outcome in childhood. Family structure <b>and</b> parental <b>diabetes</b> have adverse effects on some aspects of diabetes outcome. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist.

While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> osteoporosis.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV).

Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with <b>diabetes</b> <b>and</b> amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men.

40|$|Purpose of reviewTo review {{recently}} published studies examining {{the role of}} prepregnancy obesity {{in the relationship between}} gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> childhood obesity. Recent findingsSeven epidemiologic studies published from January 2011 to February 2012 differentiate between preexisting <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, <b>and</b> six of them examine the role of maternal obesity. In studies that account for maternal obesity as a covariate, the association between gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> childhood obesity is attenuated significantly after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI. In the one study that does not adjust for maternal obesity, maternal glucose level during pregnancy is associated with greater offspring adiposity, independent of the child 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s diet and lifestyle. SummaryThis review shows a positive association between maternal gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> offspring overweight and obesity that is attenuated significantly after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI. The relationship between maternal gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> offspring overweight and obesity could reflect fetal programming, shared genes and/or shared environments, such as postnatal diet and physical activity. Maternal gestational hyperglycemia and subsequent fetal hyperinsulinemia may predispose offspring to increased adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. Because maternal obesity is a more prevalent condition than gestational <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>and</b> strongly associated with offspring obesity, effective interventions addressing prepregnancy obesity need to be further explored as they may have a greater public health impact on childhood overweight and obesity than those targeting women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
