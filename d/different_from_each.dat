5|$|Any {{pretense of}} cordiality between Cope and Marsh ended in 1872, and by spring 1873 open hostility ensued. At the same time, Leidy, Cope and Marsh were making great discoveries of ancient {{reptiles}} and mammals in the Western bone beds. The paleontologists {{had a habit}} of making hasty telegrams eastward describing their finds, only publishing fuller accounts after returning from trips. Among the new specimens described by the men were Uintatherium, Loxolophodon, Eobasileus, Dinoceras, and Tinoceras. The problem was that many of these finds were not uniquely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other; in fact, Cope and Marsh knew that some of the fossils they were collecting had already been found by the others. As it turned out, many of Marsh's names were valid, while none of Cope's were. Marsh also placed the new species into a new order of mammals, Cinocerea. Cope was humiliated and powerless to stop his rival's changes. Instead, he published a broad analytical study where he proposed a new plan of classification for the Eocene mammals, in which he discarded Marsh's genera in favor of his own. Marsh remained steadfast and continued to claim that all of Cope's names for Dinocerata were incorrect.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E

5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{in medical}} genetics is {{the condition of}} having two heterogeneous recessive alleles at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state.

Compound heterozygosity reflects {{the diversity of the}} mutation base for many autosomal recessive genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated alleles, who technically are heterozygotes, but both the alleles are defective.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong the {{multiple}} factors {{involved in the}} decline of amphibians, competition with alien species remains understudied. In Western Europe, non-native marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus and other sister species) have been widely imported for gastronomic purposes and have then often escaped from captivity. Apart from closely related species, {{the impact of the}} subsequent colonization of non-native species on native amphibians is still unknown. In this study, we analysed the response of a threatened species, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata), faced with the presence of alien frogs in mountain rivers in France. We studied the co-occurrence pattern of the native toad and the alien frog, while taking into account co-dependence of the detection rates in both species. We tested three main scenarios to explain a non-random pond occur- rence for each species and to establish their respective habitat preferenda: (1) a pond-area-dependent scenario, predicting <b>different</b> responses <b>from</b> <b>each</b> species for a given pond size, (2) a fish-dependent scenario, predict- ing <b>different</b> responses <b>from</b> <b>each</b> species given the presence of fish in ponds, and (3) a floodplain-width- dependent scenario, predicting <b>different</b> responses <b>from</b> <b>each</b> species given the geomorphological characteristics of the floodplain. Taking into account site-specific covariates, we concluded that introduced frogs do not currently {{have an impact on the}} native population of the yellow-bellied toad...|$|R
