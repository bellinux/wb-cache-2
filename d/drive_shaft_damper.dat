40|$|Sound in {{our society}} is {{beginning}} to be a health hazard in many places. This leads to legislation and recommendations by public authorities and governments. For a truck the sound pressure level should not exceed 80 dB(A) during a drive-by test set by international standards. This leads to development of the noise for the truck, and different parts get their own allowed component noise level. This thesis will {{look at one of}} these parts, i. e. the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> The goal is to find a test method for controlling the <b>damping</b> in the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> for quality purposes. An additional goal is to see if the method also could secure the target value for the sound pressure level in a drive-by test. Using cardboard tubes inside the <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> <b>damps</b> them. In the cases where the <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> do not fulfil their target value in a drive-by test, an idea is that the insertion of the cardboard tubes has not worked properly. This calls for a test method for quality purposes and the suggested one is measuring the reverberation time. The manufacturer of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> wants to make the measurements on the steel tube after the cardboard tubes are mounted, but before the universal joints are welded to the steel tube. To determine the measuring method a lot of measurements are made. The purposes are to decide the excitation tool,the attachment of the detection tool and the measurement position. The measurements on the steel tube should be related to the drive-by measurements. Comparisons have been made between measurements on the steel tube, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> mounted in the truck. Simple Finite Element Method models are made to see the mode shapes between a steel tube and a drive shaft,since {{it is difficult to see}} this result in the measurements. The result shows that the bending modes change much in frequency while the ringing modes are rather stable. Evaluations are made for the drive-by measurements with differently <b>damped</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> The result showed no clear difference between the tested shafts and the method cannot be used to secure the radiated sound pressure level during a drive-by test. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> losses have been measured using two methods, the backward integration on the Impulse Response and the half power bandwidth method on the Frequency Response Function. Both these methods can be used to obtain the reverberation time to control the steel tubes to secure the damping for them, if the disadvantages in the methods is known and taken into account. However I recommend the half power bandwidth method since it gives more information of the <b>drive</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R

The purpose of this device is to back-drill pilot holes inside a commercial airplane wing. It is lightweight, and a “locator pin” enables the operator to align the drill over a pilot hole. A suction pad stabilizes the system, and an air motor and flexible <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> power the drill. Two testing procedures were performed to determine the practicality of this prototype. The first was the “offset drill test”, which qualified the exit hole position error due to an initial position error relative to the original pilot hole. The results displayed a linear relationship, and {{it was determined that}} position errors of less than. 060 ” would prevent the need for rework, with errors of up to. 030 ” considered acceptable. For the second test, a series of holes were drilled with the pneumatic tool and analyzed for position error, diameter range, and cycle time. The position errors and hole diameter range were within the allowed tolerances. The average cycle time was 45 seconds, 73 percent of which was for drilling the hole, and 27 percent of which was for positioning the device. Recommended improvements are discussed in the conclusion, and include a more durable flexible <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> a <b>damper</b> for drill feed control, and a more stable locator pin...|$|R

Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency.

Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.
