Despite the strong link between mortality and malignancy, the mechanisms behind pancreatic cancer dissemination and metastasis are poorly understood. Correlative pathological and cell culture analyses suggest the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 plays a biological role in pancreatic cancer progression. In vivo roles for the CXCR 4 ligand CXCL 12 in pancreatic cancer malignancy were investigated. CXCR 4 and CXCR 7 were consistently expressed in normal and cancerous pancreatic ductal epithelium, established cell lines, and patient-derived primary cancer cells. Relative to healthy exocrine ducts, CXCL 12 expression was pathologically repressed in pancreatic cancer tissue specimens and patient-derived cell lines. To test the functional consequences of CXCL 12 silencing, pancreatic cancer cell lines stably expressingthe chemokine were engineered. Consistent with {{a role for}} CXCL 12 as a tumor suppressor, cells producing the chemokine wereincreasingly adherent and migration deficient in vitro and poorly metastatic in vivo, compared to control cells. Further, CXCL 12 reintroduction significantly reduced tumor growth in vitro, with significantly smaller tumors in vivo, leading to a pronounced survival advantage in a preclinical model.

In this study we have investigated the synthesis, degradation, endocytosis, and activity of ENaC {{and the effects of}} aldosterone on these processes using endogenous channels expressed in the A 6 cell line. Biochemical studies were performed with a newly raised set of specific antibodies against each of the three subunits of the amphibian ENaC. Our results indicate simultaneous transcription and translation of α, β, and γ subunits and enhancement of both processes by aldosterone: two- and fourfold increase, respectively. The biosynthesis of new channels can be followed by acquisition of endoglycosidase H–resistant oligosacharides in α and β subunits and, in the case of α, by the appearance of a form resistant to reducing agents. The half-life of the total pool of subunits (t 1 / 2 40 – 70 min) is longer than the fraction of channels in the apical membrane (t 1 / 2 12 – 17 min). Aldosterone induces a fourfold increase in the abundance of the three subunits in the apical membrane without significant changes in the open probability, kinetics of single channels, or in the rate of degradation of ENaC subunits. Accordingly, the aldosterone response could be accounted by an increase in the abundance of apical channels due, at least in part, to de novo synthesis of subunits...|$|R

Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists, which may reduce the level of metabolic "stress" on acinar cells, have been shown to mitigate the severity of acute pancreatitis in a number of models. Not all studies have shown a benefit, however, and differences may exist between different structural classes of antagonists. Because increased pancreatic stimulation due to loss of feedback inhibition of CCK has been proposed to contribute to the pain of some patients with chronic pancreatitis, CCK receptor antagonists could also be of benefit in this setting. Somatostatin and its analogs diminish pancreatic secretion of water and electrolytes and have been effective in treating pancreatic fistulas and pseudocysts. These agents are also being evaluated for their ability to reduce pain in chronic pancreatitis (perhaps by reducing ductal pressure by diminishing secretory volume) and mitigating the severity of acute pancreatitis (possibly by reducing the metabolic load on acinar cells).

A water-selective channel, the aquaporin CHIP, was recently described in several epithelia, so {{we tested the}} hypothesis that osmotic water movement by cholangiocytes is mediated by CHIP. Isolated rodent cholangiocytes showed a rapid increase in volume {{in the presence of}} hypotonic extracellular buffers; the ratio of osmotic to diffusional permeability coefficients was > 10. The osmotically induced increase in cholangiocyte volume was inversely proportional to buffer osmolality, independent of temperature, and reversibly blocked by HgCl 2. Also, the luminal area of isolated, enclosed bile duct units increased after exposure to hypotonic buffer and was reversibly inhibited by HgCl 2. RNase protection assays, anti-CHIP immunoblots, and immunocytochemistry confirmed that CHIP transcript and protein were present in isolated cholangiocytes but not in hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that (i) isolated cholangiocytes and intact, polarized bile duct units manifest rapid, mercury-sensitive increases in cell size and luminal area, respectively, in response to osmotic gradients and (ii) isolated cholangiocytes express aquaporin CHIP at both the mRNA and the protein level. The data implicate aquaporin water channels in the transcellular movement of water across cholangiocytes lining intrahepatic bile ducts and provide a plausible molecular explanation for ductal water secretion. ...|$|R

In the present work, laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is applied to the most significant pressure gradient case, in order to obtain a more thorough knowledge of the near-wall flow field. Velocity and turbulence profiles are determined up to the near-wall region in order to provide an in-depth analysis of turbulent boundary layer at separation conditions, with and without application of control devices.

We used immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro perfusion of renal tubules to investigate water channel regulation in collecting ducts of diabetes insipidus (Brattleboro) rats treated with a 5 -day infusion of AVP or vehicle. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that collecting ducts of vehicle-infused Brattleboro rats had markedly reduced expression of AQP-CD relative to normal rats. In response to AVP infusion there was a nearly 3 -fold increase in AQP-CD expression as detected by immunoblotting. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the increased expression was predominantly in the apical plasma membrane and subapical vesicles of collecting duct cells. Inner medullary collecting ducts of AVP-infused Brattleboro rats displayed a 3 -fold increase in osmotic water permeability relative to vehicle-infused controls, in parallel with the change in AQP-CD expression.

Cortical expression of pendrin was regulated on mRNA and protein level. The combination of NaHCO 3 and DOCA enhanced pendrin mRNA and protein levels, whereas DOCA or NaHCO 3 alone had no effect.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{vasopressin}} in rodent collecting <b>ducts</b> to <b>regulate</b> water permeability depends {{in part on}} increases in phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) at three sites: Ser 256, Ser 264, and Ser 269. Previous studies of AQP 2 phosphorylation have depended largely on qualitative data using protein mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies. Here, we use a new method employing phospho-specific antibodies to determine the percentage of total AQP 2 phosphorylated at each site in the presence and absence of the V 2 -receptor-selective vasopressin analog dDAVP in rat renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) and cultured mpkCCD cells. Phosphorylation of Ser 269, a site previously implicated in plasma membrane retention, was found to increase from 3 to 26 % of total AQP 2 in rat IMCD cells following dDAVP. Quantification of immunogold labeling of the opposite kidneys from the same rats estimated that 11 % of total AQP 2 {{is present in the}} apical plasma membrane (APM) without injection of dDAVP and 25 % is present in the APM after dDAVP. Surprisingly, the baseline level of Ser 256 phosphorylation was constitutively high, and there was no increase with dDAVP (confirmed in 2 more sets of rats). In general, Ser 264 phosphorylation remained below 5 % of total. The pattern of response was similar in cultured mpkCCD cells (large increase in Ser 269 phosphorylation following dDAVP, but constitutively high levels of Ser 256 phosphorylation). We suggest from these studies that Ser 269 phosphorylation may be a more consistent indicator of vasopressin action and AQP 2 membrane abundance than is Ser 256 phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaporation}} duct climatology {{is constructed}} for the Gulf of Aden using a 31 -year high-resolution data set from the climate reanalysis product National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. The climatology reveals spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the evaporation <b>duct</b> height (EDH) <b>regulated</b> by the strong interplay between the seasonal monsoon reversals {{and the related}} atmospheric and oceanic responses. It also reveals that the Gulf of Aden exhibits a special EDH distribution that is distinct from the adjacent Arabian Sea when the south-west monsoon dominates the gulf. Under these conditions, the EDH of the entire gulf is significantly {{higher than that of}} the adjoining Arabian Sea. A cliff-style EDH drop (referred to as the EDH cliff) forms {{at the mouth of the}} Gulf of Aden. Furthermore, the influence of the EDH cliff on marine radar was investigated using a ray-optics method. Based on the analysis, it was found that the local EDH significantly affects the radar detection ability beneath the evaporation duct for ships sailing in the Gulf of Aden...|$|R
40|$|A serine/threonine kinase Akt {{is a key}} {{mediator}} {{in various}} signaling pathways including regulation of renal tubular transport. In proximal tubules, Akt mediates insulin signaling via insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS 2) and stimulates sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe 1), resulting in increased sodium reabsorption. In insulin resistance, the IRS 2 in kidney cortex is exceptionally preserved and may mediate the stimulatory effect of insulin on NBCe 1 to cause hypertension in diabetes via sodium retention. Likewise, in distal convoluted tubules and cortical collecting ducts, insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation mediates several hormonal signals to enhance sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activities, resulting in increased sodium reabsorption. Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK 1) mediates aldosterone signaling. Insulin can stimulate SGK 1 to exert various effects on renal transporters. In renal cortical collecting <b>ducts,</b> SGK 1 <b>regulates</b> the expression level of ENaC through inhibition of its degradation. In addition, SGK 1 and Akt cooperatively regulate potassium secretion by renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK). Moreover, sodium-proton exchanger 3 (NHE 3) in proximal tubules is possibly activated by SGK 1. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding of the roles of Akt and SGK 1 in the regulation of renal tubular transport...|$|R
