The use of coal does, however, cause various environmental damages due to pollution externalities and emissions; these are impacts that place strains and limitations on the use of other natural assets beyond the mere extraction thereof. These social costs have not been internalised by industry though and therefore this paper examines the cost of these environmental externalities that arise through the combustion of coal by South African industries. Though the paper alludes to the local impact of volatile matter and sulphur, {{the focus is on the}} cost of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. It is concluded that the monetary values of these externalities are significant and that the environmentally <b>inclusive</b> <b>price</b> (including negative environmental externalities) of coal is appreciably higher than the private or market price thereof paid by each respective industry...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate over the value of {{preferential}} trade programs offered by industrial countries, granting duty-free or reduced-duty access for many exports from developing countries. 1 Some leaders from developing countries and nongovernmental organizations have argued that preference erosion would have serious development consequences and requires compensation (e. g., Oxfam 2005). Other leaders have argued that vulnerability to preference erosion is lim-ited to only a few countries and products, and thus requires more targeted assist-ance (WTO 2004). A country that is granted trade preferences would presumably see demand for its exports grow, relative to demand for exports from countries still facing most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs. If the country receiving preferences is small, its exports {{would continue to be}} sold in the importing country at the prevailing tariff- <b>inclusive</b> <b>price,</b> with the exporter earning the difference.

40|$|Background and Problem: Major {{motorsport}} {{events are}} under siege. Creating {{social and environmental}} value without sacrificing financial profitability remains unsolved. Successful creation of such is termed Shared Value creation. Recently, Formula One was acquired by Liberty Media, emphasising value creation for the longer-term in an industry which is extremely profitable, albeit subject to critique for not creating enough social and environmental value. Formula E {{can be found on}} the other end of the spectrum, a new motorsport founded in 2014. Compared to Formula One, value creation for the long-term lies within the vision of Formula E. However, Formula E is yet to make such value creation financially profitable. This Master’s thesis takes on these problems, investigating how trade-offs between social, environmental and economic value can be minimised. Purpose: How major motorsport events can make the future business case by creating economic, social and environmental value integratively. Methodology: Given the unit of analysis (major motorsport events), the research method included a qualitative single case study with embedded units. Theory was utilised and extended in accordance to abduction and hermeneutics. The data was collected through 37 semi-structured interviews with respondents actively present within Formula One and Formula E. Due to the systematic scope of the study, the data was interpreted and analysed through conceptual mapping. Results and Conclusion: Embracing road relevance and motorsports as a platform for innovation can derive financial profitability from environmental value creation. Creating social value through <b>inclusive</b> <b>pricing,</b> fair competition for teams, edutainment, and legacies can boost market growth. Albeit, Shared Value creation must be implemented collectively throughout the stakeholder sphere to maximise its effects. To facilitate resource allocation and risk sharing, backbone organisations are required. Global stakeholders ought to utilise franchise systems as backbone structures, local stakeholders are advised to create event management companies. The transformations are to be initiated and lead by influential stakeholders; the international governing body and commercial rights holders specifically. Such norm-making shall inspire other stakeholders to follow. A medium-term focus on profitability and shared visions must be emphasised, favouring emergent solutions. Consequently, Bengtsson and Markovski (2017) propose Collective Shared Value Creation in a Glocal Ecosystem as the solution major motorsport events’ long-term viability.

The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is the underlying theory under this approach. Ross (1976) developed APT, which underpins this approach. The theory holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modeled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors (e.g., inflation, gross domestic product, and oil prices). APT is an alternative model that potentially overcomes the capital asset pricing model’s problems while retaining its underlying message. The core idea of APT is {{that only a small}} number of systematic influences affect the long term average returns of securities.|$|R

40|$|Printed {{advertisements}} in media {{are designed to}} draw attention of audiences. Readers can browse printed advertisements at the pace one feels comfortable with, and can read, pause, and re-read without being forced to. One particular service utilizing printed magazine advertisements for information dissemination is tour packages. Since services are typically considered riskier than products in decisions, consumers may need to evaluate specific information for service purchases. Printed magazine advertisements are suitable for travel agencies to deliver detailed information like itinerary, prices, and credibility of agencies for consumers to evaluate alternatives while searching relevant information of tour packages. This study was undertaken to examine effectiveness of information commonly provided in printed travel advertisements and further to reveal how consumers'' purchase intentions were influenced upon receiving printed advertising information of tour packages. The study used a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design {{to assess the impact}} of different advertising information on purchase intentions. Different combinations of itinerary (complete, incomplete), <b>price</b> (<b>inclusive,</b> partitioned), and corporate credibility (high, low) information were designed in printed magazine advertisements of tour packages for the consumer survey. Based on the results of this study, itinerary is the most important information to influence consumers' purchase intentions, followed by agency and price information. Complete itinerary information would generate higher purchase intentions than incomplete itinerary information. Advertisements with <b>inclusive</b> <b>prices</b> would lead to higher purchase intentions than partitioned prices. Corporate credibility also played an important role to influence consumers'' decisions. An important finding in this study was that the interaction of itinerary information and corporate credibility on purchase intentions was not statistically significant, suggesting that a high level of corporate credibility would not enhance the influence of itinerary information on purchasing intentions. Similarly, the interaction of price information and corporate credibility on purchase intentions was not statistically significant, suggesting that a high level of corporate credibility would not enhance the influence of price information on purchasing intentions. The results implied that no matter the corporate credibility of travel agency was high or low, providing complete itinerary information would be of a better strategy in marketing.

A recent survey done in the United States by the Funeral Consumers Alliance show that 23% of funeral homes are not telling people about their direct cremation options (Doughty). The fact that funeral homes purposely do not share viable and important information with clients puts them in direct violation of laws set by the Federal Trade Commission (Doughty). Possibly worse is the 22 present of funeral homes that advertise direct cremation cost without including the price of the actual cremation (Doughty). In this case, the funeral home uses an offsite third party crematory and approximately includes an additional 400 dollars to a fee that should have been all <b>inclusive</b> (Doughty). The <b>price</b> of an all-inclusive direct cremation should be between 700 and 1200 dollars (Doughty).

40|$|Abstract: CCS (carbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage) {{is an issue}} which has {{received}} increasing attention in the debate on climate change {{over the last several}} years because of its relative technical simplicity and very large potential in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The absence of secondary benefits and uncertainties associated with this approach, however, would require analysts to conduct fine costbenefit comparisons vis-à-vis other mitigation options. The paper is to provide a perspective on future cost-benefit discussions of CCS by highlighting the optimality of CCS use viewed as a non-renewable resource with a limited capacity. Scarcity of CCS (storage) capacity should involve a shadow price which could raise CCS’s effective price – this is a fair assumption given the technological assessments of CCS so far, but no economic study has explicitly investigated this characteristic before. By using a simple analytical dynamic optimization model, we examine the optimal paths of CCS use, CCS’s real <b>price</b> <b>inclusive</b> of the shadow price, and their difference from the operational price. A particular implication of the model is that if all else is equal, the shadow price of CCS could make the technology relatively less attractive than renewable energy due to CCS’s reliance on scarce reservoirs and the resultant shadow value. This serves as a justification for giving differentiated incentives to different CO 2 reduction options: more precisely, more encouragement should be given to renewable energy in comparison to CCS...|$|R

The selection processes in {{the public and private sectors}} have, however, remained largely disconnected, and at times contradictory. Medicines provided outside of hospitals accounted for 17 % of medical aid spend in 2006, up 8. 8 % from the previous year. Of particular concern to funders has been the expenditure on the 27 chronic conditions listed as Prescribed Minimum Benefits. The Medical Schemes Act (No 131 of 1998) provides for the definition of Prescribed Minimum Benefits, which stipulate a package of services or care a medical scheme must provide for in its benefit design. There is pressure to reconsider these requirements in order to increase the affordability of medical scheme coverage. This study assessed the potential savings that would be achievable by substituting generics for brand name (originator) medicines listed in the chronic disease algorithms set out by the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS). Methods: All medicines listed in the 25 chronic diseases algorithms made available by the CMS were identified. Brand and generic versions were identified in the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS, May 2006). Single exit <b>prices</b> <b>inclusive</b> of value added tax were obtained from the web site of the Pharmaceutical Blue Book and the cost per defined daily dose for one month was then calculated.

40|$|This report brings {{together}} three separate, short papers on problems of Brazilian trade and payments. The following topics are addressed: {{the determinants of}} export behavior in the manufactures sector, measures of the real exchange rate and the monetary approach applied to the external balance. In the paper on export behavior of manufactures, we report estimates of an export supply equation. We show that for the period 1959 - 1977 exports of manufactures were determined by productive capacity, the relative <b>price</b> (<b>inclusive</b> of subsidies) facing exporters and the domestic output gap. The equation describes well the behavior of exports and documents on export price elasticity of unity and a significant responsiveness of exports {{to the level of}} domestic demand relative to capacity. The study of real exchange rates examines a number of different empirical measures of external competitiveness. Specifically, we look at the manufactures terms of trade, the relative wholesale prices in Brazil and abroad, export prices relative to home prices and export prices relative to prices in world trade. The comparison of these real exchange rate measures points out the important role that composition effects played in Brazilian export growth. A large fraction of Brazilian exports is in the area of processed foods that experienced a particularly sharp increase in their relative price in world trade in 1968 - 1974. The paper dealing with the monetary approach explains reserve and exchange rate behavior in terms of domestic credit and the determinants of nominal money demand.

While the technical expertise exists, industrial processing of cowpeas remains largely nonexistent in West Africa with newly developed cowpea-based products such as cowpea flour confined to laboratories and rarely reaching the point of commercialization where they might alleviate poverty. ^ Thus, the major objective {{of this study was to}} identify the key factors necessary for the {{development of}} the cowpea flour industry. First, the economic importance of the cowpea-based street food sector in West Africa and implications for value-added processing of cowpeas were examined. The focus of this study was on a common cowpea-based product – 2 ̆ 2 kossaï. 2 ̆ 2 Next, a contract theory framework and experimental methods were employed to examine the business dynamics and informal contracting agreements between kossaï vendors and their key input suppliers - cowpea grinders. Additionally, the potential demand for cowpea flour by kossaï vendors was assessed using a non-hypothetical real purchase decision mechanism. ^ Three key results were found in this study. First, the cowpea street food sector is a vital component of the cowpea value chain and is important for poverty alleviation and economic development. In particular, kossai vending represents an important source of income for women with low levels of literacy that they spend on food, medicine, savings and school supplies to support their families. Additionally, significant quantities of locally-produced cowpea grains are used in the preparation of kossaï which create market linkages that promote domestic agricultural production. ^ Second, kossaï vendors face significant business challenges related to opportunistic behavior of their key input suppliers – grinders. Informal contracts characterized by varying degrees of contractual incompleteness and relational incentives were found to be important mechanisms used by the kossai vendors to address their business challenges. Providing evidence that supports the theory of 2 ̆ 2 strategic ambiguity, 2 ̆ 2 kossaï vendors were found to have a preference for highly incomplete contracts which allowed them to self-enforce contract agreements, though these were associated with weaker pre-contractual incentives. Relational incentives also helped kossaï vendors mitigate grinder opportunistic behavior and decrease ex-ante transaction costs as long-term kossaï vendors were able to successfully negotiate and implement highly incomplete contracts that motivate high-quality grinding service and were associated with relatively lower contract payments. ^ Third, a demand exists for cowpea flour by kossaï vendors, who are willing to pay a <b>price</b> <b>inclusive</b> of production costs and a 20...|$|R
