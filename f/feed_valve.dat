30|$|During {{the initial}} stages of online salt cleaning, a {{concentration}} of about 10  % was dosed for 1  min daily (while the SWRO unit was in operation) by opening and closing the <b>feed</b> <b>valve</b> (V# 1) and cleaning tank valve (V# 2) simultaneously as shown in Fig.  2. However, this mode of operation led to an increase in feed pressure. Hence, later on, the experiment was repeated with a new set of membranes where the feed pressure was maintained constant by controlling the brine valve (V# 3) as shown in Fig.  2. Towards the end of the trial, a higher concentration of salt (up to 24  %) was used with daily dosing for a period of 2  min. This experiment was also repeated with a new set of membranes as there was a sudden unexpected increase in permeate conductivity during the second trial.|$|E
40|$|Many {{continuous}} {{industrial processes}} {{can be controlled}} using programmable automation controllers for digital implementation of classical PID control. For this type of applications, a PID control block has been developed {{for use in the}} programming environment PCWorkx. In the lecture two types of PID control of tank level are discussed: single point control and cascade control. The single point control uses a single PID controller to regulate tank level using a single measurement for feedback being tank level itself. The PID controller output determines the state of the <b>feed</b> <b>valve.</b> The system has limitations in reacting to variations in output flow, which is to be regarded as a system disturbance. The cascade control uses two PID controllers for a better performance of the level control. The master controller is the level controller using the level setpoint and measurement to determine the setpoint for the slave controller driving the input flow valve. Measurements of input and output flow are taken into account, enabling the system to faster respond to ouput flow disturbances. Both types of control can be implemented using the PID control block in PCWorkx for programming a Phoenix Contact ILC. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Though lots of {{numerical}} {{methods have}} been proposed in the literature to optimize me-chanical structures at {{the final stage of}} the design process, few designers use these tools since the first stage. However, a minor modification at the first step can bring significant change to the global performances of the structure. Usually, during the initial stage, models are based on theoretical and empirical equations, which are often characterized by mixed variables: continuous (e. g. geometrical dimensions), discrete (e. g. the cross section of a beam available in a catalogue) and/or integer (e. g. the number of layers in a composite material). Furthermore, the functions involved may be non differentiable, or even discontinuous. Therefore, classical algorithms based on the computation of sensi-tivities are no more applicable. Consequently, to solve these problems, the most wide-spread meta-heuristic methods are evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which work as follows: the best individuals among an initial population of randomly generated potential solutions are favoured and com-bined (by specific operators like crossover and mutation) in order to create potentially better individuals at the next generation. The creation of new generations is repeated till the convergence is reached. The ability of EAs to explore widely the design space is useful to solve single-objective unconstrained optimization problems, because it gener-ally prevents from getting trapped into a local optimum, but it is also well known that they do not perform very efficiently in the presence of constraints. Furthermore, in many industrial applications, multiple objectives are pursued together. Therefore, {{to take into account the}} constrained and multicriteria aspects of optimization problems in EAs, a new method called PAMUC (Preferences Applied to MUltiobjectiv-ity and Constraints) has been proposed in this dissertation. First the user has to assign weights to the m objectives. Then, an additional objective function is built by linearly aggregating the normalized constraints. Finally, a multicriteria decision aid method, PROMETHEE II, is used in order to rank the individuals of the population following the m+ 1 objectives. PAMUC has been validated on standard multiobjective test cases, as well as on the pa-rametrical optimization of the purge valve and the <b>feed</b> <b>valve</b> of the Vinci engine, both designed by Techspace Aero for launcher Ariane 5. en sciences appliquéesinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} prediction of the unsteady flow field developing in a regulation valve for space thrusters. The flow field displays an unsteady behavior characterized by complex flow patterns, because such valves have a very narrow throat {{and because of the}} presence of geometrical slope discontinuities downstream the throat for design constraints. The narrowness of the throat induces strong flow accelerations and therefore strong temperature and pressure reductions. The geometrical discontinuities cause the occurrence of local flow separations and shock waves, with an high degree of unsteadiness. Experiments have pointed out how the degree of unsteadiness strongly depends upon the nature of the gas <b>feeding</b> the <b>valve.</b> The strongest unsteadiness has been observed in the case of xenon at low exit pressures. Numerical simulations, using a compressible Navier-Stokes flow solver, have been performed under different working conditions and for two different gases, nitrogen and xenon. The results agree with experiments, and provide details of the unsteadiness mechanism and of its evolution depending upon the operating conditions...|$|R
