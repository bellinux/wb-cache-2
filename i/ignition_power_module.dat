This study mainly aims to explore the controlling factors affecting the smolder initiation time of polyurethane foams under natural convection.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the first <b>power</b> <b>module</b> by Semikron in 1975, many innovations have been made to improve the thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance of <b>power</b> <b>modules.</b> These innovations in packaging technology focus on the enhancement of the heat dissipation and thermal cycling capability of the modules. Thermal cycles, caused by varying load and environmental operating conditions, induce high mechanical stress in the interconnection layers of the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), leading to fatigue and growth of microcracks in the bonding materials. As a result, the lifetime of <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> can be severely limited in practical applications. Furthermore, to reduce the size and weight of converters, the semiconductors are being operated at higher junction temperatures. Higher temperatures are especially of great interest for use of wide-?bandgap materials, such as SiC and GaN, because these materials leverage their material characteristics, particularly at higher temperatures. To satisfy these tightened requirements, on the one hand, conventional <b>power</b> <b>modules,</b> i. e., direct bonded Cu (DBC) -based systems with bond wire contacts, have been further improved. On the other hand, alternative packaging techniques, e. g., chip embedding into printed circuit boards (PCBs) and <b>power</b> <b>module</b> packaging based on the selective laser melting (SLM) technique, have been developed, which might constitute an alternative to conventional <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> in certain applications...|$|R

40|$|The design {{feasibility}} study is documented {{of a single}} cylinder, free piston Stirling engine/linear alternator (FPSE/LA) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> generating 150 kW-electric (kW sub e), and {{the determination of the}} <b>module's</b> maximum feasible <b>power</b> level. The <b>power</b> <b>module</b> configuration was specified to be a single cylinder (single piston, single displacer) FPSE/LA, with tuning capacitors if required. The design requirements were as follows: (1) Maximum electrical power output; (2) <b>Power</b> <b>module</b> thermal efficiency equal to or greater than 20 percent at a specific mass of 5 to 8 kg/kW(sub e); (3) Heater wall temperature/cooler wall temperature = 1050 K/ 525 K; (4) Sodium heat-pipe heat transport system, pumped loop NaK (sodium-potassium eutectic mixture) rejection system; (5) Maximum <b>power</b> <b>module</b> vibration amplitude = 0. 0038 cm; and (6) Design life = 7 years (60, 000 hr). The results show that a single cylinder FPSE/LA is capable of meeting program goals and has attractive scaling attributes over the power range from 25 to 150 kW(sub e). Scaling beyond the 150 kW(sub e) power level, the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> efficiency falls and the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> specific mass reaches 10 kg/kW(sub e) at a power output of 500 kW(sub e). A discussion of scaling rules for the engine, alternator, and heat transport systems is presented, along with {{a detailed description of the}} conceptual design of a 150 kW(sub e) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> that meets the requirements. Included is a discussion of the design of a dynamic balance system. A parametric study of <b>power</b> <b>module</b> performance conducted over the power output range of 25 to 150 kW(sub e) for temperature ratios of 1. 7, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 is presented and discussed. The results show that as the temperature ratio decreases, the efficiency falls and specific mass increases. At a temperature ratio of 1. 7, the 150 kW(sub e) <b>power</b> <b>module</b> cannot satisfy both efficiency and specific mass goals. As the power level increases from 25 to 150 kW(sub e) at a fixed temperature ratio, <b>power</b> <b>module</b> efficiency is seen to increase slightly, but at the expense of increased specific mass. An empirical equation relating <b>power</b> <b>module</b> thermal efficiency as a function of <b>power</b> <b>module</b> specific mass, <b>power</b> output, and temperature ratio is developed. Alternative configurations to the single cylinder, direct coupled linear alternator approach are also evaluated, but are shown to have technical drawbacks that lessen their attractiveness. The dynamic balance assembly mass (moving mass and structure) represents 20 to 30 percent of the total single cylinder <b>power</b> <b>module</b> mass. Joining two modules in a balanced opposed configuration eliminates the need for the balancer, and a hot end junction can be made without significant addition of structural mass.

40|$|The {{in-service}} {{reliability of}} <b>power</b> electronics <b>modules</b> during their normal operation {{in their work}} environment {{is a major concern}} for application developers. Failure mechanisms act on <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> limiting their lifetime and leading to unpredictable interruptions of power converter operation. That reduces the availability of power converters and can have large financial and safety implications in applications such as in wind turbines and railway traction. Therefore, many attempts are made to use Physics-of-Failure models to estimate the lifetime of <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> while in service utilizing the rainflow counting algorithm. However, large uncertainty in the lifetime estimate given by Physics-of-Failure methods limits the usefulness of that estimate and cannot help improving the availability of power converters. Condition Monitoring on the other hand provides information about the current health state of <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> based on online measurements of failure indicators that can be obtained from the <b>power</b> <b>modules.</b> This information can be used to inform the prognostics stage to provide an estimate of lifetime based on PoF models and online measurements in a Fusion-based approach such that uncertainty in the resulting lifetime estimate can be reduced. In this thesis, the main emphasis is to use online measurement data of failure indicators that can be obtained during the normal operation of <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> to infer the health status of the <b>power</b> <b>module.</b> Failure indicators such as the on-state voltage and junction temperature are estimated or measured online from the power converter. They are indicative of the two dominant failure mechanisms of <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> which are wire-bond lift-off and solder fatigue. Therefore, different simultaneous failure mechanisms can be discriminated. However, in order to infer the health information from the online measurement and discriminate between failure mechanisms, the measurement noise and the effects of operating conditions should be removed from the measurement. The approach proposed in this thesis is based on combining online measurements with pre-determined models of the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> in its original state. Comparing the online measurements with the models reveals the deviation of the <b>power</b> <b>module</b> from its original state. To achieve this, Kalman filter is used to estimate junction temperature based on a noisy estimate from a thermo-sensitive electrical parameter. In addition, measurement circuits are developed to realize the online measurements during normal operation of <b>power</b> <b>modules.</b> The health information inferred from the online measurement of failure indicators can be used in the future to estimate the remaining useful lifetime of the <b>power</b> <b>modules</b> and to inform the Physics-of-Failure models in a fusion framework {{in order to reduce the}} uncertainty in the lifetime estimates...|$|R
