2500|$|In 1889 {{the chiefs}} and rulers of Niue, {{in a letter}} to Queen Victoria, asked her [...] "to stretch out towards us your mighty hand, that Niue may hide herself in it and be safe". After expressing anxiety lest some other nation should take {{possession}} of the island, the letter continued: [...] "We leave it with you to do as seems best to you. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>send</b> the flag of Britain that is well; or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>send</b> a Commissioner to reside among us, that will be well". The British did not initially take up the offer. In 1900 a petition by the Cook Islanders asking for annexation included Niue [...] "if possible". In a document dated 19 October 1901, the [...] "King" [...] and Chiefs of Niue consented to [...] "Queen Victoria taking possession of this island". A despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies from the Governor of New Zealand referred to the views expressed by the Chiefs in favour of [...] "annexation" [...] and to this document as [...] "the deed of cession". A British Protectorate was declared, but it remained short-lived. Niue was brought within the boundaries of New Zealand on 11 June 1901 by the same Order and Proclamation as the Cook Islands. The Order limited the islands to which it related by reference to an area in the Pacific described by co-ordinates, and Niue, at 19.02 S., 169.55 W, lies within that area.|$|E
2500|$|In 214, {{after the}} warlord Liu Bei {{took control of}} Yi Province, he {{appointed}} Zhou Qun as acting Colonel of the Scholars (儒林校尉) in his administration. Around 217, when Liu Bei was planning to launch a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from his rival Cao Cao, he consulted Zhou Qun {{and asked him to}} predict the outcome. Zhou Qun said, [...] "You will get the territory but you won't have its people. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>send</b> a detachment of your main army to attack (instead of sending your main army), you will lose the battle. You should be very careful about this!" [...] At the time, Zhang Yu, another diviner serving under Liu Bei, also said, [...] "If you attack Hanzhong, your army will suffer a defeat." [...] Liu Bei ignored their advice and proceeded with the campaign. Just as Zhou Qun predicted, Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and captured the territories but not its people because they had already migrated elsewhere. During the campaign, Liu Bei also ordered Wu Lan (吳蘭) and Lei Tong (雷銅) to lead a detachment of troops from his main army to attack Wudu Commandery (武都郡; around present-day Longnan, Gansu), but, as Zhou Qun warned him, this detachment ended up being completely destroyed by Cao Cao's forces.|$|E
