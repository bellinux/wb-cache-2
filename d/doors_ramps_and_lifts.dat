40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{experimental}} characterization of the vortices structure in the aft fuselage region and {{in the wake of}} a simplified geometry of a military transport aircraft. It comes within the framework of the military problematics of airflow influence on airdrop operations. This analysis relies on high-accuracy three-components PIV measurements. An original tool, dedicated to vortex identification and characterization, was developed and successfully applied to the PIV databases obtained for two airdrop configurations: closed cargo- <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>ramp,</b> <b>and</b> opened cargo-door <b>and</b> <b>ramp.</b> A complex vortices dynamics is revealed and precisely described, in terms of vortices positions, intensities, sizes, shapes and turbulence levels...|$|R

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by General Aircraft as the GAL.60 Universal Freighter, the first {{aircraft}} was dismantled at the Feltham, Middlesex factory and transported to Brough in Yorkshire {{to have its}} maiden flight on 20 June 1950. This {{was followed by a}} second, the GAL.65, which was modified from the original. Clamshell doors replaced a combination of a <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>ramp,</b> <b>and</b> the tailplane boom received seating for 36 passengers. The Bristol Hercules engines became Bristol Centaurus with reverse-pitch propellers, a feature that gave it a short landing length and the ability to reverse under its own power. The takeoff run at full load was given as 790 yards, the landing run at full load, 310 yards.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Belfast was {{a relatively}} conservatively-stressed cylinder of a conventional design. It was developed with a target safe-life of 15,000 pressure cycles, which was fatigued tested using a complete fuselage emerged in a water tank. Fail-safe principles {{were used in the}} design of the large side <b>door,</b> rear <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> <b>door.</b> Rolled Z-sections were used throughout the majority of the fuselage frames and stringers, while box beams are used where the exertion of heavier-than-average loads had been typically anticipated; the structure lacks any use of forgings or machined members.|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} hours of 30 April, {{a group of}} four Provisional IRA members held a family hostage in Killeen and stole a {{mechanical}} excavator. This was {{to be used to}} build a makeshift ramp up to the Dublin-Belfast railway line, which drew parallel to the Dublin-Belfast motorway (M1).At the same time, other IRA members stole a Renault Master van in Dundalk, which was then loaded with 2200 lb of home-made explosives. The van was fitted with wheels that could run on the rails. The excavator moved up the <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> <b>lifted</b> the van onto the railway. The van was then driven some 800 metres north and a mile-long wire attached to a triggering device was added to the bomb. Meanwhile, IRA members in support set up roadblocks {{on both sides of the}} border to keep people away. The IRA unit who set up the checkpoint in the Republic wore Garda Síochána uniforms.|$|R
