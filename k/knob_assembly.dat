40|$|Cell surface {{structures}} termed knobs {{are one of}} {{the most}} important pathogenesis related protein complexes deployed by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum at the surface of the infected erythrocyte. Despite their relevance to the disease, their structure, mechanisms of traffic and their process of assembly remain poorly understood. In this study, we have explored the possible role of a parasite-encoded Hsp 40 class of chaperone, namely PFB 0090 c/PF 3 D 7 _ 0201800 (KAHsp 40) in protein trafficking in the infected erythrocyte. We found the gene coding for PF 3 D 7 _ 0201800 to be located in a chromosomal cluster together with knob components KAHRP and PfEMP 3. Like the knob components, KAHsp 40 too showed the presence of PEXEL motif required for transport to the erythrocyte compartment. Indeed, sub-cellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) showed KAHsp 40 to be exported in the erythrocyte cytoplasm in a stage dependent manner localizing as punctuate spots in the erythrocyte periphery, distinctly from Maurerâ€™s cleft, in structures which could be the reminiscent of knobs. Double IFA analysis revealed co-localization of PF 3 D 7 _ 0201800 with the markers of knobs (KAHRP, PfEMP 1 and PfEMP 3) and components of the PEXEL translocon (Hsp 101, PTEX 150). KAHsp 40 was also found to be in a complex with KAHRP, PfEMP 3 and Hsp 101 as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay.
