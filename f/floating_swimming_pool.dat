It flows through the city centre of Berlin to join the River Havel in Spandau, one of Berlin’s western boroughs, which itself {{ultimately}} merges with the Elbe to enter the sea in Cuxhaven, after flowing through Hamburg. On its route through Berlin, the river passes Berlin Cathedral (Berliner Dom), the Reichstag and the Schloss Charlottenburg.

50|$|The first quay {{along the}} Seine, the Quai des Grand-Augustins, was {{built at the}} {{beginning}} of the 16th century. By the early 19th century the riverbanks were fully paved and developed; the site of the modern park was occupied by a depot for building stones, docks, and some waterfront cafes. In the early 20th century it was the home of a <b>floating</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool.</b> Between 1961 and 1967, a highway was built along the river to reduce traffic in the center of the city. In 1991 the banks of the Seine were declared a UNESCO cultural site, and efforts began to turn the waterfront into a park. Beginning in 2001, the highway was closed to traffic on Sundays and used by runners and promenaders. In 2008, under Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, a project was approved to turn the section of the highway from the Musee D'Orsay to the Pont de l'Alma into a permanent public promenade.|$|E

5000|$|In the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, the paved quay of the Left Bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay {{had been used}} for several {{international}} expositions, for boat docks and storage depots, and for cafes and <b>floating</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool.</b> Between 1961 and 1967, highways were built along both banks of the river to relieve traffic congestion {{in the center of}} the city. In 1991, the banks of the river were classified as UNESCO cultural heritage site, and efforts began to turn the highways into parks and promenades. Beginning in 2008, a 2.3 kilometer section of the highway was permanently closed and made into the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which was dedicated on June 19, 2013. The promenade includes five floating [...] "islands", a total of 1800 square meters in size, placed atop barges, with trees, bushes, flowers and deck chairs. The former highway is lined with spaces for concerts and classes; outdoor exhibit space; playgrounds; a climbing wall; a discothèque under a bridge; and tipis and furnished containers which can be hired for lunches, celebrations or meetings. There are boat docks and several outdoor cafes along the promenade. All the facilities of the park are portable, and can be removed within 24 hours if the waters of the Seine rise too high. The promenade was designed by architect Franklin Azzi, and the islands were created by Jean-Christophe Chobet.|$|E

5000|$|Holmes' {{contribution}} to the 1988 documentary {{is perhaps the most}} memorable, as he was interviewed while <b>floating</b> in a <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> fully clothed and visibly quite intoxicated while his mother sat poolside. The interview stood out {{in stark contrast to the}} more light-hearted and humorous interviews conducted by director Penelope Spheeris, which mostly portrayed rockers as good-natured, though often dimwitted or deluded, party animals. During the interview, Holmes smiled drunkenly at the camera, deeming himself [...] "a full-blown alcoholic" [...] and [...] "a piece of crap" [...] despite his band's success, and punctuated his remarks by guzzling from three bottles of vodka. At the end of the interview, Holmes upends a full bottle of Smirnoff over his head as he rolls out of his inflatable chair and into the water.|$|R

Michael Weldon, in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, noted, [...] "If you like really sick films, see this one...The ads {{made it look like}} another baby-sitter-in-distress movie, but it's in a class by itself." [...] Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror described the film as [...] "yet another woman-in-jeopardy movie...the covert suggestion that the female victims have 'asked for it' is particularly objectionable." [...] However, the review further observed that Nicholas Worth's performance as the lunatic killer was [...] "so outrageously over-the-top, and so bizarrely eccentric as to be horribly fascinating and the final line of 'Adios, creep', delivered over a shot of Worth's corpse <b>floating</b> in a <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> is curiously resonant."Leonard Maltin gave the film a BOMB rating, stating that it was another psychopathic Vietnam veteran killer film, warning readers to not watch the film.|$|R

Furthermore, the thesis should show the threats and opportunities of the selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools.</b> Methods: The case analysis was chosen as the main research method.

Through this method the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> are shown.
