5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
25|$|Beckham was {{the first}} England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off. Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.|$|E
60|$|Dropping his rifle, {{he seized}} the boys {{by the neck}} and thrust their <b>faces</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moss: not a moment too soon, for a {{withering}} volley was instantly sent by the bandits in the direction whence the shots had come. It passed harmlessly over their heads.|$|R

25|$|All tiles {{are placed}} <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and are shuffled. By {{convention}} all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces {{around the table}} rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down {{as soon as possible}} to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place {{his hands behind his}} back, and handcuffed him, leaving him <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E
25|$|After an evenly matched 3 rounds, the 4th round started more in Maccarinelli's favour. Halfway {{through the}} round, Maccarinelli dropped Jones with an uppercut. Jones beat the count and carried on for 10–12 seconds more with his gloves to his face, eating several more uppercuts. Against the ropes, he then absorbed a huge right hook which {{caused him to}} stiffen and fall <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canvas. Referee Ingo Barrabas waved off the fight in what was Jones' 9th career defeat, the 5th by KO.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of a year, special “season” event cards are {{randomly}} chosen from a deck. All players learn the modifiers these cards may have on the game. These four cards are then shuffled and placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> season track. The first three seasons, a card is revealed and its modifiers applied to the game. During the last season (Winter), the modifiers are ignored, but a number on the card reveals the extent of grain shortage for that year. This element allows players a certain level of planning, but an uncertainty of when (or even if) the season event will happen.|$|E
25|$|Once at the site, the Jews were {{housed in}} the barn and taken in groups of 20 of a time to a point 40 or 50 meters from the trench, where they were ordered to lie <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Groups of ten were then ordered to stand up, and, except for children, remove their outer clothing. As they were {{moved closer to the}} pit, they were ordered to strip completely. A Latvian guard, Bulvāns, later testified that he saw two Germans, SS-Scharführer ("squad leader") Karl-Emil Strott and Philip (or Filip) Krapp, using a whip on people who did not move on to the pit.|$|E
25|$|At first {{erected in}} the little village centre before the town hall, it was quickly dynamited off its {{pedestal}} by the priest, then successively kept in pieces behind a hair salon, repaired by welding, and at last moved several kilometres {{to the place where}} it still stands. There, it was once again torn off its pedestal by a tropical cyclone, then abandoned, <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, for twenty years before finally being found by chance during construction work in 1968. It was then put back in place, rehabilitated as a memorial to World War I dead, celebrated in magnificent public ceremonies, registered in the general inventory of historic monuments, and finally classified as such in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Itatiella ulei is {{dark green}} to brown 10-25mm long plant. Just like other moss, this plant divides into two parts, which are {{sporophyte}} and gametophyte. The stems are brown, straight and forming tufs. The rhizome is pale-brown and <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Leaves are 2.5-4.0mm long with {{the shape of}} oblong-lanceolate. This plant has hexagonal-quadratic cells that are thick walled. This plant is dioicous which means gametophytes produce sperm or eggs but never both. The perichaetium that surrounds the archegonia and {{the base of the}} seta is terminal and their leaves are long. The perigonium that surrounds the antheridia is also terminal and their leaves are short and broad. Its small size and the inflexed leaf apex characterize Itatiella ulei. This species is growing directly exposed to sun at high elevations present a similar aspect but can be distinguished based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distal lamella cells which are single and rhombic.|$|R

50|$|The first dealer {{is chosen}} by a draw for high card, and {{thereafter}} the turn to deal proceeds counter clockwise. The entire deck is dealt two cards at a time, <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> beginning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dealer's right (The first deal being either one card or three cards per player, {{in order to}} arrive at thirteen cards each). The players then pick up their cards and arrange them by suits.|$|R
25|$|After {{driving to}} midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz {{for the next}} play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked {{the ball out of}} Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed to get one step ahead of Simpson, make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by {{recording}} his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E
500|$|The second team, officer Herb Frauenberger and his partner, Tony Palma, {{arrived a}} few minutes later. They found Lennon lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the {{reception}} area, blood pouring from his mouth, and his clothing already soaked with blood, with Hastings attending to him. Realizing the extent of Lennon's injuries, the policemen decided not to wait for an ambulance, immediately carried him into their squad car, and rushed him to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Officer James Moran said they placed Lennon in the back seat.|$|E
500|$|Moscone {{planned to}} {{announce}} White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty {{to inform you that}} both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White." [...] Milk was 48years old. Moscone was 49.|$|E
50|$|As a suggestion, {{the player}} should do {{whichever}} one does {{the most to}} help in cleaning up a column later. It also helps {{to take into account}} the fact that the player should not touch a completed column of thirteen cards.. It is also good to focus <b>on</b> releasing <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leftmost columns to aid in splitting them and reaching the face-down cards, especially the first three columns.|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} {{is for a}} deck of cards to be shuffled and placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> game playing area. When a random result is called for, a player draws a card and what is printed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> card determines the outcome of the result.|$|R

Cassmer struck Struble <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the neck, which rendered Struble unconscious for several minutes and resulted in injuries requiring {{the attention of a}} physician.|$|R
5000|$|If the two cards played are {{of equal}} value, {{then there is}} a [...] "war". Both players place the next card of their pile <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> {{depending}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> variant, and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all four (or six) cards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.|$|R

If there is a set, they pile it up on top of each other, usually leaving space <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> top part of the cards.|$|R
