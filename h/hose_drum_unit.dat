500|$|After {{the end of}} the Falklands War in 1982, the Vulcan B.2 was due to be {{withdrawn}} from RAF service that year.

50|$|In 1977, studies began into {{converting}} redundant commercial VC10s into aerial refuelling tankers; the RAF subsequently {{issued a}} contract to British Aerospace to convert five former BOAC VC10s and four former East African Airways Super VC10s, designated VC10 K2 and VC10 K3 respectively. During conversion, extra fuel tanks were installed in the former passenger cabin; these increased the theoretical maximum fuel load to 85 tons/77 tonnes (K2) and 90 tons/82 tonnes (K3), the Super VC10's fin fuel tank making the difference. In practice, the fuel load was capped by the maximum take-off weight before the tanks were full. Both variants featured a pair of wing-mounted refuelling pods and a single centreline refuelling point, known as a <b>Hose</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>Unit</b> (HDU), installed in the rear freight bay; nose-mounted refuelling probes were also fitted.|$|E

5000|$|A {{total of}} 108 Valiants would be manufactured, {{including}} the sole B.2 prototype. In {{addition to their}} principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's nuclear deterrent, the Valiant was capable of performing, or was otherwise adapted to perform, in other capacities; these included conventional bombing, aerial reconnaissance, aerial refuelling tanker, and electronic countermeasures. [...] Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through {{the addition of a}} <b>Hose</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>Unit</b> (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs. This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay). Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the Blue Steel nuclear-armed standoff missile, which was later added to the arsenal of munitions equipped upon the other V-Bombers.|$|E
