40|$|Abstract. Cystic meningioma is an {{uncommon}} menin-gioma variant {{that is often}} difficult to distinguish from other <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors,</b> including necrotic gliomas. Cystic meningiomas located in the ventricle are particularly rare and may be misdiagnosed with other brain tumors, including ependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma and neurocytoma, due to its location. The present study discusses two cases of lateral ventricular meningiomas, which exhibited intratumoral or peritumoral cystic changes on magnetic resonance imaging scans. The two patients underwent surgical treatment and histological examination confirmed one case of metaplastic meningioma and the other case of psammomatous menin-gioma. The two patients were middle-aged females and had been misdiagnosed prior to surgery. Although this clinical entity is rare, the diagnosis of meningioma should be consid-ered, particularly in middle-aged female patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{presentation}} of cystic meningioma in the inter-hemispheric near the falx cerebri is uncommon. It {{is difficult to}} differentiate it from <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors,</b> such as gliomas. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} it is misdiagnosed as other types of brain tumors. Methods: In this study, we reported a cystic meningioma case in the inter-hemispheric location, showing an intramural nodule on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: Patient underwent surgical treatment and pathological section confirmation revealing meningioma. The patient was a middle-age woman and had been misdiagnosed as suffering from glioma followed by slight hemipharesis on the right extremities. Conclusions: Although this is a rare case, it will be good if we always consider cystic meningioma in inter-hemispheric space when diagnosing this type of cystic lesion if the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a cystic lesion mimicking glioma image presentation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Priority {{objectives}} of surgical neurooncology (diagnosis verification, tumor cytoreduction, {{and preservation of}} patient’s functional status) can be achieved both through traditional neurosurgical approaches and {{through the use of}} keyhole surgery. Keyhole surgery allows to minimize unnecessary, extended resection of the skull base and long-term static brain tissue retraction. Objective. The authors present preliminary results of the use of supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in intra- and extra-axial brain tumors.   Materials and methods. In 2014 – 2016, 45 patients were operated through supraorbital craniotomy to treat intra- and extra-axial tumors. The majority of patients (n = 28) was diagnosed with anterior cranial fossa meningiomas. Gliomas of the frontal lobe were diagnosed in 12 patients. The average tumor size ranged from 3 to 3. 5 cm. Results. Mortality, disability, or serious permanent access-related complications were not observed in our group. In all cases, the transition to the classical craniotomy was not required. Periorbital edema and transient hypoesthesia were observed in all patients. Permanent frontal hypoesthesia was observed in 3 patients (4 %) for a time period up to six months. According to postoperative MRI performed in all patients at the time of discharge, in the group of <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumor</b> gross-total removal was observed in 8 patients (47 %), in 9 patients (53 %) the tumor was near-totally removed (more than 90 % of the tumor), in the group of meningiomas all 28 patients had gross-total removal. Conclusion. Supraorbital craniotomy can be an effective and safe alternative to classic approaches to treatment of extra-axial tumors of the anterior cranial fossa and <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> of the frontal lobe. The approach requires a very careful selection of patients, individualization of surgery, and further critical evaluation.  </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gadobenate dimeglumine {{has proved}} {{advantageous}} {{compared with other}} gadolinium-based contrast agents for contrast-enhanced brain MR imaging. Gadobutrol is a more highly concentrated agent (1. 0 mol/L). This study intraindividually compared 0. 1 -mmol/kg doses of these agents for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with suspected or known brain tumors underwent 2 identical MR imaging examinations at 1. 5 T, 1 with gadobenate dimeglumine {{and the other with}} gadobutrol, both at a dose of 0. 1 -mmol/kg body weight. The agents were injected in randomized order separated by 3 – 14 days. Imaging sequences and acquisition timing were identical for the 2 examina-tions.

40|$|A 69 -year-old male was {{admitted}} to our hospital upon inci-dental finding of calcification in the left temporal lobe during a computed tomography scan (Fig. 1 A). Magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) revealed a 2. 4 × 3. 0 × 2. 5 cm mass located deeply in the left Sylvian fissure extending into the left temporal lobe. On both T 2 and T 1 -weighted images, it was mainly iso- or hypoin-tense, and enhanced brightly with contrast (Fig. 1 B, C). The le-sion appeared {{closely associated with the}} MCA and was sur-rounded by moderate edema.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{surgical}} {{management of}} deep intra-axial lesions still requires microsurgical approaches that utilize retraction of deep white matter to obtain adequate visualization. We report our {{experience with a}} new tubular retractor system, designed specifically for intracranial applications, linked with frameless neuronavigation for a cohort of intraventricular and deep <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors.</b> METHODS: The ViewSite Brain Access System (Vycor, Inc) was used {{in a series of}} 9 adult and pediatric patients with a variety of pathologies. Histological diagnoses either resected or biopsied with the system included: colloid cyst, DNET, papillary pineal tumor, anaplastic astrocytoma, toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. The locations of the lesions approached include: lateral ventricle, basal ganglia, pulvinar/posterior thalamus and insular cortex. Post-operative imaging was assessed to determine extent of resection and extent of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory (based on T (2) /FLAIR and diffusion restriction/ADC signal). RESULTS: Satisfactory resection or biopsy was obtained in all patients. Radiographic analysis demonstrated evidence of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory in one patient. None of the patients experienced neurological deficits as a result of white matter retraction/manipulation. CONCLUSION: Based on a retrospective review of our experience, we feel that this access system, when used in conjunction with frameless neuronavigational systems, provides adequate visualization for tumor resection while permitting the use of standard microsurgical techniques through minimally invasive craniotomies. Our initial data indicate that this system may minimize white matter injury, but further studies are necessary...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGliosarcomas are bimorphic <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors.</b> They rarely involve {{both the}} skull base and ventricles simultaneously. A case of {{temporal}} lobe gliosarcoma with significant infratemporal fossa and lateral ventricle extension is reported. The patient, an 82 -year-old man, had gradual general weakness and a poor response to speech for 3 weeks. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for poor awareness and myoclonic jerks. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 72 -cm 3 right temporal mass with extension into the infratemporal fossa {{and the wall}} of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, and consisted of intra-axial and extracranial components with extension to the cavernous sinus, dura, temporal bone, and sphenoid ridge. The patient underwent a right-sided craniotomy through the orbitozygomatic approach. Gross total resection was achieved. The histopathological diagnosis was gliosarcoma. Fractional whole-brain radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide were administered subsequently. However, the tumor recurred 1. 5 months after his initial treatment, and the survival time was 9. 2 months. In the case of a mass lesion with both intra-axial and extracranial involvement, the simultaneous involvement of both the skull base and ventricles is highly unexpected, and gliosarcoma {{should be included in the}} differential diagnoses of brain tumors. The overall treatment and outcome will be difficult to determine if the skull base and ventricles are both involved. An extensive multimodality treatment might be effective in patients with gliosarcomas according to a review of the literature. The recurrence-free time of gliosarcoma with skull base extension ranges from 2 months to 12 months, and for gliosarcoma with ventricular extension, it ranges from 1. 5 months to 2 months. The survival time of gliosarcoma with skull base extension ranges from 7 months to 22 months, and with ventricular extension, it ranges from 0. 33 months to 9. 2 months. Gliosarcoma with ventricular involvement might be a poor prognostic factor, and may help in the prediction of recurrence-free and survival time...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with brain-stem hematoma were {{admitted to the}} authors' institute {{during the period from}} 1985 to 1988. Clinical symptoms and signs pointed to pontine involvement in most cases. Progressive clinical deterioration was quite common and usually led to a clinical diagnosis of brain-stem <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumor.</b> Angiography was noncontributory; computerized tomography (CT) was the main diagnostic test. This gave evidence of different pathological characteristics, including masses showing highly increased density, nonhomogeneous hyperdense lesions, and isodense lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. No clear correlation was found, however, between the presumed duration of the clinical picture and the CT characteristics of the lesion. In the last four cases, magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 0. 015 -tesla resistive system. This examination usually confirmed the presence of a brain-stem mass already shown by previous CT scans. There were, however, no cases in which direct evidence of an intra-axial vascular malformation could be obtained. The patients were all treated surgically with an attempt at total removal of the lesion and thorough inspection of the hematoma cavity and biopsy. Evidence of 'cryptic' arteriovenous malformation was obtained in six of the nine cases. There were minor transitory complications in three cases. All of the patients were able to resume their previous activity, and none suffered recurrence of the symptoms following the operation.

40|$|Abstract Background Giant cell {{ependymoma}} of the filum terminale {{is a rare}} variant, generally manifested as a well-circunscribed intradural {{mass with}} an indolent biological behavior. Case presentation We describe {{the case of a}} 48 -year-old Mexican female who non-relevant past medical history, that developed a GCE of the filum terminale. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed the presence of an <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumor</b> extending from L 3 to L 5 with extra-medullary invasion. Therefore the tumor was considered unresectable and only incisional biopsy was obtained, establishing the tentative diagnosis of a poorly differentiated neoplasia. A second evaluation of the case revealed the presence of numerous non-cohesive pleomorphic giant cells with intranuclear inclusions and broad eosinophilic cytoplasm, alternating with intermediate size cells with round, hyperchromatic nuclei and forming a perivascular pseudo-rosettes pattern. The ependymal phenotype was supported by light microscopy and corroborated by immunohistochemistry analysis. The patient was subsequently treated with radiotherapy 54 Gy. She is alive after a 27 -month follow-up, with residual disease, difficulty ambulating and pain. Conclusions GCE of filum terminale may have an atypical clinical and radiological presentation, albeit with invasive characteristics and anaplasia on histologic analysis. However, its biological behavior is indolent and associated to longer survival. Due to the presence of giant cells, the differential diagnosis of other primary neoplasias at that site were considered, including paraganglioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors as well as metastatic malignant melanoma, adrenal carcinoma, thyroid gland carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma, that may all harbor giant cells...|$|E

40|$|High-grade gliomas {{account for}} the {{majority}} of <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumors.</b> Despite abundant therapeutic efforts, clinical outcome is still poor. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are intensely being investigated. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER 1 /EGFR) is found in various epithelial tumors and represents {{one of the most common}} molecular abnormalities seen in high-grade gliomas. Dysregulated HER 1 /EGFR is found in 40 % to 50 % of glioblastoma, the most malignant subtype of glioma. Several agents such as tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, antibodies, radio-immuno conjugates, ligand-toxin conjugates, or RNA-based agents have been developed to target HER 1 /EGFR or its mutant form, EGFRvIII. To date, most agents are in various stages of clinical development. Clinical data are sparse but most advanced for TK inhibitors. Although data from experimental studies seem promising, proof of a significant clinical benefit is still missing. Among the problems that have to be further addressed is the prediction of the individual patient's response to HER 1 /EGFR-targeted therapeutics based on molecular determinants. It is quite possible that blocking HER 1 /EGFR alone will not sufficiently translate into a clinical benefit. Therefore, a multiple target approach concomitantly aimed at different molecular sites might be a favorable concept.

Perioperative morbidity not only has implications on direct patient care, but also serves {{as an indicator of}} the quality of care provided, and enables objective documentation, for comparision in various clinical trials. We document our experience at a tertiary care referral, a dedicated neuro-oncology center in India. Materials and Methods: One hundred and ninety-six patients undergoing various surgeries for <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumors</b> were analyzed. Routine microsurgical techniques and uniform antibiotic policy were used. Navigation/ intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring was not available. The endpoints assessed included immediate postoperative neurological status, neurological outcome at discharge, regional complications, systemic complications, overall morbidity, and mortality. Various risk factors assessed included clinico-epidemiological factors, tumor-related factors, and surgery-related factors. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: Median age was 38 years. 72 % had tumors larger than 4 cm. Neurological morbidity, and regional and systemic complications occurred in 16. 8, 17. 3, and 10. 7 %, respectively. Overall, major morbidity occurred in 18 % and perioperative mortality rate was 3. 6 %. Although a few of the known risk factors were found to be significant on univariate analysis, none achieved significance on multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Our patients were younger and had larger tumors than are generally reported. Despite the unavailability of advanced intraoperative aids we could achieve acceptable levels of morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that cyst formation accompanying astrocytomas in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is due to an edematous process caused by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and not a result of necrosis. This study is performed to investigate whether the hypothesis of cyst formation based on BBB disruption also applies to various pathologically different <b>intra-axial</b> gliomatous <b>tumors</b> and metastases. By chemical analysis, using immunokinetic nephelometry, isoelectric focussing, cellulose acetate electrophoresis and a biuretic method, the concentrations of albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, alpha(2) -macroglobulin, IgM and total protein were measured and proportions of concentrations of these proteins were compared in cyst fluid, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our data, based on the chemical analysis of cyst fluid and blood plasma of 37 patients, including 2 ependymomas tone cerebral; one thoracic), 3 oligodendrogliomas, 3 hemangioblastomas, 5 cerebellair astrocytomas and 1 cervical, 1 giant astrocytoma grade one, 1 gangliocytoma, 1 neuroblastoma and 19 metastases (five lung-; two renal-; three breast-; one melanoma-; one thyroid metastasis and seven metastases of unknown origin) present high protein concentrations in the cysts with a highly similar spectrum of proteins in the tumor cyst fluid and blood plasma, suggesting a BBB disruption followed by exudation of plasma proteins into the brain parenchyma with formation of edema and transition of edematous tissue into a cyst accompanying the tumor. Although histopathologically different types of tumor tissue are involved, data suggests that the pathogenesis of cysts accompanying gliomatous tumors and metastases in the CNS is based on BBB disruption and consequent edema, {{as is the case in}} the formation of cysts in anaplastic astrocytomas...|$|R
40|$|Background: Navigable {{ultrasound}} (NUS) is {{a useful}} adjunct for controlling resection in <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumors.</b> We investigated its role in predicting residual disease and thereby in influencing the intraoperative decision regarding additional resection as also its influence on survival in glioblastoma patients. Methods: A prospectively maintained database was accessed to retrieve the data regarding consecutive histologically verified gliomas operated using the NUS. We documented {{the number of times}} US images were obtained, the surgeon's impression of each scan and the subsequent decision regarding further resection. Survival (progression-free and overall) was calculated for patients with a glioblastoma, and univariate and multivariate analyses performed. Results: The NUS was used for resection control in 88 gliomas. In 66 cases, intermediate scans were performed resulting in further resection in 60 of them. Radiological gross total resection was obtained in 46 cases (44 %). The US correctly predicted postoperative residue in 83 % cases (sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 78 % respectively; positive and negative predictive values of 82 and 84 %). There were 9 false positives and 6 false negative cases. When the US was false positive, the resolution was more often good (7 of 9 cases); whereas when there were false negatives, it was more likely to be less than optimal (4 of 6). Morbidity was 17 % and this was not related to the additional resections. In the subset of glioblastoma patients (n = 28) use of NUS was associated with significantly better progression-free as well as overall survival rates. Conclusions: NUS {{is a useful}} intraoperative adjunct in controlling resections. It positively and decisively influences the intraoperative course of the surgery.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the diagnostic accuracy of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurement in preoperative grading and differentiation of solitary <b>intra-axial</b> malignant brain <b>tumors.</b> METHODS: Thirty-six low-grade glial tumors (LGGTs), 22 high-grade glial tumors (HGGTs), and 17 metastases (METs) were prospectively evaluated by MR imaging and standard dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced gradient echo, echoplanar imaging during first pass of a bolus injection of contrast material. Normalized rCBV values from tumoral (rCBVT) and peritumoral (rCBVP) areas were calculated by standard software and statistically tested independently. RESULTS: The mean differences of rCBVT and rCBVP values between LGGT (2. 30 1. 12 and 1. 18 0. 24) and HGGT (5. 42 1. 52 and 2. 17 0. 82) (P <. 001); HGGTs and METs (3. 21 0. 98 and 0. 97 0. 09) (P <. 001); and LGGTs and METs (P <. 05 and P <. 001, respectively) were significant. No clear cutoff value was present. A clear rCBVT cutoff value of 2. 6 was detected for differentiation of low- (1. 75 0. 38; LGA) versus high-grade (4. 78 0. 99; HGA) astrocytomas when nonastrocytic glial tumors were excluded. The rCBVT values wer...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (dMRI) is a reproducible technique for determining exchange parameters and tissue compartments with high resolution throughout the human body. In the past, only low-molecular-weight, gadolinium (Gd) -based contrast agents were approved for clinical MRI in humans. Gd contrast agents are well tolerated, and MRI is highly sensitive in demonstrating their effects. Low-molecular-weight contrast media such as Gd-DTPA extravasate within {{a few seconds of}} injection. To improve separation of the signal contributions from intra- and extravascular contrast material, a low-molecular weight agent is injected into a peripheral vein as a rapid bolus over a few seconds. The contrast bolus flows through the capillary bed in highly concentrated form before it disperses evenly in the blood. Imaging of vascularization must capture the initial phase after injection when most of the administered bolus is still in the vessel and has not yet dispersed in blood. Low-molecular-weight Gd-based contrast media alter two parameters that can be measured by MRI: they shorten T 1 and T 2 relaxation times. Both effects can be used to visualize a bolus of contrast medium. In a first approximation, T 1 -weighted sequences provide images with a linear relationship between signal intensity and contrast medium concentration over a wide range. Signal changes are proportional to contrast medium concentrations and thus enable determination of vascular volume at rather low concentrations. High contrast medium concentrations lead to saturation and subsequent signal loss on T 1 -weighted sequences. On T 2 /T 2 *-weighted sequences, low concentrations of Gd-based contrast medium cause a slight signal loss with a subsequent exponential signal decrease at slightly higher concentrations. For these reasons, T 1 -weighted sequences are predominantly used to depict the contrast bolus at low contrast medium concentrations or extravasation at high concentrations. T 2 /T 2 *-weighted sequences only visualize a high-dose contrast bolus. The combination of T 1 -weighted MR imaging with bolus injection of contrast medium enables use of more sophisticated techniques for quantitative determination of vascular and interstitial volumes and exchange parameters. Such techniques rely on evaluation methods and a suitable pharmacokinetic model that specifically describes the predominant concentration and exchange processes for the low-molecular-weight contrast medium used. A model found to be suitable for this purpose is a 3 -compartment model. Such a model has been used for pharmacokinetic imaging of the brain before and is for the first time applied to the prostate in the present study. In the present study, a number of pharmacokinetic parameters could be quantified using the 3 compartment model. The diagnostic relevance of blood volume was investigated for glioma grading in a ROC analysis. The results suggest that the accuracy of a parameter derived from quantitative blood volume distributions is comparable to that of biopsy. Perfusion is a less relevant parameter than blood volume in assessing brain tumors. Other tumors investigated were meningiomas and distant metastases. Meningiomas differ from gliomas in two respects: they have a markedly larger blood volume and different microenvironment. Contrast medium extravasation has been divided into two bidirectional transport processes – one fast and one slow – which are also known as permeability into two separate interstitial volumes. Fast permeability can only serve to differentiate extra-axial <b>tumors</b> (meningiomas) from <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> (gliomas and distant metastases). Slow permeability can be used to characterize necrotic tumors and thus allows differentiation of glioblastomas from low-grade gliomas in the brain. Perfusion, blood volume, and interstitial volume {{have been shown to be}} diagnostically relevant parameters. To improve representation of differences in microenvironment, scatter diagrams were used in which interstitial volume is plotted against blood volume. The results show that, based on their microenviroments, different tumor entities occupy different areas in such diagrams. For dMRI of the prostate, the pharmacokinetic model has been extended to encompass prostate cancer as a new tumor entity. Only a few study groups have so far used dMRI for imaging of prostate cancer, and most investigators did not quantify compartments and exchange constants. Since perfusion in the prostate is not the same as in the brain, a novel dual-contrast pulse sequence was used for dMRI. This sequence also visualizes the contrast bolus in prostate tissue. The evaluation method and pharmacokinetic model were further modified for analysis of dMRI of the prostate. The refined method differs from that used for analysis of cerebral MRI in that additional intensity homogenization and motion correction are applied prior to analysis. Phase images are used to correct for pulsations of the AIF. It is necessary to take into account not only delay relative to the AIF but also bolus dispersion in order to adequately describe arrival of contrast medium at the target site. The dual echo sequence with use of a markedly longer echo time for the second echo enabled quantification of mean transfer time and perfusion as additional parameters. It was shown that perfusion is significantly higher in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue. Unlike for brain tumors, it was found that perfusion is a more relevant parameter than blood volume for prostate imaging. In conclusion, use of a 3 -compartment model enables detailed and spatially resolved analysis of tissue parameters...|$|R
