Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|The Burzahom {{archaeological site}} {{is located in}} the Kashmir Valley of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Archaeological {{excavations}} have revealed four phases of cultural significance between 3000 BC and 1000 BC. Periods I and II represent the Neolithic era; Period IlI the Megalithic era (of massive stone menhirs and wheel turned red pottery); and Period IV relates to the early Historical Period (Post-megalithic period). The findings, recorded in stratified cultural deposits representing prehistoric human activity in Kashmir, are based on detailed <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> cover all aspects of the physical evidence of the site, including the ancient flora and fauna.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Japan was undergoing a transformation into a more industrial nation and while advancing its scientific understanding in many fields. Damage from the event was widespread and the loss of life was significant. The many kilometers of visible fault breaks {{on the surface of the}} earth presented scientists with opportunities for field <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> ultimately led to an improved understanding of the fault scarps that earthquakes often generate.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E

5|$|In 837, Theophilos {{raised him}} {{to the rank of}} patrikios and sent him {{together}} with the general Theophobos in a campaign against the Abasgians, but the Byzantines were defeated. With the death of Theophilos, the young Michael III (r. 842–867) ascended the throne. As he was only two years old, a regency council was set up headed by Theodora. Bardas and his brother Petronas, as well as their relative Sergios Niketiates, were also members, but it was the logothete Theoktistos who quickly established himself as Theodora's chief advisor. Bardas still played {{an active role in the}} early days of the regency, encouraging Theodora to abandon Iconoclasm for good and taking part in the <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> led to the deposition of the pro-iconoclast patriarch John the Grammarian and the restoration of the veneration of icons in 843. In 844, however, Theoktistos blamed Bardas for the desertions that led to the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Mauropotamos against the Abbasids, even though the logothete himself led the Byzantine army, and had him exiled from Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E
5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E

5|$|The Dixie Mission had {{consequences}} for individuals, {{and for the}} nation. Many participants were accused of being communists, such as John Davies and John Service. Both were subjected to multiple Congressional <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> consistently found {{that they were not}} Communist Party members, agents of foreign powers, or disloyal to the United States. This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department. He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor. Davies was exiled from China, his field of expertise, by Hurley. Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America. Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture. Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with the KMT and the CPC. He succeeded in preventing Barrett from promotion to brigadier general, even though Barrett's promotion was endorsed by the theater commander, General Albert C. Wedemeyer. Barrett was retained in the China Theater, but placed in an inferior position.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different <b>investigations</b> <b>that</b> used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E

One of these men was Gen. Charles P. Cabell. Another important change came when General William Garland joined Cabell's staff; Garland thought the UFO question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO.|$|E
