25|$|Facial angiofibromas {{occur in}} 80% of {{patients}} with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began {{during the early stages}} of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, <b>gel,</b> <b>solution,</b> and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation.|$|E
50|$|One type of BAL {{is similar}} to kidney {{dialysis}} systems that employ a hollow fiber cartridge. Hepatocytes are suspended in a <b>gel</b> <b>solution,</b> such as collagen, which is injected {{into a series of}} hollow fibers. In the case of collagen, the suspension is then gelled within the fibers, usually by a temperature change. The hepatocytes then contract the gel by their attachment to the collagen matrix, reducing the volume of the suspension and creating a flow space within the fibers. Nutrient media is circulated through the fibers to sustain the cells. During use, plasma is removed from the patients blood. The patient's plasma is fed into the space surrounding the fibers. The fibers, which are composed of a semi-permeable membrane, facilitate transfer of toxins, nutrients and other chemicals between the blood and the suspended cells. The membrane also keeps immune bodies, such as immunoglobulins, from passing to the cells to prevent an immune system rejection.|$|E
5000|$|The team {{divided the}} {{restorative}} tasks into phases {{to accommodate the}} piece's large dimensions. The process began with the reverse side. Examinations indicated that the preparatory layer was made from a mixture of white led barium sulfate and calcium carbonate. The fabric of the canvas had a large tear nearly 7 ft long. The tear was sutured, thread by thread, using a mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat starch. The canvas's face was cleaned in two phases: the first consisted of removing dust that had accumulated on the surface. The second involved using a <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> to remove dirt that had become attached to the surface. Any polychrome losses were then replaced by applying a putty made from ground calcite (also known as [...] "blanc d’Espanya") and rabbit-skin glue. The restoration of The Great Day of Girona is considered an exceptional project due to its application of minimum intervention criteria and use of innovative techniques {{and has become a}} benchmark of restoration work throughout Spain.|$|E
30|$|The {{molecular}} {{weight of the}} modified cellulose is considerably {{higher than that of}} acrylamide monomer, so the initial performance of the <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> mainly depends on the amount of modified cellulose. Thus, it can characterize the performance of the <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> by analyzing the performance of the modified cellulose solution.|$|R
30|$|Over the years, {{different}} types of gel treatments have been utilized {{in an attempt to}} solve conformance control problems. Initially, industry started using in situ gels in which <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> is injected into reservoir and crosslinking of <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> to form 3 -D bulk gel occurs downhole. This technology was quickly dropped due to its inherent disadvantages such as selective injectivity, possible damage to low permeability zones, dispersion and dilution of gelant, syneresis, dehydration, and inadequate control of gelation time (Seright 1990; Young et al. 1988; Asghari 1999; Bryant et al. 1996; Willhite et al. 1986).|$|R
30|$|In situ {{cross-linking}} {{polymer gel}} was widely used for water plugging in oilfield production, {{and a good}} result was achieved (Tang et al. 1996). This technology is that acrylamide, methylene diacrylamide and initiator were injected into the formation to form a high strength gel by in situ polymerization. The two most typical were “K-trol” and “TP system”, which were developed by Halliburton company in USA and PetroChina Exploration and Development Research Institute, respectively (Vossoughi 2000; Li 1988). The initial viscosity of the <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> was approximate 2  mPa s, which was almost equal to the viscosity of water, so that it had good pumping capability. A successful application of the technology was in Lick Creek oilfield (Woods et al. 1986). However, the technology had obvious flaw (Jia and Pu 2013): (1) The <b>gelling</b> <b>solution</b> was easy to be diluted by formation water and the reducing agents in the formation water could make the initiator lose efficacy; (2) The <b>gelling</b> <b>solutions</b> with low viscosity were easy to enter into low permeability layer to greatly lead to wrong plugging; (3) The gelation time was short so that the technology only plugged the near-wellbore area. So the application of this technology was limited due to these unfavorable factors.|$|R

30|$|The {{change in}} shear stress with shear rate at {{different}} reaction time intervals and pH was studied using Physica Rheolab MC 1. It was {{observed that the}} polymer <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> is non-Newtonian, and the values of shear stress increase with increasing shear rate which indicates that the viscosity of solution is shear rate-dependent. Also, {{it was observed that}} the values of shear stress increases with temperature at constant shear rate, which reflects that the viscosity of cross-linked polymer <b>gel</b> <b>solution</b> increases with temperature with the passage of time. This increased viscosity leads to gel formation which in turn behaves as flow-diverting agent or blocking agent for controlling excessive water production in the oil fields. There is no strong effect of pH on the rheological behavior of HMTA and pyrocatechol cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide gel system. Different polymer gel systems have different ranges of pH over which they can maintain their stability. All the experiments were carried out at pH 7.5.|$|E

In {{the second round of}} CO 2 injection for enhancing the gelation environment, the permeability reduction rate increased with the injection of CO 2 and can reach to more than 80  %, which was observed during the experimental processes. This performance indicates that gel with a certain extent of strength can be achieved under the condition of fluid flow.|$|E
