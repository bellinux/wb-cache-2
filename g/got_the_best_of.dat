25|$|In 1987, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the motion picture, Simon Hawke {{produced}} a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again.

25|$|The Minutemen {{made it to}} the ECWHL {{championship}} game to close each of the league's first three seasons, but as was the pattern of the time, lost each to URI (the Rams were the circuit's dominant team early on and would not lose an ECWHL playoff game until 2011). The maroon and white did, however, fire off back-to-back ACHA National Tournament bids in 2005 and 2006. The first was the stronger of the two runs, thanks to a 3–1 pool win over Michigan, powered by Emily Slotnick's game-winning goal and two assists, that sent UMass through to the quarterfinals.

Christine and Paul reunited but were unaware that Isabella was still alive.

25|$|An NBA interstate rivalry, both in Texas {{linked by}} I-45, {{as well as}} both Dallas and Houston fans {{traditionally}} having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This {{is also known as}} the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on Interstate 45. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980–81, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116-68 blowout win. In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988, and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game fixing. and the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995 the Mavericks were able to get one of their most superb victories against the Houston reigning champion for 156–147 scoring 23 points in the first overtime. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first ever regular season's game played in Mexico City and won by the Rockets 108–106. In recent years the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Mark Cuban and Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46M, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving, causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player Jason Terry, who was a starter on the Mavs' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2015 season, and both teams met {{in the first round of}} the 2015 NBA Playoffs, with the Rockets as the 2nd seed and Mavericks the 7th seed, and the Rockets <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> them 4-1.|$|E
25|$|On stage 3 of the Tour de Suisse, Sagan {{showed that}} {{he still has the}} ability to climb with the best in the sport. After making the {{selection}} on the category one climb, Sagan was able to distance himself along with Rui Costa, Roman Kreuziger and Mathias Frank on the final wet and narrow descent. The four held off {{the rest of the field}} and Sagan took the stage victory. Sagan cemented his victory in the points classification by taking the eighth stage, which was flatter and more suited to the sprinters. He <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> Daniele Bennati and Philippe Gilbert. He then went on to win the Slovak Road Race Championships for the third time, stating that he would be happy to harbor the national emblem on his jersey for the Tour de France. At the Tour, Sagan scored numerous second positions before winning stage 7 to Albi, after his team worked to shed the pure sprinters on the Category 2 Col de la Croix de Mounis. He outsprinted the select group he was part of, crossing the line before John Degenkolb. Sagan retained the green jersey to Paris and dyed his beard green to underline that victory. He then went on to win the sprints classification and numerous stages in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge (4 stage wins) and the Tour of Alberta (2 stage wins). Sagan got short of success in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec where he accelerated strongly on one of the final climbs but faded in sight of the finishing line. He compensated two days later by taking victory in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, escaping the leading group on a climb with five kilometers to go and winning solo.|$|E

25|$|Sabatini {{started the}} 1995 season by {{reaching}} the semifinals in Sydney, where she faced Mary Joe Fernández {{in what was}} a rematch of the previous year. At the 1994 Sydney tournament, Fernández put Sabatini away in straight sets in that semifinal encounter. This time, she won in straight sets, snapping a three match losing streak against Fernandez. Sabatini then defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final in straight sets in {{what was to be}} the last singles title of her career. At the 1995 Australian Open, Sabatini, seeded fifth, was dismissed by Marianne Werdel in the first round. In the semifinals of the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Sabatini was leading Kimiko Date 6–1, 5–1 before squandering three match points and double faulting 18 times as Date rallied to beat Sabatini with a scoreline of 1–6, 7–6, 7–6. It {{turned out to be a}} repeat performance of the 1993 French Open quarterfinals, where Sabatini lost an identical lead of 6–1, 5–1 against Mary Joe Fernández. At the 1995 French Open, Sabatini looked to put that memory behind her when she faced second seeded Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals. However, Graf proved too strong for Sabatini and won in straight sets. Later that summer at Wimbledon, Sabatini, seeded eighth, lost to defending champion and third-seeded Conchita Martínez of Spain in the quarterfinals. Martínez had clearly turned the tables against Sabatini in their rivalry, beating Sabatini four out of their last five meetings. At the final grand slam of the year, the US Open in New York, Sabatini beat Martina Hingis in the round of 16. She then defeated Mary Joe Fernández in the quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Graf. With the victory, Graf had now <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> Sabatini in eight consecutive matches. Against Graf, this also marked the 40th match and final time the two would meet since their rivalry began in 1985 with Graf winning 29.|$|E

[...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control."

Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees."

[...] (Sometimes this last threat was simply abbreviated: as [...] "Bang, zoom!") On other occasions, Ralph simply told Alice, [...] "Oh, are you gonna get yours."

But, Ralph never carried out his threats, and others {{have pointed out that}} Alice knew he never would because of their deep love for each other In retaliation, the targets of Ralph's verbal abuse often responded by simply joking about his weight, a common theme throughout the series.

En route to a meeting in Paris to discuss this (1 November), Lloyd George told Wilson, Smuts and Hankey that he was toying with the idea of sending Haig to command the British and French forces in Italy. At the meeting (4 November), Lloyd George accused Haig of encouraging press attacks on him. Haig was making similar complaints about Lloyd George, whom he privately compared to the Germans accusing the Allies of atrocities, of which they were guilty. Haig volunteered to write to J. A.
