By contrast, this article argues that although miracles are <b>divine</b> <b>interventions,</b> they are not violations of the laws of nature.

The main claim of this article is that laws of nature do not entail regularities, and that therefore miracles do not violate the laws.

50|$|The {{idea that}} there had been a series of episodes of divine {{creation}} of new species with many thousands of years in between them, serving to prepare the world for the eventual arrival of humanity, was popular with Anglican geologists like William Buckland in the early 19th century; they proposed it as an explanation for the patterns of faunal succession in the fossil record that showed that the types of organisms that lived on the earth had changed over time. Buckland explained the idea in detail in his book Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology (1836), which was one of the eight Bridgewater Treatises. Buckland presented this idea in part to counter pre-Darwin theories on the transmutation of species. The Scottish geologist and evangelical Christian Hugh Miller also argued for many separate creation events brought about by <b>divine</b> <b>interventions,</b> and explained his ideas in his book The testimony of the rocks; or, Geology in its bearings on the two theologies, natural and revealed in 1857.|$|R

Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to <b>divine</b> <b>intervention</b> to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years).

This article surveys the reign of the first Christian emperor and examines how he developed the role of the Christian imperial theocrat in his public letters and imperial actions, how Lactantius in the west and Eusebius in the east codified that role in their writings to and about Constantine, and how the role pioneered by him in Late Antiquity served as a model for Byzantine emperors in eastern Europe and for medieval kings in western Europe over the next millennium.

5|$|An {{example of}} the chronicle's bias against the {{descendants}} of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson {{is one of the}} two miracle narratives preserved by this source. The story in question is about a miracle attributed to St Mary, which may have been incorporated into the chronicle in order to discredit the reign of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Whatever the case, the story deals with an aged chieftain named Domnall, who is described as a close friend of Haraldr Óláfsson, and regarded by the latter as worthier than others. The chronicle relates how Domnall and his young son were forced to flee from Haraldr Guðrøðarson to the sanctuary of the Church of St Mary at Rushen. The latter, however, is stated to have tricked them into leaving the church-grounds, whereupon they were immediately seized. It was in this time of need, so the story says, that Domnall's prayers to St Mary were answered, and that it was through her <b>divine</b> <b>intervention</b> that he and his son escaped from their imprisonment. The chronicle states that Domnall himself recounted the story to the chronicle's compilers. The account itself seems to have been used as means to portray Haraldr Guðrøðarson as a distrustful oath-breaker, and thereby further discredit the line of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson; conversely, the connection between Haraldr Óláfsson and the divinely favoured Domnall may have been intended to imply legitimacy in regards to Óláfr's line. Although the identities of Domnall and his son are uncertain, there is reason to suspect that they are identical to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, and his son, Aonghus Mór (died c. 1293).|$|E

Focus has shifted away from religious enmities {{to a set of}} less-explored issues. Which of the messages propagated in homilies did laymen adopt and adapt or reject? Did believers focus on consolation and protection or emphasise punishments and sin? These questions are addressed by studying the Thirty Years War at a local level. The study compares how pastors and lay chroniclers described <b>divine</b> <b>interventions.</b> Erfurt in Central Germany is well-suited for such a case-study. The Lutheran town, with a Catholic minority, hosted a Swedish garrison in 1631 - 1635 and 1637 - 1650. The historical works of twenty-six local authors who lived during the war are described in the appendix. The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first examines the many prodigies that never made it to print; the second section inspects debates amongst Lutheran pastors; the third analyses lay war-time piety. Erfurt is examined in order {{to take a closer look}} at general developments. Hence, local debates are connected to broader theological discussion. The contextualisation shows that the war strengthened the Lutheran reform movement and proved detrimental to millenarian policy-making. The potential for change was restrained in other fields. During the war, lay commitment to the call for repentance was lowered by practical considerations and alternative ways of apportioning blame. These challenges diminished after war. Authors highlighted prodigies and exempla in harmony with the penitential baseline. The theory of cognitive dissonance is used to explain the selection and gradual stabilisation of religious beliefs. The findings thus refine existing hypotheses, outlining a range of long-term cultural changes in the wake of the war. More casestudies are needed to test how representative Erfurt findings are. Sources on the Catholic minority only sufficed to profile some denominational peculiarities...|$|R

Though the middle Pandava Arjuna - disguised as a brahmin - wins her in her swayamvara, Draupadi is compelled to marry all the five brothers on command of her mother-in-law Kunti. Pandavas agree to the plan that Draupadi will always be the chief consort of all brothers and always the empress. She will be in personal union with one brother every year and may bear him a child. Anyone of the other 4, who interrupts them during a private time within that one year, must go on a 11-month prilgrimage.

She mothers five sons from each of the Pandavas, regaining her virginity after every year.

In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – <b>Divine</b> <b>Intervention</b> and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars.

With the aim of contributing to the debate between containment and utopian readings, I explore in this thesis how late romance produces its subjects. I interrogate the plays’ structures {{with the help of the}} anthropological model of the limen, which is shown to be a useful category through which to educe the meaningfulness of certain ritual sequences. The limen’s three phases – separation; limen; aggregation – are employed to make sense of the transitions that subjects undergo in the four plays studied: Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter’s Tale, and The Tempest. To study the liminality of these plays is, I argue, to study how dramatic subjects are produced therein, guided by the fact that their language shares properties with ritual discourse. When studying this discourse the focus falls on that class of language which impinges most lastingly on subjects: performatives. How performatives function in late romance will show us how real the changes induced in liminal subjects are. I examine the four plays in turn and find that their performative language produces subjects in a limen-consistent fashion. Aristocratic subjects are first of all estranged from those discursive practices that nourish their identity; their subjectivities are then glued back together in the ritualised, emblematising language of the limen. The conclusion I draw from my interrogation of the liminal patterns uncovered is that the functionality of late romance is broadly consistent with containment readings; I claim to have extended such readings, however, in showing that Shakespeare’s dramatisation of the state’s return to power usefully exposes its logic and symbolic grammar...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the study of antebellum American religious novels is hindered by the secularization narrative, the widely held conviction that modernity entails the decline of religion. Because this narrative has been refuted by the growing field of secularization theory and because the novel is associated with modernity, the novel form must be reexamined. Specifically, I challenge the common definition of the novel as a secular form. By investigating novels by Lydia Maria Child, Susan Warner, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Hannah Bond, I show that religion and the novel form are not opposed. In fact, scholars' unexamined and unacknowledged definitions of religion and secularity cause imprecision. For example, the Marxist definition of religion as ideology causes misrepresentations of novels with evangelical purposes, such as Warner's The Wide, Wide World and Bond's The Bondwoman's Narrative. Both novels feature protagonists who submit [...] one to patriarchy and the other to slavery [...] a stance that appears masochistic to feminist scholars and critics of slave narratives, respectively. However, attending to the biblical allusions, <b>divine</b> <b>interventions,</b> and theological arguments that saturate these texts places them in another framework altogether and reveals that they are commenting not on one's relationship with other humans but with God. Likewise, unexamined definitions of the secular are problematic because critics often conflate two definitions: the etymological sense of "earthly" and the modern sense of "anti-religious. " This slippage underlies the view that religious literature of the nineteenth century became less religious, when it simply became more grounded in daily life. Therefore, to label as "secular" an author like Stowe, who promoted an earthly, lived Christianity, is only accurate if one means "mundane. " Finally, my dissertation demonstrates that literary criticism itself relies on the secularization narrative, perceiving itself as modern and progressive. This reliance obscures the role literature has played in constructing this narrative. For example, colonial novels like Hobomok and The Scarlet Letter rewrite American religious history to exclude Calvinism. Noting how our investment in secularity has delimited interpretive possibilities, this project opens the way for increased clarity in the study of religion in literature...|$|R
