40|$|Background The first {{commercial}} system for digital radiography {{was introduced in}} 1987, and it has evolved a great deal since then. Currently, {{it is possible to}} enhance images in digital radiography. Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of image enhancement in <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> as it relates to interproximal carries assessment. Materials and Methods Following extraction, 50 human teeth were kept in acidic gel (methyl cellulose + acetate buffer PH = 4. 8) for 42 days at 37 °C to cause caries before mounting. <b>Direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> was then taken. Two filters were used: sharpen and emboss. Three radiologists evaluated the images with two weeks interval. The histologic assessments were gold standard. Additionally, SPSS 20 was used to draw an ROC curve and calculate AUC. Cohen’s kappa and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to measure intra- and inter-observer reliability. Results For the emboss filter, sensitivity was 95 %, specificity was 100 %, and accuracy was 96 %. For the sharpen filter, sensitivity was 88 %, specificity was 100 %, and accuracy was 90 %. Also, the AUC for the emboss filter was 0. 97, and it was 0. 94 for the sharpen filter. Cohen’s simple kappa was in the range of excellent. Conclusions Using these filters in intra-oral <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> (especially the emboss filter) can help some clinicians to increase diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of inter proximal caries of posterior teeth...|$|R

It covers time period from discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1895, over the conventional Radiography to the current methods and trends of the digital Radiography. For this important discovery, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, german physicist, got the Nobel Prize in 1901. This work provides complex information about X-ray technology and describes the image creation procedure. The "Analog Radiography" chapter describes Radiography equipment and the projection type transition: from the conventional film screen radiography to the computed and <b>direct</b> <b>radiography.</b> In case of the Computed radiography (CR) the cassette containing the X-ray film {{is replaced by a}} cassette with the photostimulable phosphor.

40|$|Objectives: The {{diagnosis}} of caries lesions {{is still a}} matter of concern in dentistry. The {{diagnosis of}} dental caries by digital radiography {{has a number of}} advantages over conventional radiography; however, this method has not been explored fully in the field of paediatric dentistry. This in vitro research evaluated the accuracy of <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> compared with visual inspection and conventional radiography in the diagnosis of occlusal caries lesions in primary molars. Methods: 50 molars were selected and evaluated under standardized conditions by 2 previously calibrated examiners according to 3 diagnostic methods (visual inspection, conventional <b>radiography</b> and <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography).</b> <b>Direct</b> digital radiographs were obtained with the Dixi 3 system (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) and the conventional radiographs with InSight film (Kodak Eastman Co., Rochester, NY). The images were scored and a reference standard was obtained histologically. The interexaminer reliability was calculated using Cohen`s kappa test and the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of the methods were calculated. Results: Examiner reliability was good. For lesions limited to the enamel, visual inspection showed significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy than both radiographic methods, but no significant difference was found in specificity. For teeth with dentinal caries, {{no significant differences were found}} for any parameter when comparing visual and radiographic evaluation. Conclusions: Although less accurate than the visual method for detecting caries lesions confined to the enamel, the direct digital radiographic method is as effective as conventional radiographic examination and visual inspection of primary teeth with occlusal caries when the dentine is involved.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Digital {{panoramic}} X-ray {{images can}} be captured using photostimulable phosphors or solidstate detectors (i. e. charge-coupled devices and Flat-Panels). The first category is defined as computed radiography (CR) or semi-direct radiography. The second technology that uses solid-state detectors is known as <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> (DDR). Both of these technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. One {{of the most important}} fields in comparison of these systems is their resultant image quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the subjective image quality of DDR and CR digital panoramic system, and to assess the overall density and contrast of their images. METHODS: 200 patients were randomly allocated to two digital systems: Promax [central control digital (CCD) ] and XC [photostimulable phosphor plates (PSP) ]. Image quality was evaluated in six regions on a 3 -point scale by three oral and maxillofacial radiologists independently. In addition, observers assessed overall density and contrast of each image on a 3 -point scale. RESULTS: Using chi-square test, no statistically significant differences were found (P > 0. 05) in subjective image quality of anatomic structures between the two radiographic systems. But DDR system outperformed CR system in overall density and contrast of the image. P values for both overall density and contrast of the images was less than 0. 001. CONCLUSION: The subjective image quality of CR and DDR panoramic systems in specified anatomic regions were found statistically comparable in this study. In overall density and contrast of the radiographs, DDR system proved better than CR system.

In four studies, artificial bone lesions were made periapically and interradicularly in the mandibular premolar and molar regions. In a clinical study, direct digital radiographic images depicting the periapical bone tissue of different regions were assessed. Digital subtraction was performed on digitised conventional periapical radiographs. The observer performance was significantly better for the subtraction images than for the conventional radiographs, in particular for the detection of shallow lesions. Periapical bone lesions were easier to detect than interradicular lesions. <b>Direct</b> digtal <b>radiography</b> was performed with a CCD sensor based imaging system, Visualix/VIXA.

40|$|To {{implement}} a digital service essentially means {{transition from the}} established SFR technique (i. e. screen-film radiography) to predominantly CR (Computed Radiography) or DR (<b>Direct</b> <b>Radiography).</b> The stated methods of digitalization differ {{in their use of}} a range of types of diagnostic equipment and image digitalization devices. The utilization of individual methods can, however, lead to different results in the amount of skin entry radiation dose and organs absorbed dose in patients undergoing ionizing radiation examination. The objective of this thesis is to compare individual methods (i. e. SFR, CR, DR) generally used for image digitalization in respect of radiation stress for patients. Radiation stress was compared both by measuring entry radiation dose on phantoms and by clinical results acquired from a KAP meter. To validate clinical results, the three most often examinations have been chosen: skull, chest, and stomach examinations. This selection was affected by its frequency and amount of radiation stress. The measured results were then compared with available foreign literature. On the basis of the measurements acquired, it is apparent that <b>Direct</b> <b>Radiography</b> leads to radical reduction in radiation dose in patients. As regards Computed Radiography, it cannot be generally said whether it entails a lower dose in patients. The measured and consequently published figures imply that there are significant differences amongst individual manufactures of CR systems (for example Fuji, Kodak, Konica, etc.) which do or do not lead, in comparison with SFR, to a lower radiation stress. According to the measurements published in this thesis, it can be stated that the use of state-of-the art CR technology could lead to reduction as high as 50 percent of the radiation stress if compared to SFR...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the femoral anteversion (FA) angle with clinical and radiological evaluations {{in patients with}} cerebral palsy (CP) and also to determine the relationship between radiologic imaging methods and clinical evaluation. Materials and Methods: For clinical evaluation of FA, Craig’s test, and for radiological evaluation of FA, <b>direct</b> <b>radiography</b> (the Rippstein-Müller method), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 7. 2 ± 1. 77 (5 - 11) years. The mean FA angles were 38. 2 °± 8. 4 ° (20 °- 50 °) (Craig’s test), 56. 5 °± 14. 28 ° (25 °- 100 °) (radiograph), 29. 0 °± 10. 5 ° (7 °- 49 °) (CT) and 37. 3 °± 10. 6 ° (11 °- 68 °) (MRI), respectively. The FA angle was significantly higher in patients with hip adductor muscle spasticity than in patients without adductor spasticity (p< 0. 05). The FA angles evaluated by Craig’s test and CT were correlated with hip internal rotation measurements and the FA angle with MRI was correlated with the difference between hip internal and external rotation measurements. When FA angle measurement methods were compared, Craig’s test positively correlated with CT and x-ray imaging and also, MRI positively correlated with <b>direct</b> <b>radiography.</b> Conclusion: The FA angle is high in children with CP. Hip adductor spasticity, increased hip internal rotation and the difference between hip internal and external rotation measurements on physical examination are cautionary signs for an increased FA angle. In this regard, Craig’s test appears to be a clinically relevant method for determining the FA angle.

Experimental results show that, for the medical X-ray DDR images, the proposed comprehensive preprocessing algorithm can not only greatly enhance the contrast and detail information, but also improve the resolution capability of DDR system. 1...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{technical}} and clinical screening performance parameters between computed <b>radiography</b> (CR) and <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> (DR) systems. METHODS: The {{number of women}} screened with CR was 73, 008 and with DR 116, 945. Technical and patient dose survey data of 25 CR and 37 DR systems were available. Technical performance was expressed by threshold thickness values at the mean glandular dose (MGD) level of routine practice. Clinical indicators included recall rate (RR), cancer detection rate (CDR), percentage of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), percentage of cancers with T-scores smaller than 1  cm and positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: Contrast threshold values for the 0. 1 -mm gold disk were 1. 44  μm (SD 0. 13  μm) for CR and 1. 20  μm (SD 0. 13  μm for DR). MGD was 2. 16  mGy (SD 0. 36  mGy) and 1. 35  mGy (SD 0. 32  mGy) for CR and DR respectively. We obtained for CR, respectively DR, the following results: RR {{in the first round}} of 5. 48  % versus 5. 61  %; RR in subsequent rounds of 2. 52  % versus 2. 65  %; CDR of 0. 52  % versus 0. 53  %; DCIS of 0. 08  % versus 0. 11  %; a rate of cancers with T-scores smaller than 1  cm of 0. 11  % versus 0. 11  %; PPV of 18. 45  % versus 18. 64  %; none of them was significantly different. CONCLUSION: Our screening indicators are reassuring for the use of CR and DR, with CR operating at 60  % higher MGD. KEY POINTS : • Breast cancer screening can employ both computed (CR) and <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> (DR). • Screening performance parameters for CR and DR technology are not significantly different. • Screening parameters are in accordance with European Guidelines. • Radiation doses employed for CR are generally 60  % greater than for DR. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{discuss a}} case of a {{professional}} rugby front-row forward who presented with bilateral pedicle stress fractures at T 7 and relate the case to the relevant literature. The patient was evaluated with <b>direct</b> <b>radiography,</b> scintigraphy, MRI and high resolution CT with axial, coronal, sagittal and oblique reconstructions. These investigations were conducted over a 12 month period following the onset of mild thoracic pain. Traumatic spinal fracture dislocations with minimal or no cord injury are extremely rare, with only 15 cases reported in the scientific literature to date. The patient's radiological findings were evaluated and compared with the 15 cases of pedicle shear fractures reported by Shapiro et al. in 2002. The presented patient had no specific history of trauma and developed gradual pain from repeated scrummaging. The authors have been unable to find any reported case of bilateral thoracic pedicle fractures that have not resulted from some form of severe injury or iatrogenesis, and believe the following case to be the first reported case of bilateral stress fractures of the thoracic pedicles (T 7). 3 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Osteoporosis (OP) is a {{major cause}} of disability, {{morbidity}} and mortaliy. Causes are significant economic burden with fractures. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the only technique that is defined as the gold standard that the World Health Organization currently recommends in determining the fracture risk. The use of direct radiographic examinations is recommended for the causes of false negative results in densitometric examination and for the detection of fracture presenting as OP indicator in clinical practice. The {{purpose of this study is}} a retrospective investigation of the need for DXA methodology, which we routinely use for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of OP, in patients with fractures by <b>direct</b> <b>radiography.</b> Materials and Methods: The data of 189 postmenopausal women with DXA, lateral thoracic and lumbar graphy without trauma history, retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to DXA results, group 1 consisted 167 postmenopausal women with OP and group 2 consisted 22 postmenopausal women with no OP. In both groups, patients who have at least one fracture according to thoracic and lumbar graphy were evaluated. Results: At least one vertebrae height loss was detected in 61 (32. 28...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} if <b>direct</b> <b>radiography</b> (DR) performs {{better than}} screen-film mammography (SF) and computed radiography (CR) in dense breasts in a decentralized organised Breast Cancer Screening Programme. To this end, screen-detected versus interval cancers were studied in different BI-RADS density classes for these imaging modalities. The study cohort consisted of 351, 532 women {{who participated in}} the Flemish Breast Cancer Screening Programme in 2009 and 2010. Information on screen-detected and interval cancers, breast density scores of radiologist second readers, and imaging modality was obtained by linkage of the databases of the Centre of Cancer Detection and the Belgian Cancer Registry. Overall, 67 % of occurring breast cancers are screen detected and 33 % are interval cancers, with DR performing better than SF and CR. The interval cancer rate increases gradually with breast density, regardless of modality. In the high-density class, the interval cancer rate exceeds the cancer detection rate for SF and CR, but not for DR. DR is superior to SF and CR with respect to cancer detection rates for high-density breasts. To reduce the high interval cancer rate in dense breasts, use of an additional imaging technique in screening can be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{advent of}} digital imaging in radioalogy, {{combined}} with the expolosive growth of technology, has dramtcally improved imaging techniques. This {{has led to the}} expansion of diagnostic capabilities, both {{in terms of the number}} of procedures and their scope. Throughout the world, film / screen radiography systems are being rapidly replaced with digital systems. Many progressive medical institutions have acquired, or are considering the purchase of, computed radiography systems with strorage phosphor plates or <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography</b> systems with flat panel detectors. However, unknown to some users, these devices offer a new paradigm of opportunity and challenges. Images can be obtained at a lower dose due to the higher detective quantum efficiency. These fundamental differences in compasrison to conventional film / screens necessitate the development of new strategies for dose and quality optimisations. A set of referral criteria based upon three dose levels is proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-seven {{different}} elements were tested for their suitability as converter screens for {{direct and indirect}} fast neutron radiography. The use of commercial X-ray scintillator screens containing YTaO{sub 4 }, LaOBr:Tm, YTaO{sub 4 }:Nb, YTaO{sub 4 }:Tm, CaWO{sub 4 }, BaSO{sub 4 }:Sr, and GdO{sub 2 }S:Tb was also explored for <b>direct</b> fast neutron <b>radiography.</b> For the indirect radiographic process, only one element, holmium, {{was found to be}} better than copper. Iron was also found to work as well as copper. All other elements that were tested were inferior to copper for indirect fast neutron <b>radiography.</b> For <b>direct</b> fast neutron <b>radiography,</b> the results were markedly different. Copper was found to be a poor material to sue, as thirty-two of the elements performed better than the copper. Tantalum was found to be the best material to use. Several other materials that also performed remarkably well include, in order of decreasing utility, gold, lutetium, germanium, dysprosium, and thulium. Several interesting results were obtained for the commercial X-ray scintillator screens. Most notably, useful radiographs were produced with all of the various scintillation screens. However, the screens containing YTaO{sub 4 }:Nb offered the greatest film densities for the shortest exposure times. Screens using GdSO{sub 4 }:Tb provided the best resolution and clearest images at the sacrifice of exposure time. Also, as previous researchers found, scintillator screens offered significantly shorter exposure times than activation foils...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{proposes that}} an increased source to the image-receptor distance (SID) technique {{can be used}} to optimize occipital frontal and lateral cranial radiographs acquired with <b>direct</b> digital <b>radiography.</b> Although cranial radiography is not performed on a routine basis, it should nonetheless be optimized to keep the dose to the patient as low as reasonably achievable, particularly because it can form part of the facial bone and sinus series. Dose measurements were acquired at various SIDs, and image quality was assessed using visual grading analysis. Statistically significant reductions in the effective dose between 19. 2 % and 23. 9 % were obtained when the SID was increased from the standard 100 to 150 cm (P ???. 05), and visual grading analysis scores indicate that image quality remained diagnostically acceptable for both projections. This investigation concludes that increasing the SID effectively optimizes occipital frontal and lateral skull radiographs. Radiology departments must be advised of the benefits of this technique with the goal of introducing an updated reference SID of 150 cm into clinical practice. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.
