40|$|With discretized {{particle}} velocity space, a unified gas-kinetic scheme for entire Knudsen number flows is constructed {{based on the}} BGK model. In comparison with many existing kinetic schemes for the Boltzmann equation, the current method has no difficulty to get accurate solution in the continuum flow regime, such as {{the solution of the}} Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with the time step being much larger than the particle collision time, and the rarefied flow solution, even for the <b>free</b> <b>molecule</b> <b>flow.</b> The unified scheme is an extension of the gas-kinetic BGK-NS scheme from the continuum flow to the rarefied regime with the discretization of {{particle velocity}} space. The success of the method is due to the un-splitting treatment for the particle transport and collision in the evaluation of local solution of the gas distribution function. For these methods which use operator splitting technique to solve the transport and collision separately, it is usually required that the time step is less than the particle collision time, which basically makes these methods useless in the continuum flow regime, especially in the high Reynolds cases. Theoretically, once the physical process of particle transport and collision is modeled statistically by the gas-kinetic Boltzmann equation, the transport and collision become continuous operators in space and time, and their numerical discretization should be done consistently. With the use of the integral solution of the BGK, the unified scheme can simulate the flow accurately in the whole flow regime from the continuum Navier-Stokes solutions to the <b>free</b> <b>molecule</b> <b>flow.</b> At the same time, the time step in the high Reynolds number continuum flow region is only determined by the CFL condition of the macroscopic equations, instead of particle collision time.

In this paper a new kernel is introduced, exploiting a purely mathematical method already known [1], but never used until recently [3]. This approach is useful for reformulating rigorously, in the frame of the scheme of the scattering kernel theory, reemission models which approximate satisfactorily the experimental results while do not satisfy the fundamental properties of the scattering kernels. An example is the boundary condition introduced many years ago by Nocilla [4], which assumes as distribution function for re-emitted molecules a "shifted Maxwellian". 2 The [...] ...|$|E
