50|$|A <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> is a {{connection}} between two bodies that imposes constraints on their relative movement.

50|$|Simple {{machines}} are elementary examples of kinematic chains {{that are used}} to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> called a helical joint.|$|E
50|$|Reuleaux {{believed}} that machines could be abstracted into chains of elementary links called kinematic pairs. Constraints {{on the machine}} are described by constraints on each <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair,</b> and the sequence of movements of pairs produces a kinematic chain.|$|E
40|$|The {{generalized}} deployable {{mechanism is}} composed of generalized links and generalized <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs.</b> The generalized links include the flexible members, springs, and cables etc. The generalized <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> include the preloaded <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> and flexible hinges etc. The generalized deployable mechanism consists of generalized deployable units. Based on group theory, this paper presents a brief and effective configuration synthesis method for generalized deployable units which {{is composed of}} generalized links and generalized <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> expressed by group. The permutation group is used to obtain all the permutation types of generalized <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> and generalized links. The configuration matrix of generalized deployable unit is established through combining permutation group, and the topological configurations of generalized deployable units are created. The combining rules of groups are developed. The method of isomorphism detection is used to ensure the uniqueness of configurations. The configurations of generalized deployable units including four and six generalized links are generated respectively...|$|R

5000|$|A {{screw joint}} is a one-degree-of-freedom <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> used in mechanisms. [...] Screw joints provide {{single-axis}} translation by utilizing the threads of the threaded rod {{to provide such}} translation. This type of joint is used primarily on most types of linear actuators and certain types of cartesian robots.|$|E

(They do not allow translation, or sliding linear motion, a constraint not shown in the diagram.) ...|$|E
50|$|Mathematical {{models of}} the connections, or joints, between two links are termed <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs.</b> <b>Kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> model the hinged and sliding joints {{fundamental}} to robotics, often called lower pairs and the surface contact joints critical to cams and gearing, called higher pairs. These joints are generally modeled as holonomic constraints. A kinematic diagram is a schematic of the mechanical system that shows the kinematic chain.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} use {{geometry}} {{to study the}} movement of a mechanism, its links are modeled as rigid bodies. This means distances between points in a link {{are assumed to be}} unchanged as the mechanism moves, that is the link does not flex. Thus, the relative movement between points in two connected links is considered to result from the <b>kinematic</b> <b>pair</b> that joins them.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{method for}} mobility analysis of mechanisms {{is presented in}} this article, {{which is based on}} the screw theory and the topology structure of mechanisms. The proposed method can be summarized as one core principle and two key techniques. The core principle is that the series connection of <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> is equivalent to the superposition of corresponding degrees of freedom, and the parallel connection of <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs</b> is equivalent to the superposition of corresponding constraints. The first key technique for analyzing the mobility of mechanisms is to correctly identify the series and parallel connection relationship between all <b>kinematic</b> <b>pairs,</b> that is, the mechanism topology structure. Another key technique is transforming the screws and reciprocal screws from local coordinate systems to the global coordinate system. First, the above-mentioned method is presented in theory.

A comparative analysis reveals angular velocity, acceleration {{change and the}} loading conditions of the input and output components. Joggle force between Crankshaft and cycloidal wheel are also analysized. It is a convenient way for stiffness design of 2 K-V reducer.
