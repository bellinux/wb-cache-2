5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> take a great leap with him." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make him save the world instead. He described it as a comedy of a man whose day keeps getting worse and worse. Believing that London and companions from London had become a cliché and the audience had become bored with it, Moffat set the episode in the fictional village of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, debated whether to locate the episode in a village in Scotland. He ultimately decided on England, in keeping with the notion of Amelia as an unconventional girl.|$|E

500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up...

500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all just thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|E

[...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I {{think if you look}} at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going."

500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us think that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E
