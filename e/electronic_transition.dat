25|$|The {{distribution}} of intensity between the zero-phonon {{line and the}} phonon side band {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. At room temperature there is enough thermal energy to excite many phonons and the probability of zero-phonon transition is close to zero. For organic chromophores in organic matrices, the probability of a zero-phonon <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> only becomes likely below about 40 kelvins, but depends also on the strength of coupling between the chromophore and the host lattice.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Franck–Condon principle, after the <b>electronic</b> <b>transition,</b> the molecules which {{end up in}} higher vibrational states immediately begin to relax to the lowest vibrational state. In the case of solvation, the solvent molecules will immediately try to rearrange themselves {{in order to minimize}} the interaction energy. The rate of solvent relaxation depends on the viscosity of the solvent. Assuming the solvent relaxation time is short compared with the lifetime of the electronic excited state, emission will be from the lowest solvent energy state of the excited electronic state. For small-molecule solvents such as water or methanol at ambient temperature, solvent relaxation time is on the order of some tens of picoseconds whereas chromophore excited state lifetimes range from a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Immediately after the transition to the ground electronic state, the solvent molecules must also rearrange themselves to accommodate the new electronic configuration of the chromophore. Figure 7 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle applied to solvation. When the solution is illuminated by with light corresponding to the <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> energy, some of the chromophores will move to the excited state. Within this group of chromophores there will be a statistical distribution of solvent-chromophore interaction energies, represented in the figure by a Gaussian distribution function. The solvent-chromophore interaction is drawn as a parabolic potential in both electronic states. Since the <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> is essentially instantaneous on the time scale of solvent motion (vertical arrow), the collection of excited state chromophores is immediately far from equilibrium. The rearrangement of the solvent molecules according to the new potential energy curve is represented by the curved arrows in Figure 7. Note that while the electronic transitions are quantized, the chromophore-solvent interaction energy is treated as a classical continuum due to the large number of molecules involved. Although emission is depicted as taking place from the minimum of the excited state chromophore-solvent interaction potential, significant emission can take place before equilibrium is reached when the viscosity of the solvent is high or the lifetime of the excited state is short. The energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons depicted in Figure 7 is the solvation contribution to the Stokes shift.|$|E
25|$|The Franck–Condon principle, in its {{canonical}} form, {{applies only}} {{to changes in the}} vibrational levels of a molecule {{in the course of a}} change in electronic levels by either absorption or emission of a photon. The physical intuition of this principle is anchored by the idea that the nuclear coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecule do not have time to change during the very brief amount of time involved in an <b>electronic</b> <b>transition.</b> However, this physical intuition can be, and is indeed, routinely extended to interactions between light-absorbing or emitting molecules (chromophores) and their environment. Franck–Condon metaphors are appropriate because molecules often interact strongly with surrounding molecules, particularly in liquids and solids, and these interactions modify the nuclear coordinates of the chromophore in ways closely analogous to the molecular vibrations considered by the Franck–Condon principle.|$|E

2500|$|The closest Franck–Condon {{analogy is}} due to the {{interaction}} of phonons (quanta of lattice vibrations) with the electronic transitions of chromophores embedded as impurities in the lattice. In this situation, transitions to higher electronic levels can take place when the energy of the photon corresponds to the purely <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> energy or to the purely <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> energy plus the energy of one or more lattice phonons. In the low-temperature approximation, emission is from the zero-phonon level of the excited state [...] to the zero-phonon level of the ground state or to higher phonon levels of the ground state. Just like in the Franck–Condon principle, the probability of transitions involving phonons is determined by the overlap of the phonon wavefunctions at the initial and final energy levels. For the Franck–Condon principle applied to phonon transitions, the label of the horizontal axis of Figure 1 is replaced in Figure 6 with the configurational coordinate for a normal mode. The lattice mode [...] potential energy in Figure 6 is represented as that of a harmonic oscillator, and the spacing between phonon levels (...) is determined by lattice parameters. Because the energy of single phonons is generally quite small, zero- or few-phonon transitions can only be observed at temperatures below about 40 kelvins.|$|E

2500|$|The zero-phonon {{line and}} the phonon {{sideband}} jointly constitute the line shape of individual light absorbing and emitting molecules (chromophores) embedded into a transparent solid matrix. When the host matrix contains many chromophores, each will contribute a zero-phonon line and a phonon sideband to the absorption and emission spectra. [...] The spectra originating from a collection of identical chromophores in a matrix {{is said to be}} inhomogeneously broadened because each chromophore is surrounded by a somewhat different matrix environment which modifies the energy required for an <b>electronic</b> <b>transition.</b> In an inhomogeneous distribution of chromophores, individual zero-phonon line and phonon sideband positions are therefore shifted and overlapping.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transition}} between {{the ground and}} the excited state is based on the Franck–Condon principle, that the <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> is very fast compared with the motion in the lattice. The energy transitions can then be symbolized by vertical arrows between the ground and excited state, that is, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates during the transition. Figure 2 is an energy diagram for interpreting absorption and emission with and without phonons in terms of the configurational coordinate qi. The energy transitions originate at the lowest phonon energy level of the electronic states. As represented in the figure, the largest wavefunction overlap (and therefore largest transition probability) occurs when the photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the two electronic states (E1 – E0) plus three quanta of lattice mode i vibrational energy (...) [...] This three-phonon transition is mirrored in emission when the excited state quickly decays to its zero-point lattice vibration level by means of a radiationless process, and from there to the ground state via photon emission. The zero-phonon transition is depicted as having a lower wavefunction overlap and therefore a lower transition probability.|$|E
2500|$|From spectra with {{rotational}} resolution, {{moments of}} inertia and hence bond lengths and angles {{can be determined}} [...] "directly" [...] (at least in principle). From less well-resolved spectra one can still determine important quantities like JT stabilization energies and energy barriers (e.g. to pseudorotation). However, in the whole spectral intensity distribution [...] of an <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> more information is encoded. It {{has been used to}} decide on the presence (or absence) of the geometric phase which is accumulated during the pseudorotational motion around the JT (or other type of) conical intersection. Prominent examples of either type are the ground (X) or an excited (B) state of Na3. The Fourier transform of , the so-called autocorrelation function [...] reflects the motion of the wavepacket after an optical (= vertical) transition to the APES of the final electronic state. Typically it will move on the timescale of a vibrational period which is (for small molecules) of the order of 5-50 fs, i.e. ultrafast. Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.|$|E
2500|$|Consider chromophores {{surrounded}} by solvent molecules. These surrounding molecules may {{interact with the}} chromophores, particularly if the solvent molecules are polar. This association between solvent and solute {{is referred to as}} solvation and is a stabilizing interaction, that is, the solvent molecules can move and rotate until the energy of the interaction is minimized. The interaction itself involves electrostatic and van der Waals forces and can also include hydrogen bonds. Franck–Condon principles can be applied when the interactions between the chromophore and the surrounding solvent molecules are different in the ground and in the excited electronic state. This change in interaction can originate, for example, due to different dipole moments in these two states. If the chromophore starts in its ground state and is close to equilibrium with the surrounding solvent molecules and then absorbs a photon that takes it to the excited state, its interaction with the solvent will be far from equilibrium in the excited state. This effect is analogous to the original Franck–Condon principle: the <b>electronic</b> <b>transition</b> is very fast compared with the motion of nuclei—the rearrangement of solvent molecules in the case of solvation. We now speak of a vertical transition, but now the horizontal coordinate is solvent-solute interaction space. This coordinate axis is often labeled as [...] "Solvation Coordinate" [...] and represents, somewhat abstractly, all of the relevant dimensions of motion of all of the interacting solvent molecules.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{spectra of}} a number of platinum (II) complexes bound to single nucleobases have been investigated using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT). The calculated spectra obtained in this work have been benchmarked against recent gas-phase photo-dissociation spectra of platinum complex-nucleobase clusters. UV spectra have been calculated for a range of density functionals and basis sets to determine the best functional-basis set combination for reproducing the experimental spectra. The first series of TDDFT calculations conducted in this work investigated the <b>electronic</b> <b>transitions</b> of iodide ion-nucleobase clusters and their constituent “monomer” parts (i. e. the isolated iodide anion and isolated nucleobases). Calculations on the I-∙Nu clusters (Nu = Uracil, Thymine or Adenine) and isolated uracil, cytosine, thymine and adenine produced computed UV spectra and the associated <b>electronic</b> <b>transitions</b> were characterised by inspection of respective molecular orbitals.
