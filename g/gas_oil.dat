The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with <b>gas,</b> <b>oil,</b> and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} pressure {{to satisfy the}} environmental criteria concerning oil products leads {{to the need for}} developing accurate models to predict the performances of the refining processes. In the current study, a stochastic two-step procedure using Monte Carlo techniques is applied to and validated on the hydrotreating of Light Cycle <b>Oil</b> (LCO) <b>gas</b> <b>oils.</b> In the first step, a mixture of molecules representative of the LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> is generated using a molecular econstruction method termed SR-REM. Subsequently, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) is applied to simulate the evolution of the mixture composition during hydrotreating. The results show that an accurate representation of eleven different LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> was obtained by the application of the molecular reconstruction method. The hydrotreating simulations of three LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> at different operating conditions showed a good agreement with the experimental data obtained at laboratory scale.

30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> in foamy <b>oil,</b> saturated oil, and dead oil {{at the same}} pressure indicates that diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> in foamy <b>oil</b> are lower than that of <b>gas</b> in saturated <b>oil</b> and dead oil. For example, the diffusion coefficients of natural <b>gas</b> in dead <b>oil</b> are 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of <b>gas</b> in saturated <b>oil</b> and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa. This is the reason why the cumulative diffusion volume of <b>gas</b> in dead <b>oil</b> is larger than that of <b>gas</b> in saturated <b>oil</b> and foamy oil.|$|R

25|$|Dry ice {{is easily}} manufactured.) Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26}} First, gases {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural <b>gas,</b> <b>oil</b> refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{resources}} of the Rocky Mountains are varied and abundant. Minerals found in the Rocky Mountains include significant deposits of copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, silver, tungsten, and zinc. The Wyoming Basin and several smaller areas contain significant reserves of coal, natural <b>gas,</b> <b>oil</b> shale, and petroleum. For example, the Climax mine, located near Leadville, Colorado, was the largest producer of molybdenum in the world. Molybdenum is used in heat-resistant steel in such things as cars and planes. The Climax mine employed over 3,000 workers. The Coeur d'Alene mine of northern Idaho produces silver, lead, and zinc. Canada's largest coal mines are near Fernie, British Columbia and Sparwood, British Columbia; additional coal mines exist near Hinton, Alberta, and in the Northern Rockies surrounding Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.|$|E

The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all <b>gas,</b> <b>oil</b> and forced hot water systems).

25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, fluid catalytic cracking was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> and coke, and more sophisticated forms of thermal cracking have been developed for various purposes. These include visbreaking, steam cracking, and coking.|$|E
25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, <b>gas,</b> <b>oil)</b> mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.|$|E
