25|$|Titin {{is a large}} {{abundant}} protein of striated muscle. Titin's primary {{functions are}} to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the sarcomere, and to recoil the sarcomere like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half {{the length of a}} sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the <b>I-band,</b> the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the <b>I-band</b> region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.|$|E

In the 1950s and 60s, in order to obtain high quality images of celestial objects in the very near infrared part of the spectrum (the <b>I-band,</b> 680–880nm), he used chemically hyper-sensitized standard Eastman emulsions I-N. To achieve the hyper-sensitization he immersed them in 5% ammonia solution for 3–5 minutes. This procedure increased their sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Between 1957 and 1967 Maffei observed many different objects using this technique, including globular clusters and planetary nebulae. Some of those objects were not visible at all on blue light (250–500nm) sensitive plates.|$|E

40|$|The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) {{instrument}} onboard the Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite {{was launched}} on 28 October 2011. The VIIRS has 5 imagery spectral bands (<b>I-bands),</b> 16 moderate resolution spectral bands (M-bands) and a panchromatic day/night band (DNB). Performance of the VIIRS spatial response and band-to-band co-registration (BBR) was measured through intensive pre-launch tests. These measurements {{were made in}} the non-aggregated zones near the start (or end) of scan for the <b>I-bands</b> and M-bands and for a limited number of aggregation modes for the DNB in order to test requirement compliance. This paper presents results based on a recently re-processed pre-launch test data. Sensor (detector) spatial impulse responses in the scan direction are parameterized in terms of ground dynamic field of view (GDFOV), horizontal spatial resolution (HSR), modulation transfer function (MTF), ensquared energy (EE) and integrated out-of-pixel (IOOP) spatial response. Results are presented for the non-aggregation, 2 -sample and 3 -sample aggregation zones for the <b>I-bands</b> and M-bands, and for a limited number of aggregation modes for the DNB. On-orbit GDFOVs measured for the 5 <b>I-bands</b> in the scan direction using a straight bridge are also presented. Band-to-band co-registration (BBR) is quantified using the prelaunch measured band-to-band offsets. These offsets may be expressed as fractions of horizontal sampling intervals (HSIs), detector spatial response parameters GDFOV or HSR. BBR bases on HSIs in the non-aggregation, 2 -sample and 3 -sample aggregation zones are presented. BBR matrices based on scan direction GDFOV and HSR are compared to the BBR matrix based on HSI in the non-aggregation zone. We demonstrate that BBR based on GDFOV is a better representation of footprint overlap and so this definition should be used in BBR requirement specifications. We propose that HSR not be used as the primary image quality indicator, since we show that it is neither an adequate representation of the size of sensor spatial response nor an adequate measure of imaging quality...|$|R

End-fragments are rarely, if ever, present in similarly stretched and skinned, but unstimulated fibers, although fine "gap filaments" persist. Negatively stained thick filaments, separated from skinned, calcium-activated, fiber bundles, allowed to shorten freely, are significantly shorter than those obtained from unstimulated fibers, but are identical to the latter with respect to both the surface helical array of myosin heads and diameters. Many end-fragments are present on grids containing thick filaments from activated fibers; few, if any, on those from unstimulated fibers. SDS-PAGE shows no evidence of proteolysis due to activation and demonstrates the presence of polypeptides with very high molecular weights in the preparations. We suggest that thick filament shortening {{is a direct result of}} activation in Limulus telson muscle and that it occurs largely by breakage within a defined distal region of each polar half of the filament. It is possible that at least some of the fine "gap filaments" are composed of a titin-like protein. They may move the activation- produced, fragmented ends of thick filaments to which they attach, into the <b>I-bands</b> by elastic recoil, in highly stretched fibers...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a mathematical description of the equilibrium (Donnan) distribution of mobile ions between two phases containing fixed charges. This differs from the classical Donnan derivation by including mobile polyvalent ions such as those present in intact muscle fibers and in solutions used with skinned muscle fibers. Given the average concentrations of ionic species present in intact frog muscle, we calculate that the myofibrillar fixed charge density (- 42 meq/liter cytoplasmic fluid) is {{in close agreement with}} estimates from amino acid analysis of myofibrillar proteins. As expected, with negative fixed charges in the myofibril, anions are excluded from the myofibrillar space while cations are concentrated in this space; the ratio between the average intra- and extramyofibrillar concentrations for an ion of valence n is (1. 11) n. This model allowed us to design a bathing solution for skinned muscle fibers in which the intramyofibrillar ion concentrations closely approximate those found in intact frog muscle cells. Our model, applied to the A- and <b>I-bands</b> of the sarcomere, suggests that likely differences in fixed charge densities in these regions accounts for {{only a small fraction of}} the extreme concentration of phosphocreatine observed in the <b>I-bands</b> of intact frog muscle...|$|R
