40|$|Abstract─A {{vehicular}} network {{must ensure}} a trust relationship among participating “smart vehicles ” (vehicles installed with wireless network devices) and roadside infrastructure {{in order to}} maximize the benefit provided by the network. In this paper, we present practical ways to provide reliable reputation scores for vehicles in a vehicular network. Because in most of the time, the majority of people drive their vehicles locally for their daily commute (to work places, schools, daycares, superstores, etc), most vehicles have their predefined constant daily trajectories. Based on this phenomenon, roadside infrastructure could rely on repeated daily observations of the same set of passing-by vehicles to build long-term reputation scores for these local “community” vehicles, in the similar way as the reputation built-up for people in a club or a church community. The proposed scheme does not require sufficient density of smart vehicles and only requires each smart vehicle has one secret and verifiable certificate. These features make it especially suitable for the initial <b>deployment</b> <b>stage</b> of vehicular network when the penetration rate of smart vehicles is very low and vehicle-based public-key infrastructure is not mature.

Towards this goal we introduce {{the notion of the}} "self-growing network". The latter, in its initial <b>deployment</b> <b>stage,</b> is limited to a single dedicated purpose (energy-efficient networking, spectrum efficient communications, control and surveillance use, etc) but can evolve/grow into a multi-purpose, versatile infrastructure, that serves a broader range of applications by utilising combinations of self-x and cooperating features...|$|E

All the sensor nodes are identical, having fixed positions distributed uniformly over an area. Each sensor node is able to determine its position (geographical position or relative coordination in the concerned area) and the position of the BS during the <b>deployment</b> <b>stage.</b> Signals received from the target have the same original strength, which is known to the sensor. Sensors can estimate the distance to the target based on signal attenuation with some degree of error.|$|E

However, especially in the early <b>deployment</b> <b>stages</b> of VANETs, the coverage of RSUs will not be complete due to the high costs for planning, deploying, and maintaining an ubiquitous roadside infrastructure.|$|R

The approach is relying on the modularity of the platform architecture. The interfaces are different at the design, at run-time and at <b>deployment</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} this paper was put on the <b>deployment</b> <b>stage</b> in which the variety of {{interfaces}} has the highest impact. We proposed to use Vendor modules to make the connection with the particular services which are following a given pattern in their description. Such modules are integrable in the broker system that was reported earlier. Moreover we proposed a pattern for describing the Cloud resource and the Cloud application that is compatible with current emerging standards, as proved by the proof-of-concept editor for application and resource description, shortly described in this paper.|$|E

30|$|Performance {{evaluation}} is conducted using a simulator written in C++. The simulator is event-driven and models real-life {{events such as}} carrier sense, backoff, and packet collisions. When the simulation starts, nodes are randomly placed in the simulation area. The sink node is placed at the center. Once deployed, nodes exchange messages {{with each other to}} gain information necessary for routing. (e.g., tree-based protocols need to know the hop distance of each node from the sink, opportunistic protocols need to compute EDC and forwarder sets). The overhead of exchanging messages at this stage is not included in the total energy consumption, since it is assumed to be done once at the <b>deployment</b> <b>stage,</b> or rarely done during operation.|$|E

The propagation model is an important function in cellular radio system design. For better network coverage, the propagation parameters that influence the received signal strength must therefore be optimised and in turn verified by in-situ measurements after deployment. In this paper, we report on drive-tests to measure the received power from a pilot in a CDMA 2000 mobile cellular network in Greater Accra, Ghana. By using the least-square algorithm to fit the Hata-Okumura prediction, the resulting model was found to agree well with the measured data...|$|E

A drag chute would have been released {{from the rear of}} the X-38. This drag chute would have been used to stabilize and slow the vehicle down. The parafoil (area of 687 square meters) was then released. It would open in five steps (a process called staging). While the staging process only takes 45 seconds, it is important for a successful chute <b>deployment.</b> <b>Staging</b> prevents high-speed winds from tearing the parafoil.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a practical liner ship fleet deployment problem with week-dependent container shipment demand and transit time constraint, namely, maximum allowable transit time in container routing between {{a pair of}} ports. It first uses the space–time network approach to generate practical container routes subject to the transit time constraints. This paper proceeds to formulate the fleet deployment problem based on the practical container routes generated. In view of the intractability of the formulation, two relaxation models providing lower bounds are built: one requires known container shipment demand at the fleet <b>deployment</b> <b>stage,</b> and the other assumes constant container shipment demand over the planning horizon. An efficient global optimization algorithm is subsequently proposed.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) with hierarchical {{organizations have}} recently attracted {{a lot of}} attention as effective platforms for pervasive computing. With power efficiency and lifetime awareness becoming critical design concerns, a significant amount of research has focused on energy-aware design of different layers of the WSN protocol stack. However, much less has been done in way of incorporating physical layer characteristics at the system <b>deployment</b> <b>stage</b> and analyzing the effects on spatial energy balancing across the network and the resulting overall network lifetime. Our focus is on improving the lifetime of each cluster of sensors in a hierarchical WSN using optimization techniques at the physical layer. Specifically, we study how the location-aware selection of the modulation schemes for sensors can affect their energy efficiency. Furthermore, we show how the energy in the network can be distributed more evenly by proper selection of the modulation schemes for different sensors...|$|E

The proposed approach targets the initial <b>deployment</b> <b>stage</b> of VANET when basic roadside unit (RSU) support infrastructure is available and {{a small fraction of}} vehicles have network communication capability. Unlike previously proposed schemes that require a dedicated vehicular public key infrastructure to certify individual vehicles, in our approach RSUs are the only components issuing the certificates. Due to the differences of moving dynamics among vehicles, it is rare to have two vehicles passing by multiple RSUs at exactly the same time. By exploiting this spatial and temporal correlation between vehicles and RSUs, two messages will be treated as Sybil attack issued by one vehicle if they have the similar timestamp series issued by RSUs. The timestamp series approach needs neither vehicular-based public-key infrastructure nor Internet accessible RSUs, which makes it an economical solution suitable for the initial stage of VANET. 1...|$|E
