40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the {{classical}} demand in the “Groundwork” that an action to have moral worth has to be done from duty and not merely done in conformity with duty. I will be arguing that the main reason for this requirement is the reliability of producing the right action, and in order to show this I will put forward the example of what I call “the incorruptible ideal moral agent”.  I will also suggest that the moral attitude required by Kant rather than being a puritanical view that undermines <b>fellow</b> <b>feelings</b> as moral motives to action, has an educative purpose and indicates the importance to adhere to a concept of reason in practical affairs that sharply challenges some practices and principles that are in vogue nowadays. </div...|$|E
40|$|Nationalism {{during the}} early 20 th century, was often shaped around efforts to create {{feelings}} of fellowship within the frontiers. <b>Fellow</b> <b>feelings</b> was considered as a necessity to convince the people that their efforts served mutual goals. Beginning in the 19 th century, the European nations experienced a great many projects for this purpose. In the early 20 th century the efforts grew. The danger {{of war and the}} competition for economic power, contributed the increase of nationalist movements. At the same time, many influential intellectuals also expressed apprehensions about the urbanized way of life; measures were necessary to secure the future success of the nation. The national movements in Sweden, played a prominent role {{in the creation of a}} greater patriotic feeling. This paper is about one of these movements: Swedish Tourist Association (STF), founded in 1885. Around the motto “Know your country”, STF promoted Swedish tourism aiming to spread knowledge of the country and its people. Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities and Michel Foucault’s Discipline & Punish has influenced the interpretation of STF’s yearbooks 1908 - 1916. This paper aims at explaining STF’s activities as a combination of efforts to create <b>fellow</b> <b>feelings</b> among the Swedes, and efforts to discipline them to a healthier way of life. STF’s vision was to construct mutual heartfelt emotions towards the Swedish nature. The sound nature was seen as a symbol for the sound nation. It was thereby desirable that the Swedes were given the opportunity to experience this nature. Tourism became a technique to solve both the need for Swedish fellowship and the need for healthy citizens. Tourism placed the Swedish bodies in the Swedish nature, which disciplined them to mutual patriotic feellings for their beautiful country, and at the same time gave them the healthy constitution and moral strength that should characterize every Swede...|$|E
40|$|Woman in Motran's poem -Abstract This article {{explains}} {{the issue of}} woman in two fields of social and romance. In social case, Motran defends the rights of woman and considers her as a human with its rights {{and one of the}} two major factors in the society. Woman is a basic and essential party in building the social and even political body of the society, at Motran's point of view. The woman in his explanation, encourages the man for the revolution against the cruel governments or enters the politics to defend the oppressed's rights. In Romantic explanation of the woman, Motran doesn't introduce the woman as a carnal object and respects her with eminent human characters. In Motran's romantic poems, woman is enormous in sensations and <b>fellow</b> <b>feelings.</b> In explaining the subject of woman, his genre is romanticism that proposes the highest emotions and senses of the poet. Sometimes he uses the story poems to imply the romance. He uses this method even to explain the social and political subject to increase the influence...|$|E

Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose V to express <b>fellow</b> <b>feeling</b> with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use V to his favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use T. For example, a child might use T to express affection for his or her parent.|$|R

The scout groups of St. Joseph have participated in numerous camps, rallies, jamborees at home and abroad. Many of the scouts have camped in countries like Australia, India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

[...] She had, indeed, studied hard, but that she had always done, as being clever, intellectual and ambitious. The difference had been from her intercourse with persons slightly her elders, but who did not look on authorities as natural enemies, to be tolerated for one's own good. There had been a development of the conscience and soul even in this first term that made her regard her elder sister not merely with a sense of compulsory gratitude and duty, but with sympathy and <b>fellow</b> <b>feeling,</b> which were the more excited when she saw her own chilliness of last spring carried further by the two young girls.|$|R
2500|$|A {{benefit of}} tracing good to {{pleasure}} and pain {{is that both}} are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may {{come in the form}} of empathy—the ability of a being to [...] "feel" [...] another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the ethical relationship view and has given rise to the animal rights movement and parts of the peace movement. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with Enlightenment views, including David Hume's stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and <b>fellow</b> <b>feeling</b> for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments.|$|R
