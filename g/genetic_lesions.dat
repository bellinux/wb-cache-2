40|$|Abstract Background Many cancer {{clinical}} trials now specify the particular {{status of a}} <b>genetic</b> <b>lesion</b> in a patient's tumor in the inclusion or exclusion criteria for trial enrollment. To facilitate search and identification of gene-associated {{clinical trials}} by potential participants and clinicians, {{it is important to}} develop automated methods to identify genetic information from narrative trial documents. Methods We developed a two-stage classification method to identify genes and <b>genetic</b> <b>lesion</b> statuses in clinical trial documents extracted from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Physician Data Query (PDQ) cancer clinical trial database. The method consists of two steps: 1) to distinguish gene entities from non-gene entities such as English words; and 2) to determine whether and which <b>genetic</b> <b>lesion</b> status is associated with an identified gene entity. We developed and evaluated the performance of the method using a manually annotated data set containing 1, 143 instances of the eight most frequently mentioned genes in cancer clinical trials. In addition, we applied the classifier to a real-world task of cancer trial annotation and evaluated its performance using a larger sample size (4, 013 instances from 249 distinct human gene symbols detected from 250 trials). Results Our evaluation using a manually annotated data set showed that the two-stage classifier outperformed the single-stage classifier and achieved the best average accuracy of 83. 7 % for the eight most frequently mentioned genes when optimized feature sets were used. It also showed better generalizability when we applied the two-stage classifier trained on one set of genes to another independent gene. When a gene-neutral, two-stage classifier was applied to the real-world task of cancer trial annotation, it achieved a highest accuracy of 89. 8 %, demonstrating the feasibility of developing a gene-neutral classifier for this task. Conclusions We presented a machine learning-based approach to detect gene entities and the <b>genetic</b> <b>lesion</b> statuses from clinical trial documents and demonstrated its use in cancer trial annotation. Such methods would be valuable for building information retrieval tools targeting gene-associated clinical trials. </p...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} <b>genetic</b> <b>lesions</b> associated with rhabdomyosarcoma, {{but there has}} been little consistent data demonstrating an association between specific genetic abnormalities and outcome. However, alveolar and embryonal types of RMS can be distinguished cytogenetically, and identification of specific <b>genetic</b> <b>lesions</b> can allow for accurate classification of the ARMS subtype when the histopathological findings are equivocal or unclear. This is valuable for clinical practice as the alveolar type presents a higher risk to the patient and will often require more aggressive treatment than the embryonal type. Up to 90% of alveolar RMS cases present with a translocations of t(2;13)(q35,q14) or, less commonly, t(1;13)(p36,q15). Both involve the translocation of a DNA binding domain of PAX, a member of the Paired Box family of transcription factors, to a transactivation site on FKHR, a member of the forkhead/HNF-3 transcription factor family. The t(2;13) translocation results in a fusion of the PAX3 gene with FKHR, while the t(1;13) translocation involves the fusion of PAX7 with FKHR. PAX3 has a demonstrated role in muscle cell development, which supports its potential role in RMS. The t(2;13) translocation can result in the PAX3-FKHR fusion product, which is indicative of classic cystic ARMS. [...] Cases of ARMS presenting with this fusion protein are said to be fusion-positive and are associated with a poorer prognosis than fusion-negative ARMS. Fortunately, the fusion protein presents a potential therapeutic target, but {{more research is needed to}} clarify the role of PAX3-FKHR in ARMS.|$|E

5000|$|The MRN complex {{has also}} been implicated in several {{pathways}} contributing to the insensitivity of cancer stem cells to the DNA damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which {{is a source of}} overall tumor aggression. Specifically, the MRN inhibitor Mirin (inhibiting MRE11) has been shown to disrupt the ability of ATM kinase to control the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint, which is required for repair of double-strand DNA breaks. [...] The loss of this checkpoint strips cancer stem cells' ability to repair lethal <b>genetic</b> <b>lesions,</b> making them vulnerable to DNA damaging therapeutic agents. Likewise, overexpression of Nbs1 in HNSCC cells has been correlated with increased activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which itself has been shown to contribute to tumor aggression by reducing apoptosis.
