5|$|After {{structural}} <b>design</b> <b>on</b> alternate {{body styles}} encountered obstacles, Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with entry level models priced at $1850, undercutting GM's Chevrolet Vega and directly targeting imported models — which included such new competitors as the Mazda 1200 in 1971, the Subaru DL in 1972, and the Honda Civic in 1973.|$|E
40|$|This conference paper {{examines}} experimental <b>design</b> exercises <b>on</b> {{a simulated}} model {{in relation to}} <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> a physical model. In the initial design phases, the process of <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> both a haptic and digital model is analysed {{with regard to the}} didactic objectives. In this context, only form-related aesthetic aspects are discussed. The starting point is the didactic necessity of imparting to students the process of <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> spatial models. Reduced to form determination, the question examined is for which aspects of design theory the potentials of real and virtual models, {{as well as of the}} interaction of both types, can be exploited...|$|R

5|$|The Treasury {{announced}} the new <b>design</b> <b>on</b> December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written {{descriptions of the}} designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the <b>design</b> <b>on</b> December 20. As {{it would take the}} Mint several days to produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29.|$|E
5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level {{intercity}} railroad passenger cars built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet <b>design</b> <b>on</b> its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for long-distance service. They were the last intercity passenger cars built by Budd.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 32,400 coins {{on which}} Morgan {{had tried to}} keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were {{believed}} to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist. The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief <b>design</b> <b>on</b> February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84million pieces in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Both {{carriers}} will {{be completed}} as originally planned, in a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configuration, deploying the Lockheed Martin F-35B. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the British government had intended to purchase the F-35C carrier version of this aircraft, and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government {{announced that it would}} revert to the original <b>design</b> <b>on</b> 10 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was so fierce that it involved last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage. Metro-Cammell, Kawasaki and ASEA were shortlisted for the final round. Metro-Cammell based its <b>design</b> <b>on</b> the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won {{the contract}}. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E

5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the <b>design</b> <b>on</b> his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Detailed <b>design</b> <b>on</b> {{the first}} stage of the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would copy the airframe and offer the copied <b>design</b> <b>on</b> the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active electronically-scanned array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character <b>design</b> <b>on</b> {{the video game}} , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{requested}} industry {{proposals for}} a new seaplane to replace the Kingfisher and Curtiss SO3C Seamew. The new aircraft was required {{to be able to}} use landing gear as well as floats. Curtiss submitted a <b>design</b> <b>on</b> 1 August, and received a contract for two prototypes and five service-test aircraft on 25 August. The first flight of a prototype XSC-1 took place on 16 February 1944 at the Columbus, Ohio Curtiss plant. The first production aircraft were delivered in October 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 the single-seat Curtiss SC Seahawk floatplane began replacing the Kingfisher. Had the Montana class been completed, they would have arrived around the time of this replacement, and would likely have been equipped with the Seahawk for use in combat operations and seaborne search and rescue.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hosoda, the team included writer Satoko Okudera and character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who previously worked with Hosoda on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Hiroyuki Aoyama {{served as an}} animation director, while action animation direction was handled by Tatsuzo Nishida. During production, Sadamoto based Wabisuke's <b>design</b> <b>on</b> those of actor Yusaku Matsuda. Aoyama was responsible for supervising the animation {{of the real world}} scenes, while Nishida supervised the animation for the digital world, using both traditional animation and computer animation techniques. Digital animation studio Digital Frontier was responsible for creating the visuals of OZ and its avatars. Youji Takeshige oversaw the art direction for Summer Wars. While visiting Ueda, Hosoda thought that Takeshige, who has previously worked with Studio Ghibli, should draw traditional Japanese houses for the film. The film also features the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa, whose control center is located in the nearby city of Saku. Hosoda included the spacecraft to support Japan's contribution towards space exploration.|$|E
