5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable <b>individual</b> <b>identification.</b> This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

25|$|Captured {{birds are}} often marked for future recognition. Rings or bands provide {{long-lasting}} identification but require capture {{for the information}} on them to be read. Field identifiable marks such as coloured bands, wing tags or dyes enable short-term studies where <b>individual</b> <b>identification</b> is required.

25|$|The job of <b>individual</b> <b>identification</b> {{took many}} weeks, and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police.

Record keeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the coroner. From a purely technical point of view the exercise was both innovative and highly successful, with 83% of the deceased eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a print, or keys in a pocket.|$|E

2500|$|The term Irish {{diaspora}} {{is open to}} many interpretations. [...] The diaspora, broadly interpreted, {{contains all}} those known to have Irish ancestors, i.e., over 100 million people, {{which is more than}} fifteen times the population of the island of Ireland, which was about 6.4 million in 2011. It has been argued the idea of an Irish diaspora, as distinct from the old identification of Irishness with Ireland itself, was influenced by the perceived advent of global mobility and modernity. Irishness could now be identified with dispersed individuals and groups of Irish descent. But many of those individuals were the product of complex ethnic intermarriage in America and elsewhere, complicating the idea of a single line of descent. [...] "Irishness" [...] might then rely primarily on <b>individual</b> <b>identification</b> with an Irish diaspora.|$|E
