Using {{petroleum}} ether {{to extract the}} fermentative fluid (bio-slurry), then to get the inhibition mechanism of it, and infer which is the main component in inhibition mechanism of biogas. The conclusion found by the experiment is that fat soluble substance is better than water soluble substance in inhibition mechanism, and fat soluble substance is close to 75 % biogas <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid,</b> while water soluble substance is worst.

Differences between perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) could not be observed. Proportions of PFAAs recovered in the fermentation fluids decreased by increasing chain lengths for the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (31  % PFBS, 28  % perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS], 20  % perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid [PFHpS], 11  % PFOS) and PFCAs (33  % perfluorohexane carboxylic acid [PFHxA], 32  % perfluoroheptane carboxylic acid [PFHpA], 24  % perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA]). In contrast, levels in feed increased with increasing chain length for both PFSAs and PFCAs.|$|E

30|$|The two {{predominant}} bacteria of {{the skin}} health consortia included B. cereus and Oceanobacillus polygoni. B. cereus averaged 459.93 [*]±[*] 30.38 ‰ and O. polygoni 295.24 [*]±[*] 73.53 ‰ in the HG group. The population of both species dramatically dropped to 43.80 [*]±[*] 24.20 ‰ and 24.70 [*]±[*] 12.17 ‰, respectively, during the advanced stage of skin ulceration. B. cereus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic, motile, β-hemolytic bacterium that is commonly found in soil and food. Some strains of B. cereus are harmful, whereas others can be beneficial as probiotics for animals (Charalampopoulos and Rastall 2009). O. polygoni is a Gram-positive, peritrichously flagellated, straight, facultatively alkaliphile, rod-shaped bacterium that was first isolated from indigo <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> in 2013 (Hirota et al. 2013).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In vitro {{techniques}} {{are used to}} predict ruminant feedstuff values or characterise rumen fermentation. As the results are influenced by several factors, such as the relative effects of inocula and substrates, this study aimed to examine in vitro incubation of two total mixed rations (substrates) differing in their proportion of concentrate [low (L) : 350 g kg(- 1) vs. high (H) : 700 g kg(- 1) ] incubated in inocula provided by goats fed either a L or a H diet. Gas production and composition in carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and hydrogen (H- 2), volatile fatty acids (VFAs), soluble carbohydrates (SCs) and ammonia (NH 3) concentrations, and pH of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> were measured. RESULTS: In comparison with the L inoculum and L substrate, the H ones produced more CO 2 and CH 4 gas, which led to higher SCs and VFA concentrations, and lower acetate-to-propionate ratio and NH 3 concentration, with a predominant effect of the inoculum. CONCLUSION: The effects of the inocula and of the substrates were additive using donor animals adapted to the diet...|$|E
40|$|Five gas chromatographic liquid phases (25 % Carbowax 20 M plus 4 % H 3 PO 4, 17. 5 % {{dioctyl sebacate}} plus 7. 5 % sebacic acid, 17. 5 % dioctyl sebacate plus 7. 5 % docosanoic acid, 5 % Tween 80, and 20 % LAC- 296 [poly (diethylene glycol adipate) ] plus 2 % H 3 PO 4) were studied {{with respect to}} their utility in the {{separation}} and quantitation of steam-volatile organic acids commonly produced in fermentation. Optimal operating conditions and column stability for routine analysis were established. An Aerograph Hy-Fi gas chromatograph was used for all work, except the studies with Tween 80 in which an Aerograph A- 90 -C was employed. Chromatographic traces are presented of volatile fatty acid analyses with each of the liquid phases. Complete separation of all isomers of the fatty acids from C 2 to C 5 was accomplished by the Carbowax 20 M plus H 3 PO 4, dioctyl sebacate plus sebacic acid, and dioctyl sebacate plus docosanoic acid columns. The latter two liquid phases were extremely unstable and proved to be unsatisfactory for analysis of aqueous samples. A column of Carbowax 20 M + H 3 PO 4 separated steam-volatile organic acids completely. The volatile fatty acid isomers were separated by 5 % Tween 80 somewhat less completely, and the peak shapes were not as sharp and symmetrical as that desired for good quantitative work. LAC- 296 (20 %) plus 2 % H 3 PO 4 proved to be the most satisfactory of the liquid phases for routine analysis of deproteinated in vitro rumen fermentation media. The column has been used for routine analysis of rumen <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> and in vitro rumen incubation fluid. All the organic acids from C 2 to C 5, except isobutyric, could be quantitated with this column. Stability of the column with the aqueous solutions was extremely good. The standard deviation of the analysis of each volatile acid component in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was less than 0. 5 molar per cent. The short-chain organic acids (C 2 to C 5) were shown to be extremely stable in aqueous solution for as long as 6 months after preparation for gas chromatographic analysis by protein precipitation with metaphosphoric acid-H 2 SO 4 and refrigeration at 4 C in stoppered tubes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop a FTIR method to {{quantify}} amounts and proportions of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia nitrogen (N-NH 3) in <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluids</b> collected in vitro using innovative Bayesian models as chemometric technique. A set of 170 fluids, collected before and after 4 in vitro incubations of 8 diets in 5 replication plus 5 blanks, were analysed for VFA, N-NH 3 and scanned using the MilcoScan FT 2 (Foss Electric, Hillerød, Denmark) in the spectral range between 5000 and 900 cm- 1. A Bayes B model was used to calibrate equations for each fermentative trait. The calibration equation predicts well VFA and N-NH 3 amounts in calibration and also in validation (R 2 VAL ranged from 0. 93 to 0. 83 for isovaleric and n-butyric acid, respectively). However, the prediction of VFA expressed as proportions of total amount was much less accurate (R 2 VAL ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 52 for iso-valeric and n-butyric acid, respectively). In conclusion, FTIR and Bayesian models can be used as tools to accurately predict VFA amounts in vitro...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQuorum sensing (QS) {{is a type}} of microbe-microbe {{communication}} system that is widespread among the microbial world, particularly among microorganisms that are symbiotic with plants and animals. Thereby, the cell-cell signalling is likely to occur in an anaerobic rumen environment, which is a complex microbial ecosystem. In this study, using six ruminally fistulated Liuyang black goats as experimental animals, we aimed to detect the activity of quorum sensing autoinducers (AI) both in vivo and in vitro and to clone the luxS gene that encoded autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) synthase of microbial samples that were collected from the rumen of goats. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and soluble starch were the two types of substrates that were used for in vitro <b>fermentation.</b> The fermented <b>fluid</b> samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of incubation. The acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) activity was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis. However, none of the rumen fluid extracts that were collected from the goat rumen showed the same or similar fragmentation pattern to AHLs standards. Meanwhile, the AI- 2 activity, assayed using a Vibrio harveyi BB 170 bioassay, was negative in all samples that were collected from the goat rumen and from in vitro <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluids.</b> Our results indicated that the activities of AHLs and AI- 2 were not detected in the ruminal contents from six goats and in ruminal fluids obtained from in vitro fermentation at different sampling time-points. However, the homologues of luxS in Prevotella ruminicola were cloned from in vivo and in vitro ruminal fluids. We concluded that AHLs and AI- 2 could not be detected in in vivo and in vitro ruminal fluids of goats using the current detection techniques under current dietary conditions. However, the microbes that inhabited the goat rumen had the potential ability to secrete AI- 2 signaling molecules and {{to communicate with each other}} via AI- 2 -mediated QS because of the presence of luxS...|$|R

Meadow hay and corn grain were incubated for t. (16 and 9 h, respectively) or for 48 h into glass bottles. Each bottle (310 ml) was filled with feed sample (0. 5 g) and 75 ml of buffered rumen fluid, and incubated at 39. 0 °C. Gas production (GP) was measured using the ANKOMRF System, and gas accumulated in headspace of bottles was released at 3. 4 kPa. At t. or 48 h, <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluids</b> were analysed for ammonia N (N-NH 3), volatile fatty acids (VFA), residual NDF and N bound to residual NDF (N-NDF). Values of GP were also predicted from VFA. Microbial N (MN) was computed as the difference between N present {{at the beginning and}} at the end of incubation. At 48 h, the relationship between GP measured and predicted from VFA was weak (R 2 = 0. 67; equation not shown), whereas the linear relationship was better at t. (R 2 = 0. 94). At t., the relationship between N-NH 3 and measured GP was strong (R 2 = 0. 84), as well as that between MN and measured GP (R 2 = 0. 92). Conversely, these variables were not well related at 48 h. At t., the valerate content in rumen fluid was negligible. However, relatively large amounts of valerate were measured after 48 h, probably the result of microbial lysis. Results suggest that relationships among end-products of rumen fermentation can be more accurately evaluated at a substrate-specific incubation time (t.) rather than at 48 h...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of maintaining protozoa populations {{and reduce the}} accumulation of undigested material was investigated in two experiments using a stratified continuous-culture rumen fermenter (CCF) at various setting. The CCF consists of 8 x 2 L glass bottles, warmed at 39 °C and placed on a water proof magnetic stirrer. Bottles are closed with a rubber stopper, with an insert for the inflow of artificial saliva and have the outflow at the base. In Experiment 1 the effect of two stirring frequencies (continuous vs intermittent, S 1 and S 2) and two dilution rates (D, 1. 29 vs 1. 04) on the pH values and on the counts of the protozoa in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was evaluated. The pH reached a steady state after 4 d of fermentation and S 1 bottles had lower pH than those S 2 (6. 50 vs 6. 57, P< 0. 001). The protozoa in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> (2. 92 * 105 /ml at the beginning) declined sharply in the first 2 d of fermentation and stabilized at about 13 * 103 /ml in the S 2 flasks, while the S 1 flasks had lower protozoa concentrations (about 0. 8 * 103 /ml, P< 0. 001). The D had no effects on pH and protozoa. Experiment 2 aimed to test effects of varying the daily diet (F) amount (15, 20, 25, 30 g DM/d of a diet with 50 : 50 forage: concentrate ratio) on the organic matter (OM) digestibility (OMD) and on the fermentative patterns. In 2 fermentation runs of 8 d each, bottles were inoculated with 450 ml of rumen fluid and 1050 ml of artificial saliva, which was then pumped {{at a rate of}} 78 ml/h. Lowering F reduced the OM accumulated inside the vessels (from 5. 06 to 0. 68 g/d; P< 0. 001) but did not affected the OMD for any of the dietary treatments (range between 0. 460 and 0. 510). The reduction of F led to a linear decrease (P< 0. 001) in volatile fatty acids concentration (from 65. 8 to 45. 3 mM), to an increase of acetate:propionate ratio (from 2. 91 to 3. 42) and to a reduction of pH (from 6. 4 - 6. 5 to 6. 0 - 6. 1). Lowering F tended {{to increase the number of}} protozoa (from 72 to 198 * 103 /ml, P= 0. 082).

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} effect of two dietary intestinal digestible protein (PDI) levels and a partial substitution of soybean meal (SBM) with urea (U) {{on the performance of}} finishing Italian Simmental bulls (Exp. 1) and on in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, eighty Italian Simmental bulls (495 ± 58 kg of body weight (BW), 14 -months old) were fed diets differing in terms of PDI concentration (85 and 72 g/kg dry matter (DM), medium (M) and low (L) diets, respectively) and nitrogen source (only SBM or SBM partly replaced by 0. 5 % DM of U) during the last 120 d of fattening. Animals were slaughtered at BW of 656 ± 56 kg at 18 months of age. The average daily gain (ADG) was satisfactory (1. 32 kg/d) and the medium PDI level tended (P< 0. 10) to increase the ADG (1. 37 vs 1. 28 kg/d). Apparent total tract digestibility did not differ between treatments and the feed efficiency tended to be more favourable for the M diets (0. 147 vs 0. 137 kg BW gain/ kg feed DM, P< 0. 10). Slaughter traits were unaffected by dietary treatments. In Exp. 2, continuous culture fermenters were inoculated with rumen fluid from bulls of Exp. 1 and were given the same diets. The <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was sampled at feeding time and 1, 2 and 3 h after (T 0, T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively) and the medium PDI level determined higher ammonia concentrations (P< 0. 01 at T 0, T 1, and T 2; P< 0. 05 at T 3). The drop of pH at T 1 and T 2 was less intense (P< 0. 05) for diets containing U, presumably due to the buffering capacity of urea. In vitro DM digestibility tended to be higher for diets containing U (P< 0. 10) and was unaffected by the dietary level of PDI. Differences in volatile fatty acids concentrations were limited to butyrate, which was higher for M diets (T 0 : 13. 6 vs 12. 5 mol/ 100 mol, P< 0. 10; T 2 : 13. 8 vs 12. 5 mol/ 100 mol, P< 0. 01) and for diets containing U (T 0 : 14. 3 vs 11. 9 mol/ 100 mol; T 2 : 14. 3 vs 12. 1 mol/ 100 mol, P< 0. 01). In conclusion, L diets tended to decrease weight gain in finishing Italian Simmental bulls, but both PDI levels and SBM substitution with U had no detrimental effects on slaughter and meat quality traits.

40|$|Today’s {{pet food}} {{industry}} is growing rapidly, with pet owners demanding high-quality diets for their pets. The primary role of diet {{is to provide}} enough nutrients to meet metabolic requirements, while giving the consumer a feeling of well-being. Diet nutrient composition and digestibility are of crucial importance for health and well being of animals. A recent strategy {{to improve the quality}} of food is the use of “nutraceuticals” or “Functional foods”. At the moment, probiotics and prebiotics are among the most studied and frequently used functional food compounds in pet foods. The present thesis reported results from three different studies. The first study aimed to develop a simple laboratory method to predict pet foods digestibility. The developed method was based on the two-step multi-enzymatic incubation assay described by Vervaeke et al. (1989), with some modification in order to better represent the digestive physiology of dogs. A trial was then conducted to compare in vivo digestibility of pet-foods and in vitro digestibility using the newly developed method. Correlation coefficients showed a close correlation between digestibility data of total dry matter and crude protein obtained with in vivo and in vitro methods (0. 9976 and 0. 9957, respectively). Ether extract presented a lower correlation coefficient, although close to 1 (0. 9098). Based on the present results, the new method could be considered as an alternative system of evaluation of dog foods digestibility, reducing the need for using experimental animals in digestibility trials. The second parte of the study aimed to isolate from dog faeces a Lactobacillus strain capable of exert a probiotic effect on dog intestinal microflora. A L. animalis strain was isolated from the faeces of 17 adult healthy dogs [...] The isolated strain was first studied in vitro when it was added to a canine faecal inoculum (at a final concentration of 6 Log CFU/mL) that was incubated in anaerobic serum bottles and syringes which simulated the large intestine of dogs. Samples of <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours for analysis (ammonia, SCFA, pH, lactobacilli, enterococci, coliforms, clostridia). Consequently, the L. animalis strain was fed to nine dogs having lactobacilli counts lower than 4. 5 Log CFU per g of faeces. The study indicated that the L animalis strain was able to survive gastrointestinal passage and transitorily colonize the dog intestine. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that the L. animalis strain positively influenced composition and metabolism of the intestinal microflora of dogs. The third trail investigated in vitro the effects of several non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) on dog intestinal microflora composition and metabolism. Substrates were fermented using a canine faecal inoculum that was incubated in anaerobic serum bottles and syringes. Substrates were added at the final concentration of 1 g/L (inulin, FOS, pectin, lactitol, gluconic acid) or 4 g/L (chicory). Samples of <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> were collected at 0, 6, and 24 hours for analysis (ammonia, SCFA, pH, lactobacilli, enterococci, coliforms). Gas production was measured throughout the 24 h of the study. Among the tested NDO lactitol showed the best prebiotic properties. In fact, it reduced coliforms and increased lactobacilli counts, enhanced microbial fermentation and promoted the production of SCFA while decreasing BCFA. All the substrates that were investigated showed one or more positive effects on dog faecal microflora metabolism or composition. Further studies (in particular in vivo studies with dogs) will be needed to confirm the prebiotic properties of lactitol and evaluate its optimal level of inclusion in the diet...|$|E

Dry, mature fruits of Acacia nilotica, Acacia erubescens, Acacia erioloba, Dichrostachys cinerea and Piliostigma thonningii were used as substrates for the in vitro fermentation. The effectiveness of adapted rumen fluid to ferment tannin-containing substrates was compared to the extent of fermentation when tannins were inactivated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a known tannin-binding agent. Adapted rumen fluid (P < 0. 05) increased gas production from all five substrates between 15. 8 % and 73. 7 %. In A. nilotica, D. cinerea and P thonningii, this increase was less than that obtained through PEG treatment. When PEG was added to adapted rumen fluid a further improvement in extent of fermentation was observed in four out of the five fruit samples. The largest PEG effect when incubated with adapted rumen fluid was observed in A. nilotica (43. 1 %) and D. cinerea (42. 9 %) fruits. It is concluded that some tannin-rich feedstuffs may still benefit from treatment even when these are offered to adapted animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

For the production of ethanol in the fluid bed fermenter with the yeast S. cerevisiae the influence of various process parameters with respect to <b>fermentation</b> kinetics and <b>fluid</b> bed hydrodynamics is discussed proposing a scale-up-model. Comparison with experimental results obtained from a laboratory scale fluid bed fermenter of 0. 2 m diameter and from pilot scale experiments in a fluid bed of 0. 55 m diameter containing 20 kg of yeast shows that the proposed model serves well to explain the various scale-up effects. Experiments and scale-up modelling shows as well that by obtaining productivities of 40 kg ethanol/m³*h with this new fermenter type optimum productivity is not yet reached...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of reserve {{polysaccharide}} by mixed rumen organisms fermenting glucose, maltose, cellobiose, and xylose {{has been}} studied {{in relation to the}} adenosine triphosphate energy calculated to be available from substrate fermentation. About 80 % of the energy available from glucose and xylose was used for polysaccharide synthesis, whereas, assuming hydrolytic cleavage of the disaccharides, more than 100 % was used when cellobiose and maltose were the substrates. If, however, phosphorolytic cleavage of the disaccharides, for which there is evidence, was involved, the energy from both maltose and cellobiose fermentation was used with about the same efficiency as that from glucose and xylose <b>fermentation.</b> The rumen <b>fluid</b> used was collected 24 hr after feeding, and growth of microorganisms in such samples was sufficient to account for utilization of less than 10 % of the total energy becoming available during the 40 -min incubation period...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine changes in VFA and ammonia concentrations at different time points using 4 fermentable carbohydrate-rich feed ingredients as substrates and feces of unweaned piglets as inoculum. Fecal inoculum was collected, pooled, and mixed from 9 specially raised (no creep feed or antibiotics) crossbred piglets at 3 wk of age. Inulin, lactulose, molasses-free sugar beet pulp, and wheat starch were used as substrates and were fermented in vitro for 72 h (3 replicates per substrate). Cumulative gas production was measured {{as an indicator of}} the kinetics of fermentation. In addition, 3 bottles of substrate per time point with similar contents (amounts of substrate, inoculum, and media) were incubated but were allowed to release their gas throughout incubation. For these latter bottles, <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was sampled at incubation time points including every hour between 1 and 24 h and at 48 h, and fermentation end products (VFA, lactate, and ammonia) and OM disappearance were measured. Dry matter and ash were analyzed from the postfermentative samples. The pH of the contents from these bottles was also recorded. The correlation in time between fermentation end products and cumulative gas produced was determined. The results showed that the prolongation of fermentation to 72 h, {{especially in the case of}} fast-fermenting inulin and lactulose, may lead to a different end product profile (P < 0. 001) compared with the profile observed at the time at which most of the substrate has disappeared. Therefore, we concluded that the fermentation product profile at the end of in vitro fermentation at a specific time point cannot be used to compare fermentability of carbohydrate sources with different fermentation kinetics in terms of gas production...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of methane}} (CH 4) {{produced}} from in vitrorumen fermentation is usually conducted on gas samples collected from headspace of bottles where gas is not vented. However, especially when concentrates are incubated, this procedure {{can lead to}} overestimation of CH 4 values, as no venting causes partial solubilization of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> and an increased concentration of CH 4 in headspace of bottles. This study aimed to measure gas (GP) and CH 4 production using bottles where gas was vented into tight bags. Bottles (310 ml), filled with 60 ml of buffered rumen fluid (headspace= 250 ml) and 0. 040 g of feed sample, were not vented (NV) or vented (VE) at threshold pressure of 6. 8 kPa by a valve connected to tight bag. Three concentrates, different for fermentative properties (corn meal, beet pulp, and flaxseed expeller), were incubated for 24 h at 39 °C. The experimental design was: 3 feeds × 3 replicates × 2 venting systems, plus 4 blanks, {{for a total of}} 22 bottles. A PC wireless-connected to bottles monitored GP, and GP was adjusted for solubilized CO 2. Gas samples (2 μl) were collected from headspace of bottles or from tight bags by a syringe and analyzed for CH 4 by gas-chromatography. Data were analyzed by ANOVA considering feed, venting system and their interaction as sources of variation. Compared to NV, VE system provided greater (P< 0. 01) GP values, for all feeds. Adjustment of GP values removed differences between systems for beet pulp and flaxseed expeller, but not for corn meal. Measured CH 4 concentrations were greater (P< 0. 01) for NV compared to VE, for all feeds. When CH 4 concentrations were adjusted for solubilized CO 2, differences between two systems tended to decrease but did not disappear. Results evidence that gas venting plays a key role to achieve reliable measurements of in vitro CH 4 production...|$|E
40|$|An {{anaerobic}} digestion system was evaluated {{as an alternative}} for poultry mortality disposal. The bench-scale system consisted of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor and three leachbeds (LB). The LBs were batch-loaded with dead chickens and sequentially starred at an average interval of 50 days. Only one LB {{was connected to the}} UASB to form a closed-loop at any one time. Leachate from the LB was fed to the UASB as influent while effluent from the UASB overflowed to the LB to maintain constant liquid volumes in both reactors. The LB-UASB pair initially functioned as a two-phase system, with the LB serving as the hydrolysis/acidification phase and the UASB serving as the methanogenic phase. Through repeated liquid recycle between the LB and the UASB, the LB eventually accumulated enough methanogens to become methanogenic as well. Leachate concentrations from the methanogenic LB dropped rapidly. When the leachate was no longer able to sustain the UASB at high loading rates (LR), the next LB with another dead chicken was connected to the UASB. Digestion of the mortality was considered complete when methane production rate from the off-line LB became marginal. When digestion in an LB was complete, the <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> in the LB was reused to start up the next LB. The first cycle ended when digestion in the third LB was complete. Two cycles were completed during this study. The system satisfactorily completed treatment of seven consecutive batches of mortalities in 432 days. The average CH 4 yield was 0. 679 m(3) (kg dry) (- 1) for 0. 254 m(3) (kg wet) (- 1) ]. However timings of the start-up of an LB anti its subsequent connection to the UASB need to be improved to sustain the system at peak treatment efficiency. Alternatively, the system could include a fourth LB to allow more flexibility in scheduling. Additionally a fifth LB reactor would simplify restarting of an LB from its preceding LB being terminated Cost estimates based on systems with one UASB and five LBs ranged from US$ 118 (10 (3) kg live wt sold) (- 1) for a 10, 000 bird poultry farm to US$ 28 (103 kg live wt sold) (- 1) far a farm with 100, 000 chickens...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine the}} degradation of L-arginine (ARG) and N-carbamoyl glutamate (NCG) and to examine their effect on rumen <b>fermentation.</b> Rumen <b>fluids</b> were collected from 3 rumen-fistulated cows and then incubated with ARG or NCG at 1 mmol/L in a glass syringe system at 39 °C for 24 h. The control treatment was given neither ARG nor NCG. Gas production (GP) was recorded, and pH at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h was also determined. At 12 and 24 h, the measurements were also made for ammonia-nitrogen (N), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbial crude protein (MCP) yield on purine quantification basis. At 24 h, the proportion of ARG and NCG degradation in rumen fluid was 100. 0 and 17. 8 %, respectively. Gas production and the acetate to propionate ratio increased in groups treated with ARG and NCG, compared with the control (P< 0. 01). Ammonia nitrogen concentration was higher (P< 0. 01) in the ARG group than in the NCG and control groups. Microbial crude protein concentration diminished in ARG and NCG groups, in comparison with the control (P< 0. 01). In conclusion, the effects of ARG and NCG on rumen fermentation were numerically relatively similar. Rapid degradation of ARG in rumen is a nutritionally wasteful process. Thus, ARG should be spared from rumen degradation, while NCG could be fed to ruminant without need for coating...|$|R
40|$|Asparagopsis taxiformis has potent antimethanogenic {{activity}} as a feed supplement at 2 % {{of organic matter}} in in vitro bioassays. This study identified the main bioactive natural products and their effects on <b>fermentation</b> using rumen <b>fluid</b> from Bos indicus steers. Polar through to non-polar extracts (water, methanol, dichloromethane and hexane) were tested. The dichloromethane extract was most active, reducing methane production by 79 %. Bromoform was the most abundant natural product in the biomass of Asparagopsis (1723 μg g− 1 dry weight [DW] biomass), followed by dibromochloromethane (15. 8 μg g− 1 DW), bromochloroacetic acid (9. 8 μg g− 1 DW) and dibromoacetic acid (0. 9 μg g− 1 DW). Bromoform and dibromochloromethane had the highest activity with concentrations ≥ 1 μM inhibiting methane production. However, only bromoform was present in sufficient quantities in the biomass at 2 % organic matter to elicit this effect. Importantly, the degradability of organic matter and volatile fatty acids were not affected at effective concentrations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|Gluconic acid (GA) {{derives from}} the {{incomplete}} oxidation of glucose by some Gluconobacter strains. When fed to monogastric animals, GA is poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can reach the lower gut where it is fermented to butyric acid. This study investigated the effect of GA on in vitro growth response and proteolytic state of swine caecal microflora. A diet for pigs (CP 15. 8 %, DE 15. 0 MJ/kg) was predigested in vitro to simulate ileal digestion and later used as the substrate in the in vitro fermentation. Caecal content was collected from 6 pigs, diluted with buffer and used as inoculum. The inoculum was flushed with CO_{ 2 }_ and dispensed into five glass syringes and five vessels per treatment, containing predigested diet. Syringes and vessels were incubated at 39 °C for 24 h. There were 6 treatments: control diet, or control diet with GA added at 2, 000, 4, 000, 6, 000, 8, 000, and 10, 000 ppm. Gas production was measured recording the cumulative volume of gas produced every 30 min. Samples of <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> were collected from each vessel at time 0, 4, 8 and 24 h for ammonia and at time 24 h for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) determination. During the 24 h in vitro caecal fermentation, total gas production and maximum rate of gas production were increased by all GA concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 001). Ammonia in fermentation liquor was reduced by GA at 2, 000 (– 26 %; P < 0. 01) and 4, 000 ppm (– 17 %; P < 0. 05) after 4 h and at all concentrations (P < 0. 001) after 8 h and 24 h, with the only exception of GA at 2, 000 ppm. After 24 h of fermentation, total SCFA, acetic acid, butyric acid, acetic to propionic acid ratio, and acetic + butyric to propionic acid ratio were linearly increased in all GA treatments (P < 0. 001). This study showed that GA can positively influence {{the activity of the}} swine caecal microflora controlling the proteolysis during the 24 h of fermentation moreover implementing the production of butyric acid which maintains the mucosal health status[ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptation}} of dairy cows to methane (CH 4) -mitigating feed additives was evaluated using the in vitro gas production (GP) technique. Nine rumen-fistulated lactating Holstein cows were grouped into three blocks and within blocks {{randomly assigned to}} one of three experimental diets: Control (CON; no feed additive), Agolin Ruminant® (AR; 0. 05 g/kg dry matter (DM)) or lauric acid (LA; 30 g/kg DM). Total mixed rations composed of maize silage, grass silage and concentrate were fed in a 40 : 30 : 30 ratio on DM basis. Rumen fluid was collected from each cow at days − 4, 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22 relative to the introduction of the additives in the diets. On each of these days, a 48 -h GP experiment was performed in which rumen fluid from each individual donor cow was incubated with each of the three substrates that reflected the treatment diets offered to the cows. DM intake was on average 19. 8, 20. 1 and 16. 2 kg/day with an average fat- and protein-corrected milk production of 30. 7, 31. 7 and 26. 2 kg/day with diet CON, AR and LA, respectively. In general, feed additives in the donor cow diet had a larger effect on gas and CH 4 production than the same additives in the incubation substrate. Incubation substrate affected asymptotic GP, half-time of asymptotic CH 4 production, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, molar proportions of propionate and butyrate and degradation of organic matter (OMD), but did not affect CH 4 production. No substrate×day interactions were observed. A significant diet×day interaction was observed for in vitro gas and CH 4 production, total VFA concentration, molar proportions of VFA and OMD. From day 4 onwards, the LA diet persistently reduced gas and CH 4 production, total VFA concentration, acetate molar proportion and OMD, and increased propionate molar proportion. In vitro CH 4 production was reduced by the AR diet on day 8, but not on days 15 and 22. In line with these findings, the molar proportion of propionate in <b>fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was greater, and that of acetate smaller, for the AR diet than for the CON diet on day 8, but not on days 15 and 22. Overall, the data indicate a short-term effect of AR on CH 4 production, whereas the CH 4 -mitigating effect of LA persisted...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different organic acids on bacterial growth and ammonia production by swine cecal microflora in an in vitro fermentation system. Formic, acetic, propionic, lactic, butyric, sorbic, fumaric, malic, citric, α-ketoglutaric, and benzoic acids were used at different concentrations (60, 120 and 240 mmol/l) to assess if any effect on cecal microflora could be shown. Cecal microbial growth was evaluated using the cumulative gas production technique. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>fluid</b> was analyzed for ammonia concentration. Lactic acid was the only acid that enhanced bacterial fermentation at every concentration tested (+ 30 %, 73 %, and 35 % gas final volume at 60, 120, and 240 mmol/l, respectively; P< 0. 05). Citric acid strongly increased gas final volume when used at 60 and 120 mmol/l (+ 92 % and 52 %, respectively; P< 0. 05) and almost completely inhibited bacterial activity at 240 mmol/l (– 85 % gas final volume; P< 0. 05). Sorbic acid showed the strongest antibacterial activity and was the only acid that reduced final gas volume when used at 60 mmol/l (– 34 %; P< 0. 05). Only sorbic (– 34 %, 47 %, and 67 %), fumaric (– 57 %, 35 %, and 26 %), citric (– 31 %, 18 %, and 28 %), and benzoic (– 33 %, 29 %, and 38 %) acids reduced ammonia after 24 h of fermentation at any given concentration (P< 0. 05). Other acids, such as formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, and malic acids failed to exert an effective control of ammonia levels in the fermentation liquor. After the first set of fermentations, sorbic, α-ketoglutaric, and benzoic acids were further tested at the final concentration of 7. 5, 15, and 30 mmol/l. At these lower levels of inclusion, sorbic acid was the only acid that reduced final gas volume at every concentration tested (– 31 %, 35 %, and 39 % at 7. 5, 15, and 30 mmol/l, respectively; P< 0. 05). Compared with control, ammonia was reduced after 24 h of fermentation by all treatments (with an average reduction of 34 %, 20 %, and 24 % for sorbic, α-ketoglutaric, and benzoic acids, respectively; P< 0. 05). In conclusion, gas production data showed that organic acids inhibit or enhance cecal bacterial activity in relation to the type and concentration of acid used. Furthermore, sorbic, α-ketoglutaric, and benzoic acids can positively influence swine cecal microflora in vitro fermentation reducing ammonia concentrations, even when used at low concentrations...|$|E

In vitro {{fermentation}} with expressed rumen fluids {{was used}} to evaluate the apparent comparative digestibilities of plants ingested by Peary caribou (Rungifer turundus pearyi) in arctic Canada. The apparent digestibilities of vascular plant components col-lected in summer and fermented for 60 hours with “summer ” rumen inoculum generally were in the range 50 - 80 %, digestibilities of lichens ranged from 18 - 85 %, and those of mosses from 11 - 35 %. In similar trials in which plants collected in the winter were fer-mented for 60 hours with “winter ” rumen inoculum, the green parts of two sedge species were more digestible (65 and 74 %) than the corresponding cured leaves (25 and 43 %), lichens generally were highly digestible (54 - 83 %), and mosses poorly digested (3 - 1 1 %).
