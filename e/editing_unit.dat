Van Damme's version excises whole characters to insert more scenes and close-ups of his character Chance. When asked about this edit, Van Damme replied that [...] "People pay their money to see me, not to see Lance Henriksen". The MPAA accepted the film after Woo had made 20 cuts to the film. Scenes cut include the opening chase sequence and the Mardi Gras warehouse sequence. A non-action scene that is cut from the film is a romantic scene between Chance and Natasha.|$|E

40|$|This volume {{examines}} the editing of specialised texts as practised by the <b>Editing</b> <b>Unit</b> at the Directorate- General for Translation at the European Commission in Brussels. Following a corpus-assisted approach, it compares two comparable corpora {{of the same}} texts, in their non-edited and edited versions. Using quantitative techniques from corpus linguistics together with manual text analysis, the author reflects on the types of revisions that are made, of a formal, grammatical and lexical nature, and on some phraseological aspects of the edited texts. The conclusions drawn are that the written English representing supranational {{organizations such as the}} European Union institutions continues to be norm-bound, adhering to standard British English. However, traces of influences from other European languages, in terms of false friends, and certain grammatical phrases, characterise the corpus of edited texts more than reference corpora of British English. Similarly to translated language, edited language is also found to be characterised by explicitation and simplification...|$|E
40|$|After {{investigating}} {{the various ways}} in which apparently “original” communication is in fact mediated intralingually, interlingually and intersemiotically, the present paper aims to verify whether {{the various forms of}} mediated discourse have features in common and, if so, whether these shared features derive from specific language-pair interference or whether they are universal across languages, as is increasingly being demonstrated in relation to translational phenomena and in the area of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF). The hypothesis of recurring patterns of linguistic behaviour that are generated by the process of mediation taking place in various modes of communication is tested on the EUROCOM corpus, a corpus of draft texts written in English by non-native speakers within the European Commission (EC) and subsequently revised by native speakers of the EC <b>Editing</b> <b>Unit.</b> The initial results of our investigation into these mediated English texts support the view that, like translators, non-native authors and editors tend to adopt domesticating strategies such as simplification, normalisation, explicitation and levelling-out in an attempt to make texts more easily accessible and intelligible to target audiences. The universal features of mediated discourse observed are then compared to the findings of the research on computer learner corpora, which act as a sort of litmus paper thanks to their predominantly language-specific nature...|$|E
40|$|The rise of English as {{a global}} {{language}} {{has led to an}} exponential growth in the production of texts written in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) by non-native speakers (NNSs) and, concomitantly, the revision of these texts by native speakers (NSs). These are two forms of language mediation characterized by conflicting features: while ELF texts are hybrid texts that inevitably bear the traces of the speaker’s mother tongue, the edited texts are the results of a number of dehybridizing strategies aimed to remove all traces of interference. Despite these differences however, the present paper claims that these forms of mediated English share certain features in common which reflect the tendency of non-native authors and editors alike to simplify the text and make it more explicit in a common effort to cooperate with the target audiences. ELF writing and ELF editing are investigated with data from the EuroCom corpus, a 1 -million-word parallel corpus of texts produced within the European Commission, which includes a subcorpus of texts written in English by speakers of various mother tongues and a subcorpus of the same texts revised by native speakers of the <b>Editing</b> <b>Unit.</b> The investigation is conducted in two stages. In the first stage the editors’ revisions are examined to identify the most frequent lexico-grammatical deviations of ELF writing from NS norms. In the second stage the lexical and syntactic patterns shared by the non-native texts and their edited versions are taken into consideration. These data are then compared with the patterns identified in another variety of language mediation, that is translational language, which differs significantly from non-translational language. The comparison shows that certain differences between NNS and NS production can be explained with reference to the bi- or multilingual situations in which NNSs operate. Like translators, having at least two language systems at their disposal, NNSs have greater resources than NSs, and therefore a greater potential to innovate. Other differences may be explained precisely by those features that set texts written by NNSs apart from texts written by NSs and make them akin to edited and translated texts due to the mediating role that NNSs, editors and translators perform...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of backbone-modified nucleic acids {{has been an}} area of very intense research {{over the last two}} decades. The main reason for this research activity is the instability of nucleic acid based drugs in the intracellular conditions. Changes in the sugar-phosphate backbone invariably bring about the changes in the complementation properties of the nucleic acids. The naturally occurring deoxyribose- (DNA) and ribose (RNA) sugar-phosphate backbones are endowed with considerable differences in their binding affinities towards themselves. This occurs because of the different sugar conformations prevalent in DNA and RNA and the subtle structural changes accruing from these in hydrogen bonding, base-stacking interactions and hydration of major/minor grooves. The six-atom phosphodiester linkages and pentose-sugars give immense opportunities for chemical modifications that lead o several backbone-modified nucleic acid structures. This aticle is focused on such modifications that impart RNA-selective binding properties to the modified nucleic acid mimics and the rationale behind the said selectivity. It is ound that the six-atom sugar-phosphate backbone could be eplaced by either one-atom extended or one-atom <b>edited</b> epeating <b>units,</b> leading to the folded or extended eometries to maintain the internucleoside distance-complementarity. ther important contributions come from electronegativity of he substituent groups, hydration in the major/minor groove, ase stacking etc...|$|R
40|$|Wikipedia {{is a free}} Internet {{encyclopedia}} with {{an enormous}} amount of content. This encyclopedia is written by volunteers with various backgrounds in a collective fashion; anyone can access and edit most of the articles. This open-editing nature may give us prejudice that Wikipedia is an unstable and unreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more accurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have attempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the number of <b>edits</b> as the <b>unit</b> of time, without consideration of real time. In this work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a systematic analysis using the entire history of 34, 534, 110 English Wikipedia articles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the universality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests that it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real time, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by utilizing the number of <b>edits</b> as the <b>unit</b> of time. To account for these results, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing dynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model successfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as distinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the interrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article size. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend to grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high motivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants. We suggest that this decay of participants eventually brings inequality among the editors, which will become more severe with time. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
