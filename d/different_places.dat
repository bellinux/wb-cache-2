5|$|According to Hindu legend, Sati, the {{daughter}} of Prajapati Daksha, married Shiva against the wish of Daksha. Daksha organised a great yajna (sacrifice), but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati sacrificed herself in the fire. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her body into 51 parts, each of which fell on <b>different</b> <b>places</b> on the earth, each creating a Shakti Pitha.|$|E

It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s {{as a result of the}} 1970s energy crisis.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj's {{successor}} as {{the spiritual}} head of BAPS, started to continue fulfilling {{the dream of}} his guru Yogiji Maharaj and prompted devotees {{to look into the}} possibility of building the temple in Delhi. A request for the plan was put forward to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and several <b>different</b> <b>places</b> were suggested, including Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. Pramukh Swami Maharaj stood firm in following the wishes of Yogiji Maharaj to build a temple on the Yamuna.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many <b>different</b> <b>places,</b> so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E

5|$|The {{music to}} The Sorcerer's Apprentice was {{recorded}} on January 9, 1938 at Culver Studios, California with Leopold Stokowski conducting {{a group of}} session musicians. The recording of Rhapsody in Blue used in the film is an edited version of Ferde Grofé's orchestration of the piece performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra with conductor Bruce Broughton. The shortened version was made by cutting 125 bars of piano solo in three <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> A recording of James Levine conducting both pieces with the Philharmonia appears on the film's soundtrack.|$|E

The girls are dressed in beautiful gowns throughout the video, presumably designed by Roberto Cavalli, who designed the costumes for their then-upcoming tour. Vignettes of the girls singing together and separately are sewn {{together to create a}} collage.

He looks into the plants of Egypt, Libya, Asia, northern regions, and then aquatic plants from the Mediterranean, wetlands especially in Egypt, reeds and rushes. He also considers factors that limit the life of plants including diseases and weather damage.|$|E

About 50 million {{years after they}} were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part {{collided}} with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Periyar in 1973, {{conferences}} were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, {{the new head of}} the Dravidar Kazhagam, set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at <b>different</b> <b>places</b> in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in <b>different</b> <b>places</b> and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in <b>different</b> <b>places</b> from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, vampirism {{could occur}} through various means: being excommunicated, desecrating a {{religious}} day, committing a great crime, or dying alone. Other causes included having a cat jump across one's grave, eating meat from a sheep {{killed by a}} wolf, and being cursed. Vrykolakas were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people, giving rise to many folk tales with this theme. Crosses and antidoron (blessed bread) from the church were used as wards in <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> To prevent vampires from rising from the dead, their hearts were pierced with iron nails while resting in their graves, or their bodies burned and the ashes scattered. Because the Church opposed burning people who had received the myron of chrismation in the baptism ritual, cremation was considered a last resort.|$|E
