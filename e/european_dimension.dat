25|$|In 1360 {{the kingdom}} of Galicia was again at the centre of a {{succession}} crisis, this time of <b>European</b> <b>dimension.</b> The throne of Castile was disputed between King King Peter I and his half-brother, Henry Count of Trastámara, within the broader context of the Hundred Years' War. This fratricidal conflict lasted between 1354 and 1369, having its origin in the policies of Peter I, who tried to expand his royal power while leaning on the councils of cities and municipalities; this would {{come at the expense}} of the high nobility, including Castilian families such as Pimentel, Ponce de León, Mendoza, Fernández de Córdoba, and Alvarez de Toledo; and Galician ones as Castro. As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy, although this coalition was soon discontinued.|$|E
500|$|Though {{awareness}} for {{linguistic diversity}} {{is a policy}} target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy {{is the responsibility of}} member states and European Union does not have a [...] "common language policy." [...] Based on the [...] "principle of subsidiarity", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the <b>European</b> <b>dimension</b> in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages. The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.|$|E

50|$|EUROGEO {{was first}} {{established}} in 1979 {{under the name}} of European Standing Conference of Geography Teachers Association (ESCGTA). In the beginning it was an association of associations. In 1994, when other European countries became members, the association took the name of its bulletin, EUROGEO: European Network of Geography Teachers´ Associations. The principal aims of that organisation were to advise and promote the <b>European</b> <b>dimension</b> in geographical education and teaching about the countries of Europe as a contribution towards the development of a <b>European</b> <b>dimension</b> in education. Members were geography teacher associations and geographical associations from around Europe. Presidents of these associations or their representatives attended the bi-annual meetings that were originally organised and funded by the European Commission in Brussels.|$|E

40|$|This is a participant-observer report {{concerning}} curriculum {{deployment of}} Bernard J. F. Lonergan’s insight-based critical realism and general empirical method for interdisciplinary research methods and allied courses in Copenhagen Business School (CBS, Denmark), from 2001 to the present. I also report similar instruction in interdisciplinary methods for management and organization {{studies at the}} International School for Social and Business Studies (ISSB, Slovenia) in 2012. 1 The overall time period has been entirely {{under the aegis of}} the Bologna Process, begun in 1999, and the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), launched in March, 2010. Both the originating Bologna Process and subsequent EHEA envision curriculum development appropriate to “ensure that the European higher education system acquires a world-wide degree of attraction” (European Commission, 2013). In addition, the Bologna Process calls for specification of the “necessary <b>European</b> <b>dimensions</b> of higher education” (Ibid.). The point of this working paper is to report teaching success and indicate potential merits of Lonergan’s general empirical method, grounded in insight-based critical realism, as a robust epistemological basis for EHEA university curriculum and instruction. The design approach to Lonergan’s method offers grounds to think it uniquely adapted for interdisciplinary social science in the complex trans-cultural, multi-lingual, and religiously pluralist EHEA, thus providing curriculum content adequate and appropriate for the “necessary <b>European</b> <b>dimensions</b> of higher education...|$|R

50|$|Constantin Noica became {{during this}} time, {{after his release}} from prison, a {{continental}} metaphysician of <b>European</b> <b>dimensions,</b> arguably {{one of the greatest}} of the late 20th century. His first book published after detention was 27 Steps of the Real in which he unifies three categorial systems, those of Plato, Aristotle, and Kant. Under a Hegelian, but maybe also influenced by Nicolai Hartmann, he thought that reality, divided in three realms, inorganic, organic and spiritual, is characterised by three distinct sets of categories. At the peak of this categorial ladder he put a new category, which reflects the impact that physics had on his thought: the undulation, or the wave, which became thus the supreme category.|$|R
