40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} productive performance and egg quality of Japanese quails fed different types of processed rations (mash, <b>extruded,</b> <b>or</b> pelleted). One hundred and forty-four 18 -w-old quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were housed in galvanized wire cages and fed a 21. 50 % CP and 2850 kcal ME/kg basal feed supplied in mash, <b>extruded,</b> <b>or</b> pelleted form. Experimental data were analyzed by ANOVA as a complete randomized design, with three treatments (ration forms) and six replicates of eight quails each. When necessary, means were compared by Tukey's test at 5 % significance. Quails fed pelleted feed presented higher egg production, feed intake, and egg mass weight as compared to mash- and extruded-diet-fed birds. Under the conditions of the present experiment, it was possible to conclude that the feed physical form did not affect egg quality, except for pelleted diets, which promoted good production performance and high egg mass. However, the use of feed pelleting should be economically analyzed considering the final cost of egg production...|$|R

40|$|Wood-plastic lumber is {{promoted}} {{as being a}} low-maintenance, high-durability product. How-ever, it has-been shown that wood-plastic compos-ites (WPC) exposed to accelerated weathering may experience a color change and/or loss in me-chanical properties.
