He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E

40|$|The thesis "Journalists {{and their}} sources - using sample {{regarding}} issues of <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> and hormonal contraception" aimes {{to observe and}} analyze the techniques journalists are using while working with their sources of informations. Quantitative and qualitative research of six Czech prints (four dailies, two magazines) is dealing with questions Who is being portrait as a relevant source of information for topics, that {{are considered to be}} "soft" or "women's", How his/her point of view is represented or How this work with sources contributes to (re) definiton of hormonal contraception discourse and <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> discourse. These discourses (the historical point of view, as well as feminists, and today's situation) are discussed, together with concepts of sociology of sources, issue of objectivity, social construction of reality, status of experts in the society and other related topics, in theoretical part of the thesis. The qualitative survey showed the key role of experts for both of analyzed topics (hormonal contraception and <b>home</b> <b>deliveries)</b> and it in detail displays the framing and using their image as an authority, in opposition to "voice of non-experts" (for hormonal contraception topics) and "alternative group of mothers and midwifes" (for topics related to <b>home</b> <b>deliveries)</b> ...|$|R

The {{vast majority of}} them in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) where most of all out of health facility deliveries are attended by relatives and traditional births attendants. Poor hygienic conditions, ignorance of clean birth practices and lack of skills to manage the complications when they occur, make <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> unsafe for the mothers and their new-borns. Thus, getting pregnant women to give birth at health facility is critical in the efforts to improve reproductive health outcomes in many LMIC...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In view of {{the growing}} concern for de-medicalizing childbirth, {{the aim of this}} study is to give {{detailed}} figures on the use of medication during <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the Netherlands. Methods: A prospective study of medication use by 68 community midwives during 716 home births in the Netherlands. Results: Medication was used in 58. 4 % of the <b>home</b> <b>deliveries,</b> with an average of 1. 4 drugs per delivery. The drugs used were mostly oxytocin (in 35. 6 % of all deliveries) and local anesthetics (in 32. 9 %). When medication was used, it was administered before cutting the umbilical cord in 16. 7 % of the cases. Prophylactic or routine administration of local anesthesia, postpartum hemorrhages, and retained placenta were the most frequent indications for using medication. Conclusions: The use of medication during <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the Netherlands is low and newborns are minimally exposed to medication. This illustrates the Dutch birth culture, which tends to minimize the medical aspect of childbirth. (C) 2002 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

40|$|In 1998 Bergendahl & Son AB, as {{the sole}} owner {{alongside}} with BTL as a partner, created Matomera. Matomera was unique in Sweden in its concept of selling groceries only on the Internet with no supporting physical store. Instead they used a dedicated warehouse especially designed for this purpose. In B 2 C e-commerce the buying decisions and the face-to-face communication between consumers and companies are separated in time or excluded. Therefore the possibility to interact with and to influence consumers is often restrained to the website and call-centres. Along with this there is an added responsibility of picking and delivering the goods to consumers. When selling groceries on the Internet {{there is a lack}} of knowledge concerning consumer response to websites and consumer requirements on <b>home</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Therefore logistics concerning <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> is an important part in fulfilling consumer demands as the responsibility of picking and delivering has been transferred from the consumer to the grocer. In the case of Matomera, the idea was to deliver groceries home to consumers without any additional distribution fees. However, implementing <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> without additional distribution fees for the consumer failed, and despite award winning websites and marketin...|$|R

25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of rural free delivery (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver it. For this reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox or mail slot {{in order to receive}} <b>home</b> <b>delivery</b> of mail.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : Despite {{efforts by}} {{government}} and other agencies, neonatal {{morbidity and mortality}} continues to be high in India. Among other reasons, newborn care practices are major contributors for such high rates. AIMS: To find out the newborn care practices including delivery practices, immediate care given after birth and breast-feeding practices in an urban slum of Delhi. SETTINGS AND DESIGN : Community based, cross-sectional survey in a resettlement colony (a type of urban slum). MATERIALS AND METHODS : Semi-structured, pre-tested schedule was used to interview 82 mothers of newborns in the study area. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Data was analyzed using Epi - info version 6. 04. Fischer exact test and c 2 test were applied. A P value of less than 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : More than half i. e. 26 (56. 1 &#x 0025;) of <b>home</b> <b>deliveries,</b> which were mostly conducted by dais (24, 91. 3 &#x 0025;) or relatives in 4 (8. 7 &#x 0025;) of <b>home</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Bathing the baby immediately after birth was commonly practiced in 38 (82. 6 &#x 0025;) of <b>home</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Finger was used to clean the air passage {{in most of the}} <b>home</b> <b>deliveries</b> (29, 63 &#x 0025;). About 61 &#x 0025; (28) of home delivered newborns were not weighed at birth. Rooming in was practiced in majority of the cases. A few of home delivered neonates (12) were given injection tetanus toxoid by unqualified practitioners. Use of clip, band or sterile thread to tie the cord and no application to the cord was significantly higher in institutional deliveries. Breast milk as the first feed was significantly more in institutional deliveries. There is an urgent need to reorient health care providers and to educate mothers on clean delivery practices and early neonatal care...|$|R
