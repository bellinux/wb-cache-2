5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E
5|$|Groups of anti-Rwandan {{government}} rebels {{like the}} FDLR, and other <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> remain inside the DRC. The FDLR {{which is the}} greatest concern, was some 6,000 strong, in July 2007. By late 2010 the FDLR's strength however was estimated at 2,500. The other groups are smaller: the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, the Ugandan rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces in the remote area of Mt Rwenzori, and the Burundian Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E
5|$|The {{battered}} {{village of}} Charektar in Kelbajar {{had already seen}} extensive fighting in earlier weeks and was reinforced by both Azerbaijani and <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> as the Armenian offensive commenced on March 27. However, instead of launching a simultaneous attack, only the units in Aghdaban and Narinclar moved out. Melkonian's armored column did not move out until later on and his units faced tenacious resistance on an embankment of entrenched defenses where his forces were forced to retreat. The troops in Vardenis began their assault shortly thereafter but their advance was slowed since they had to trek through the snowy passes of the Murov Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The {{last major}} {{military}} action in Anbar Province occurred on 26 October 2008, {{when a group of}} Army Special Forces conducted a raid into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, the leader of a network of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> who were traveling through Syria. Anbar continued to play a large role in the Iraqi insurgency. That same month AQI announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), an umbrella group led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, a cleric from Anbar. After both Al-Baghdadi and Al-Masri were killed in Tikrit in April 2010, the US believed the new leader of AQI/ISI was Abu Dua al-Badri, a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, several tribes {{located in}} Ramadi {{and led by}} Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha began to form what would {{eventually}} become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The Anbar Awakening helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, {{as well as other}} cities such as Hīt, Haditha, and Rutbah. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, due largely to its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural entry points for <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al-Karmah.|$|E
5|$|On paper, the JNA {{seemed a}} {{powerful}} force, with 2,000 tanks and 300 jet aircraft (mainly Soviet or locally produced). However, by 1991, {{the majority of}} this equipment was 30 years old, as the force consisted primarily of T-54/55 tanks and MiG-21 aircraft. Still, the JNA operated around 300 M-84 tanks (a Yugoslav version of the Soviet T-72) and a sizable fleet of ground-attack aircraft, such as the Soko G-4 Super Galeb and the Soko J-22 Orao, whose armament included AGM-65 Maverick guided missiles. By contrast, more modern cheap anti-tank missiles (like the AT-5) and anti-aircraft missiles (like the SA-14) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry. Before the war the JNA had 169,000 regular troops, including 70,000 professional officers. The fighting in Slovenia brought about {{a great number of}} desertions, and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops. Approximately 100,000 evaded the draft, and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force. The JNA resorted to reliance on irregular militias. Paramilitary units like the White Eagles, Serbian Guard, Dušan Silni, and Serb Volunteer Guard, which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non-Serbs civilians, were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces. There were also <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> supporting the RSK, mostly from Russia. With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992, JNA units were reorganized as the Army of Serb Krajina, which was a direct heir to the JNA organization, with little improvement.|$|E

25|$|In early 2015, {{journalist}} Mary Anne Weaver {{estimated that}} half of ISIL fighters are foreigners. A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in ISIL's ranks in November 2014. US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world.

25|$|The {{fighting}} in Swat {{is the first}} serious insurgent threat from terrorist groups in {{what is known as}} a settled area of Pakistan. Following this, <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> of al-Qaeda loyal to TNSM's Maulana Fazlullah tried to implement strict Islamic law in November 2007. In November 2007, another brigade combat team was deployed with the help of helicopter gunships to crush the uprising. By the beginning of December 2007, the fighting had ended and the military recaptured Swat. Almost ~400 <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> of Maulana Fazlullah were dead along with 15 Pakistani soldiers and 20 civilians in the military suspension. Despite the victory by the military, the <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> of TNSM slowly re-entered Swat over the coming months and started engaging security forces in battles that lasted throughout 2008. By early February 2009, the whole district was in military control.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's {{foreign office}} {{spokesman}} had confirmed {{that there was}} a heavy influx of foreigners aiding the Taliban and that weapons were coming from the adjacent country of Afghanistan. Many Pakistani defence analysts and experts had publicly accused India and Afghanistan of aiding the Taliban to destabilize Pakistan. On May 19, 2009, the Pakistan Army captured three <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> from Mingora District. According to the Pakistani Army, all these <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> were Libyan nationals. The Pakistani Army also captured five Saudi nationals during the search operation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the region}} has since been far from stable, separatist {{activity}} has decreased, though some <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> remain active in Chechnya. In {{the last months of}} 2007, the influence of <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> became apparent again when Dokka Umarov proclaimed the Caucasus Emirate being fought for by the Caucasian Mujahadeen, a pan-Caucasian Islamic state of which Chechnya was to be a province. This move caused a rift in the resistance movement between those supporting the Emirate and those who were in favour of preserving the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.|$|E

25|$|Foreign mujahideen {{have played}} a part in both Chechen wars. After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union and the subsequent Chechen declaration of independence, <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> began entering the region and associating themselves with local rebels (most notably Shamil Basayev). Many of the <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> were veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war. The mujahideen also made a significant financial contribution to the separatists’ cause; with their access to the immense wealth of Salafist charities like al-Haramein, they soon became an invaluable source of funds for the Chechen resistance, which had few resources of its own.|$|E
25|$|According to Abu Hajjar, {{a former}} senior leader of ISIL, <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> receive food, petrol and housing, but unlike native Iraqi or Syrian fighters, they do not receive payment in wages.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, {{additional}} battalions {{were stationed}} by General Musharraf to help curb infiltration into Pakistan through its porous border. The Military Intelligence, Covert Action Division (CAD) and army troops founds many caves and tunnels in White Mountain range {{used by the}} <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> before the military action took place. The Military Intelligence accounts maintained that the tunnels were led into Afghanistan, possible Tora Bora region. Though {{it is difficult to}} know how effective the cordon was on the first night of the military suspension but the military intelligence accounts did confirm that many high-value <b>foreign</b> <b>fighters</b> might have escaped through these tunnels and caves back to Afghanistan.|$|E
