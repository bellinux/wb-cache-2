2500|$|The ET {{has three}} primary structures: [...] an LOX tank, an <b>intertank,</b> and an LH2 tank. [...] Both tanks are {{constructed}} of aluminium alloy skins with support or stability frames as required. The <b>intertank</b> aluminium structure utilizes skin stringers with stabilizing frames. [...] The primary aluminium materials {{used for all}} three structures are 2195 and 2090 alloys. [...] AL 2195 is an Al-Li alloy designed by Lockheed Martin and Reynolds for storage of cryogenics (and used for the SLW version of the ET - earlier versions used Al 2219). [...] Al 2090 is a commercially available Al-Li alloy.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>intertank</b> is the ET {{structural}} connection which joins {{both the}} LOX and LH2 tanks. [...] Its primary functions are to receive and distribute all thrust loads from the SRBs and transfer loads between the tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The LH2 tank is {{the bottom}} portion of the ET. The tank is {{constructed}} of four cylindrical barrel sections, a forward dome, and an aft dome. [...] The barrel sections are joined together by five major ring frames. [...] These ring frames receive and distribute loads. [...] The forward dome-to-barrel frame distributes the loads applied through the <b>intertank</b> structure and is also the flange for attaching the LH2 tank to the <b>intertank.</b> [...] The aft major ring receives orbiter-induced loads from the aft orbiter support struts and SRB-induced loads from the aft SRB support struts. [...] The remaining three ring frames distribute orbiter thrust loads and LOX feedline support loads. [...] Loads from the frames are then distributed through the barrel skin panels. [...] The LH2 tank has a volume of [...] at 29.3 psig (3.02 bar absolute) and [...] (cryogenic).|$|E
2500|$|The tank feeds into a [...] {{diameter}} {{feed line}} that conveys the liquid oxygen through the <b>intertank,</b> then outside the ET to the aft right-hand ET/orbiter disconnect umbilical. The [...] diameter feed line permits liquid oxygen to flow at approximately 2,787lb/s (1264kg/s) with the SSMEs operating at 104% or permits a maximum flow of 17,592 gal/min (1.1099 m³/s).|$|E
2500|$|The Ares V first stage, {{which would}} have been fitted with five RS-68 rocket engines (the same engine used on the Delta IV rocket), will be [...] in diameter, as wide as the S-IC and S-II stages on the Saturn V rocket. [...] It would have {{utilized}} the same internal ET configuration (separate LH2 and LOX tanks separated with an <b>intertank</b> structure), but would have been configured to directly accept LH2 and LOX fill and drain, along with LOX venting on a retractable arm like that used on the Shuttle for LH2 (as the [...] "beanie cap" [...] would have been useless due to the in-line design of the three-stage vehicle).|$|E
2500|$|The ET was the [...] "backbone" [...] of {{the shuttle}} during launch, {{providing}} structural support for attachment with the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and orbiter. The tank was connected to each SRB at one forward attachment point (using a crossbeam through the <b>intertank)</b> and one aft bracket, and it {{was connected to the}} orbiter at one forward attachment bipod and two aft bipods. In the aft attachment area, there were also umbilicals that carried fluids, gases, electrical signals and electrical power between the tank and the orbiter. Electrical signals and controls between the orbiter and the two solid rocket boosters were also routed through those umbilicals.|$|E
2500|$|The ET thermal {{protection}} system consists primarily of spray-on foam insulation (SOFI), plus preformed foam pieces and premolded ablator materials. The system {{also includes the}} use of phenolic thermal insulators to preclude air liquefaction. Thermal isolators are required for liquid hydrogen tank attachments to preclude the liquefaction of air on exposed metal, and to reduce heat flow into the liquid hydrogen. While the warmer liquid oxygen results in fewer thermal requirements, the aluminum of the liquid oxygen tank forward areas require protection from aeroheating. [...] Meanwhile, insulation on the aft surfaces prevents liquified air from pooling in the <b>intertank.</b> [...] The middle cylinder of the oxygen tank, and the propellant lines, could withstand the expected depths of frost accumulation condensed from humidity, but the orbiter could not take the damage from ice breaking free. [...] The {{thermal protection}} system weighs [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{insulation}} was {{cut away}} for additional inspection, revealing two additional 9-inch metal cracks {{on either side}} of an underlying structural rib called [...] "stringer S-7-2". NASA managers then decided to cut away additional foam and observed two more cracks on a stringer known as S-6-2 adjacent to the two original cracks. They were found on the far left of removed foam on the flange area between the <b>intertank</b> and the liquid oxygen tank. However, these cracks appeared to have suffered less stress than the others found. No cracks were found in stringers on the right side. NASA suspected the use of a lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy in the tanks contributed to the crack problem. Repairs commenced while the shuttle remained on the pad. [...] An environmental enclosure was erected around the known damage site to facilitate the ongoing repairs and eventually to apply fresh foam insulation. On 18 November, as part of the repairs, technicians installed new sections of metal, called [...] "doublers" [...] because they are twice as thick as the original stringer metal providing additional strength, to replace the two cracked stringers on Discoverys external tank.|$|E
2500|$|The S-II {{was built}} by North American Aviation at Seal Beach, California. Using liquid {{hydrogen}} and liquid oxygen, it had five Rocketdyne J-2 engines in a similar arrangement to the S-IC, also using the outer engines for control. The S-II was [...] tall with a diameter of , identical to the S-IC, and thus was the largest cryogenic stage until {{the launch of the}} Space Shuttle in 1981. The S-II had a dry weight of about [...] and fully fueled, weighed [...] The second stage accelerated the Saturn V through the upper atmosphere with [...] of thrust in vacuum. When loaded, significantly more than 90 percent of the mass of the stage was propellant; however, the ultra-lightweight design had led to two failures in structural testing. Instead of having an <b>intertank</b> structure to separate the two fuel tanks as was done in the S-IC, the S-II used a common bulkhead that was constructed from both the top of the LOX tank and bottom of the LH2 tank. It consisted of two aluminum sheets separated by a honeycomb structure made of phenolic resin. This bulkhead had to insulate against the 126°F (70°C) temperature gradient between the two tanks. The use of a common bulkhead saved [...] Like the S-IC, the S-II was transported from its manufacturing plant to the Cape by sea.|$|E
