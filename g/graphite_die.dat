5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} of SPS {{is that the}} pulsed DC current directly passes through the <b>graphite</b> <b>die,</b> {{as well as the}} powder compact, in case of conductive samples. Joule heating has been found to play a dominant role in the densification of powder compacts, which results in achieving near theoretical density at lower sintering temperature compared to conventional sintering techniques. The heat generation is internal, in contrast to the conventional hot pressing, where the heat is provided by external heating elements. This facilitates a very high heating or cooling rate (up to 1000 K/min), hence the sintering process generally is very fast (within a few minutes). The general speed of the process ensures it has the potential of densifying powders with nanosize or nanostructure while avoiding coarsening which accompanies standard densification routes. This has made SPS a good method for preparation of ceramics based on nanoparticles with enhanced piezoelectric, thermoelectric, optical [...] or biomedical [...] properties. SPS is also used for sintering of Carbon Nanotubes [...] for development of field electron emission electrodes. While the term [...] "spark plasma sintering" [...] is commonly used, the term is misleading since neither a spark nor a plasma is present in the process. [...] It has been experimentally verified that densification is facilitated by the use of a current.|$|E

As a result, {{it was found that}} the enough heating of the <b>graphite</b> <b>dies</b> that contacts with zirconia powder, and heat transmission from the die to zirconia powder was essential for the success of the sintering with adequate density. Moreover, the lower density region was found at the inside of the can during the process, which corresponded to the region where the convex shape formed in experiments. Furthermore, the high tensile residual circumferential stress was observed at the side wall from the simulation of the cooling process, which is caused by the different thermal expansion ratio of the graphite and zirconia materials.

Fluorite-type solid solution were able to be formed at low temperature, such as 400 degrees C and dense sintered bodies were subsequently fabricated in the temperature ranging from 1000 degrees to 1450 degrees C by conventional sintering (CS) method. To develop high quality solid electrolytes, the microstructure at the atomic level of these doped CeO 2 solid electrolytes were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The specimens obtained by CS had continuous and large micro-domains with a distorted pyrochlore structure or related structure, within each grain. We conclude that the conducting properties in these doped CeO 2 systems are strongly influenced by the micro-domain size in the grain. To minimize the micro-domain size, spark plasma sintering (SPS) was examined.
