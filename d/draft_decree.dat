5000|$|Although a Boyar Duma {{had existed}} in Russia from Muscovite times until {{the rule of}} Peter I, it was an {{advisory}} institution, without legislative prerogatives. Peter abolished this organ in 1721, replacing it with the Governing Senate. This body consisted of nine (later ten) members, and was intended to oversee administration of the empire, {{under the direction of}} an Ober-Procurator, appointed (as were all members of this body) by the sovereign. The emperor might submit <b>draft</b> <b>decree</b> proposals to this committee for their deliberation and recommendations, but he was not bound to do so, nor was he required to accept their advice, once tendered. In later years, the Governing Senate took on an important role in administration and law, and by the late nineteenth century it had evolved into the highest judicial organ in Russia, with all officials and legal institutions under its control. Its decisions as to interpretation of the legal code, unless countermanded by the Tsar, were seen as absolutely authoritative. However, the Senate still remained at all times under the monarch's direct control: he named and dismissed its members, could alter its prerogatives, and was free to overrule its actions. As such, the Ruling Senate was never considered to be a [...] "parliament" [...] in the modern sense.|$|E
