5|$|In July 551, the <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> was {{rocked by}} the 551 Beirut earthquake, which {{triggered}} a tsunami. The combined fatalities of both events probably exceeded 30,000, with tremors being felt from Antioch to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray occurs {{widely in}} the Indo-Pacific, {{with a range}} extending from off eastern South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, westward {{along the coast of}} the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, and reaching as far as Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands to the north, and New Guinea and northern Australia to the southeast. It has also colonized the <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea through the Suez Canal, i.e. it is a Lessepsian migrant, and it is now common in the south <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> This species seems to be common only in Australian waters, where it occurs from Shark Bay to Brisbane.|$|E

With regard to the different results of the Neighbor-Joining trees in different studies, one problem is that A30-B18 is a major component, and yet most studies up until 2002, including gene typing studies failed to achieve a full typing of the HLA-A locus.|$|R

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Waldeck-Rousseau joined the main French fleet that blockaded {{the southern end of}} the Adriatic to prevent the Austro-Hungarian Navy from operating in the Mediterranean. In October and November, Waldeck-Rousseau was twice attacked by Austro-Hungarian U-boats but she escaped unscathed in both engagements. She thereafter alternated between stints in the southern Adriatic and patrols in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> once the Ottoman Empire joined the war in November.|$|E

Empress was returned to her owners in 1919 and was then sold to a French company in 1923. She was scrapped in 1933.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 {{had begun}} when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E

5|$|Ottoman cuisine {{has given}} rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Jerusalem was {{the first}} {{experiment}} in European colonialism creating a 'Europe Overseas' or Outremer. The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing trade between Europe and the outremer. The Italian city states of Genoa and Venice flourished, creating profitable trading colonies in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> This trade was sustained through the middle Byzantine and Ottoman eras, and the communities were often assimilated and known as Levantines or Franco-Levantines.|$|E
