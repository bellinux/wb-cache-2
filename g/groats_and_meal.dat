40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the comparative advantages of export of processed food sector, in order to define the position of the processed food sector in Serbia in compare to the Danube region and highlight the products that were and will be the main exporting agricultural product of Serbia. In this research, we have applied the following indexes: RXA, RTA, ln RXA, RC, RCA, LFI, GL, Sm. We have examined the movement of the index for the period 2005 - 2011 th year. We have investigated the existence of correlations RCA index of processed food sectors with the application of the Pearson and Spearman index determined as RCA variable mutual co-variant. We found that following products showed an increase of comparative advantage in export as measured by the Balassa index: milk products, cheese and curd, <b>groats</b> <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> of other cereals, preparations of cereals, flour, starch, vegetables, roots and tubers, processed, prepared and Fruit products, sugar, molasses and honey, chocolate and other food preparations with cocoa, animal food (including un milled cereals), edible products and preparations, alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, solid vegetable fats, oils, 'soft' and animal and vegetable fats...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{archaeology}} at a Natufian {{site in the}} Southern Levant {{documents for}} the first time the use of 12, 500 -year-old rock-cut mortars for producing wild barley flour, some 2, 000 to 3, 000 years before cereal cultivation. Our reconstruction involved processing wild barley on the prehistoric threshing floor, followed by use of the conical mortars (a common feature in Natufian sites), thereby demonstrating the efficient peeling and milling of hulled grains. This discovery complements nearly 80 years of investigations suggesting that the Natufians regularly harvested almost-ripe wild cereals using sickles hafted with flint blades. Sickles had been replicated in the past and tested in the field for harvesting cereals, thusly obtaining the characteristic sheen along the edge of the hafted flint blades as found in Natufian remnants. Here we report that Natufian wide and narrow conical mortars enabled the processing of wild barley for making the <b>groats</b> <b>and</b> fine flour that provided considerable quantities of nourishment. Dishes in the Early Natufian (15, 000 - 13, 500 CalBP) were <b>groat</b> <b>meals</b> <b>and</b> porridge and subsequently, in the Late Natufian (13, 500 - 11, 700 CalBP), we suggest that unleavened bread made from fine flour was added. These food preparing techniques widened the dietary breadth of the sedentary Natufian hunter-gatherers, paving the way to the emergence of farming communities, the hallmark of the Neolithic Revolution...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the nutritional value of oats and oat products in diets of weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, 115 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 4 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a corn-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) oat <b>groats,</b> <b>and</b> 4) oat flour. Phase I diets were formulated to 1. 55 % lysine, and at d 10 postweaning the pigs were switched to a Phase II diets formulated to 1. 3 % lysine. At d 24 postweaning, all pigs were changed to a sorghum-based Phase III diet. The diets were fed in pelleted form. For Phase I, pigs fed the oat products tended to have greater efficiencies of gain compared to pigs fed corn. Pigs fed the reduced fiber oat products (<b>groats</b> <b>and</b> flour) were more efficient than pigs fed ground whole oats, and the most refined oat product (oat flour) tended to support the greatest efficiencies of gain (8 % greater ADG and 13 % greater F/G than the corn control). These same trends for pigs fed oat flour were noted in Phase II and for the overall experiment (I. e., d 0 to 38). In Exp. 2, 172 weanling pigs (avg initial body wt of 12. 5 lb and avg age of 19 d) were used in a second 38 -d growth assay. Treatments were 1) a com-soybean meal-based control, 2) ground oats, 3) roasted oats, 4) oat groats, 5) steam-flaked oat <b>groats,</b> <b>and</b> 6) oat flour. The data indicated that roasting decreased the nutritional value of ground oats. However, steam-flaking improved the nutritional value of oat groats. Feeding diets formulated with processed oat products (i. e., steam-flaked oat <b>groats</b> <b>and</b> oat flour) improved F/G through Phase II (e. g., 6 % greater efficiency of gain compared to the corn-based control), but much of that advantage was lost during Phase III while the pigs were fed the same sorghum- based diet. In conclusion, the most refined oat products (steam-flaked oat <b>groats</b> <b>and</b> oat flour) supported better F/G than com in Phases I and II. However, cost must be continuously balanced against the improved performance to ensure that use of these oat products is economically viable...|$|R

40|$|Groat {{breakage}} is {{an important}} factor affecting milling yield. Variation for breakage exists among varieties {{but it is not clear}} what physical and/or chemical characteristics are associated with this variation. One hundred and thirteen oat lines were dehulled using a laboratory-scale, constant speed impact dehuller. Breakage was measured as the mass of broken groats in the dehulled sample. Biplot analysis (www. ggebiplot. com) was used to investigate the relationships among <b>groat</b> protein, oil <b>and</b> b-glucan, <b>groat</b> size (mass <b>and</b> length), difference in kernel <b>and</b> <b>groat</b> length <b>and</b> proportion of undehulled kernels. Breakage was most closely associated with kernel size (both mass and length). There was a weak but positive relationship between <b>groat</b> content <b>and</b> breakage. â-glucan and oil content were negatively but weakly associated with breakage. The difference between kernel <b>and</b> <b>groat</b> length was not associated with groat breakage, but was closely associated with the proportion of undehulled kernels.

40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} from animal waste and agricultural by-products can profoundly impact water and soil quality. Diet formulation on a digestible amino acid basis reduces nitrogen excretion. Formulation on a digestible amino acid basis requires reliable estimates of amino acid digestibility. Apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, pearl millet, oat <b>groats,</b> sorghum, <b>and</b> soybean <b>meal</b> {{was measured in}} barrows using the difference method of diet formulation. The {{results indicate that the}} difference method of diet formulation represents a viable application for assessing amino acid digestibility of feedstuffs in pigs. True digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean <b>meal,</b> <b>and</b> wheat by-products (bakery meal, red dog, wheat middlings) used in duck diet formulation was assessed. Cecectomized and intact ducks were subjected to precision feeding and collection methodologies to evaluate the influence of hindgut microflora on nutrient digestibility. The results suggest that variation in amino acid digestibility between cecectomized and intact ducks is considerable for low-protein ingredients, but differences in digestibility are less pronounced with higher amino acid intakes. Similar precision feeding and collection methodologies were employed to characterize the metabolizable energy (ME) of several cereal grains (corn, barley, pearl millet, sorghum, triticale). The study demonstrated the potential utility of pearl millet and sorghum in feed formulation for ducks based on comparable ME to corn. Some agricultural wastes are characterized by high nitrogen {{and phosphorus}} contents. Swine and duck nutrient balance assays were employed to evaluate co-products from a pork processing plant and a commercial microbial fermentation unit. The fermentation co-product was observed to have no feeding value due to poor ability to support nitrogen retention in pigs and ducks. Antinutritional compounds restrict the use of certain ingredients in diet formulation by exerting negative effects on nutrient availability. The effect of new xylanase and phytase preparations on performance of young pigs was investigated. Xylanase in a corn-soybean meal diet failed to influence pig performance, but improvements in growth and feed efficiency were effected by phytase addition to diets. In conclusion, incorporation of nutrient digestibility and exogenous enzyme research findings in commercial diet formulation will aid efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of animal production. ...|$|R
