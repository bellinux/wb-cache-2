50|$|Since {{a patent}} right {{is also a}} kind of {{property}} right, an act of <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> right constitutes a tort, and a patentee who sustains damages {{as a result of}} an act of infringement may demand damages from the infringer in tort (Article 709 of the Civil Code). Unlike an ordinary tortious act however, in the case of the <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> right, it is often difficult to prove the amount of the loss, as well as intent or negligence on the part of the infringer. For that reason, the Patent Act contains a special provision for calculating the amount of loss (Article 102), a provision on the presumption of negligence (Article 103), and a provision permitting the determination of a reasonable amount of loss (Article 105-3).|$|E

LabCorp argued that the correlation is a principle of nature, and therefore the patent {{should never have been}} granted. The court dismissed the case, although Justice Breyer, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter dissented from this decision.
