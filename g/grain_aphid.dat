40|$|Aphids are a {{huge problem}} in organic {{greenhouse}} production systems of sweet pepper, eggplant and cucumber in northern Europe. Biological control with arthropod natural enemies is often not effective, resulting in large crop losses yearly. Entomopathogenic fungi of the order Entomophthorales {{are known for their}} ability to cause epizootics and reduce host populations dramatically in a short time. These abilities make them potentially more effective biological control agents of pest species than commercially available entomopathogens of the order Hypocreales (e. g., fungi of the genus Beauveria, Metarhizium, Lecanicillium and Isaria).

40|$|Background: <b>Grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F) and {{pea aphid}} (Acyrthosiphon pisum) are two agriculturally {{important}} pest species, which cause significant yield losses to crop plants {{each year by}} inflicting damage both through the direct effects of feeding and by vectoring debilitating plant viruses. Although a close phylogenetic relationship between <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and pea aphid was proposed, the biological variations between these two aphid species are obvious. While the host ranges of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> is restricted to cereal crops and in particular wheat, that of pea aphid is wider, mainly colonizing leguminous plant species. Until now, the genetic factors underlying the divergence between <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and pea aphid still remain unclear due to the limited genomic data of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> available in public databases. Results: Based {{on a set of}} transcriptome data of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> generated by using Roche 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing, comparative analysis between this set of transcriptome data of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and mRNA sequences of pea aphid available in the public databases was performed. Compared with mRNA sequences of pea aphid, 4, 857 unigenes were found to be specifically presented in the transcriptome of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> under the rearing conditions described in this study. Furthermore, 3, 368 orthologous pairs which could be calculated with both nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitutions were used to infer their sequence divergences. The average differences in the coding, 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions of these orthologs were 10. 53 %, 21. 29 % and 18. 96 %, respectively. Moreover, of 340 orthologs which were identified to have evolved in response to positive selection based on the rates of Ka and Ks substitutions, 186 were predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism and xenobiotic metabolisms which might contribute to the divergence of these two aphid species. Conclusions: The comprehensive transcriptome divergent sequence analysis between <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and pea aphid provides an invaluable resource for the investigation of genes involved in host plant adaptation and evolution. Moreover, the demonstration of divergent transcriptome sequences between <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and pea aphid pave the way for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the biological variations of these two agriculturally important aphid species. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Insects {{are often}} {{infected}} with facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which {{can have a}} range of important ecological effects. The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, harbours diverse facultative symbionts, which suggests their importance in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> biology. This thesis attempts to explain the ecological roles of the facultative endosymbionts in S. avenae. It also examines {{the question of whether the}} horizontal transmission of symbionts between aphid clones and species can be important for shaping the ecology and evolution of multi-species aphid communities. Novel techniques developed for research with the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> study system are presented. <b>Grain</b> <b>aphid</b> clones vary in their tolerance to low temperatures, but this trait is not affected by their facultative endosymbionts. Strains of a symbiont Hamiltonella defensa do not protect grain aphids from hymenopterous parasitoids, regardless of the host genotype. However, experienced parasitoid females preferentially oviposit in aphids which do not harbour symbionts. Comparison of the fitness consequences of infection with the same Hamiltonella strains in their original and in novel <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones reveal no consistent differences. Symbiont strains establish easily following artificial transfer between clones of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> but the symbionts transferred from other aphid species form less stable infections. Hamiltonella strains do not affect the fecundity of their <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones regardless of their host species of origin, but also do not generally confer protection against parasitoids. There are no clear patterns in the distribution of parasitoid-resistant phenotypes across phylogenetic trees of Hamiltonella and its bacteriophage APSE. Strains of four unrelated species of endosymbionts, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsiella and Regiella, confer the same pathogen-resistant phenotype to a single pea aphid clone. The same symbiont strains can confer resistance to clones of two different aphid species. Some strains in multiple infections may compensate for the costs of infections with other symbionts. The importance of these results for understanding the ecological and evolutionary role of facultative endosymbionts in aphids and other insects are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed.

40|$|The use of {{intercropping}} as {{a strategy}} for increasing biodiversity in fields {{has the potential to}} reduce pest damage and improve the crop production. Here, a study was undertaken to evaluate the role of different wheat-pea intercropping patterns in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cereal aphids in agroecosystems. Wheat-pea intercropping in an 8 - 2 row pattern of wheat and pea, respectively, preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of wheat. The highest abundance of ladybeetles in 2008 and 2009 occurred in the 8 - 2 row pattern, whereas the highest densities of aphid parasitoids were found in the 4 - 2 row pattern in 2008 and the 8 - 2 row pattern in 2009. The distribution of aphid populations in the peak stage was spatially heterogeneous, and the highest density of aphids was shown visually in wheat monoculture fields. The land equivalent ratio of 1. 121 : 1. 187 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2008 and 1. 114 : 1. 174 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2009 showed that intercropping of wheat and pea has potential to improve the utilization of plant growth resources as compared to sole crops.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} {{pathogens}} contribute to ear disease in cereals globally, causing yield losses, decreased grain quality, and mycotoxin accumulation in infected grain. Wheat {{is susceptible to}} head blight disease after ear emergence, during which time ears can also act as hosts for other biological agents, including insects. <b>Grain</b> <b>aphids,</b> Sitobion avenae, colonise ears preferentially over other tissues of wheat plants, and mutual attack of wheat by <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> and Fusarium pathogens is {{likely to occur in}} the field. Experiments were conducted to elucidate the nature of the interactions that occur between the plant host, aphid pests and Fusarium pathogens. When aphids had also attacked the host plant, exacerbated disease severity was observed for both Fusarium graminearum and F. langsethiae. Of particular interest was the finding of an increase in mycotoxin accumulation in infected grain when there was aphid herbivory of host plants. Transmission of either species by aphids was not consistently observed, although the apparent compatibility of F. langsethiae with aphid vectors was greater than for F. graminearum. F. langsethiae was transmitted by aphids when moved manually from infected host ears to susceptible healthy ears, but transmission by natural movement of both winged and wingless aphids failed to produce disease in new hosts. In contrast, deoxynivalenol-producing F. graminearum induced the production of volatile host chemicals that repelled aphids, and population dynamics of aphids that colonised wheat ears infected with F. graminearum were impacted negatively, as observed by increased mortality and decreased fecundity of aphids from diseased hosts. The role of mycotoxins in the production of host volatiles was assessed by comparing F. graminearum isolates of different chemotypes, including mycotoxin deficient mutants. In contrast to hosts infected with DON-producing F. graminearum, which produced VOCs that repelled aphids, hosts infected with a nivalenol (NIV) -producing F. graminearum isolate produced VOCs that were attractive to aphids. This response was shown to be due to the mycotoxin production of the pathogen, as a transgenic line of the same isolate deficient impaired in trichothecene production produced no such effect. The importance of timing and location of aphid herbivory relative to the infection site on the development and spread of disease was examined. It was observed that the longer the time of aphid colonisation on hosts prior to the arrival of fungal inoculum, the more severe the consequences of disease for host plants in terms of fungal biomass and visual disease severity. Aphid herbivory on host ears led to a greater increase in disease severity and spread than infestation of leaves. Systemically treated plants also became more vulnerable to elevated pathogen colonisation; however local effects were more influential on disease outcome. The current research findings show the value of considering interactions between plant pathogens and insects. These are usually studied separately but occur together in nature and in this case the insect had a major impact on disease development. This opens questions about how aphids improve host suitability which could be answered by transcriptomic approaches. The study has important practical implications because it suggests that by incorporating traits for resistance to aphids, breeding for FHB resistance could be improved in wheat. Furthermore, control of aphid populations prior to and during heading could reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination of wheat crops...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Field biology {{studies of}} three <b>grain</b> <b>aphids,</b> Macrosiphum avenae (Fabr.), Acyrthosiphon dirhodum (Walker), and Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) were {{conducted}} near Corvallis, Oregon, from 1961 to 1964. Populations of M. avenae {{were found on}} grain plants, and alatae entering spring barley may have been from wheat fields. Specimens were found more commonly on plants taller than six inches. Orchardgrass supported the largest numbers of A. dirhodum during the winter. Many grain and grass plants were inhabited by R, padi during mid-winter, and this species survived temperatures below freezing. Aphids of these three species were not found during August and September. Aphid flight was sampled using sticky traps which caught aphids from March 3 to November 14; the major flights of M. avenae and A. dirhodum occurred during July and R. padi during June. M. avenae populations appeared on spring barley in May, peaked in July and declined to zero by July 31. The first appearance of M. avenae was related to planting dates of the barley. A. dirhodum appeared in the barley fields two weeks later than M. avenae and the populations reached less distinct and lower peak numbers. R. padi appeared later {{in the spring and}} in lower numbers than the other two species. The number of aphids per infested plant increased as the number of plants infested increased.

40|$|Background: The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest {{which causes}} significant yield losses of wheat in China, Europe and North America annually. Transcriptome profiling of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> alimentary canal after feeding on wheat plants could provide comprehensive gene expression information involved in feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, selection of aphid-specific RNAi target genes would be essential for utilizing a plant-mediated RNAi strategy to control aphids via a non-toxic mode of action. However, due to the tiny size of the alimentary canal and lack of genomic information on <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> as a whole, selection of the RNAi targets is a challenging task {{that as far as}} we are aware, has never been documented previously. Results: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of grain aphids before and after feeding on wheat plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The transcriptome profiling generated 30, 427 unigenes with an average length of 664 bp. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomes of alimentary canals of pre- and post feeding grain aphids indicated that 5490 unigenes were differentially expressed, among which, diverse genes and/or pathways were identified and annotated. Based on the RPKM values of these unigenes, 16 of them that were significantly up or down-regulated upon feeding were selected for dsRNA artificial feeding assay. Of these, 5 unigenes led to higher mortality and developmental stunting in an artificial feeding assay due to the down-regulation of the target gene expression. Finally, by adding fluorescently labelled dsRNA into the artificial diet, the spread of fluorescence signal in the whole body tissues of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> was observed. Conclusions: Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of the alimentary canals of pre- and post-feeding grain aphids on wheat plants provided comprehensive gene expression information that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying feeding, ingestion and digestion.

40|$|Background: The {{sesquiterpene}} (E) -ß-farnesene is {{the main}} component of the alarm pheromone system of various aphid species studied to date, including the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies, such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E) -ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphidpredator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception, have conserved regions involved in binding (E) -ß-farnesene. Methodology: We cloned OBP genes from the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter, we tested binding of (E) -ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds, including a green leaf volatile attractant.

40|$|The thesis investigates aphids and thrips in cereals - their biology, occurrence, {{economic}} damage, {{migration and}} control by integrated pest management. Experiments {{were carried out}} in all types of cereals in southern Sweden during the period 1978 - 2003. The main pest problem in these cereals is the aphid Sitobion avenae. It attacks wheat, the most valuable crop and the second in acreage. A crop loss model is presented based on average annual yield loss in field experiments in high yielding varieties. The most serious thrips pests are Limothrips cerealium and L. denticornis. Other thrips such as Haplothrips aculeatus, Stenothrips graminum, Thrips angusticeps and Frankliniella tenuicornis are minor pests not causing serious damage to cereals but occurring practically every year. Yield loss and economic injury levels were estimated for S. avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, L. denticornis, L. cerealium and S. graminum. Grain quality parameters such as protein content, germination rate and mycotoxin concentrations in crops attacked by aphids and thrips were generally not decreased {{in a way that}} affected the price of the product. The compensation ability of cereals against aphids and thrips is considerable, probably because of the high number of tillers {{and the fact that the}} pests generally do not directly attack the grains. Warning and forecasting are essential within integrated pest management, and knowledge about the effect of weather on different pests is important, particularly in southern Sweden where several pests are on the northern limit of their geographical range. Weather is particularly important for L. cerealium and S. avenae. Investigations on the spatio-temporal dynamics of thrips in cereal crops during a single year revealed that many thrips species interact with acreage of the different cereals grown. The strong flyers, L. cerealium and L. denticornis, are specialised on cereals and their two generations provide the best possibilities to utilise different crops in the landscape. Populations of <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> were kept around a certain number, probably by natural predators, with aphid years followed by low populations, the so-called density dependence.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that agricultural management affects microbial biomass and community composition. We investigated the functional implications of such effects in terms of barley biomass production and nutrient acquisition, and whether changes in barley nutrient status affected aphid fecundity. Soils were collected from conventional, ley and organic arable fields and used as inocula in a glasshouse experiment. We determined microbial biomass and community composition using PLFA. We investigated barley growth and nutrient responses to the different soil inoculums, and the impact of excluding arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Aphids were applied to plants within clip cages and numbers of offspring counted. Microbial biomass and community composition were unaffected by agricultural management. The microbial communities altered root and shoot biomass and nutrient allocation, but had no effect on grain yield. Exclusion of AMF significantly increased shoot biomass but reduced <b>grain</b> yield. <b>Aphid</b> fecundity was not significantly affected by the microbial community or shoot nitrogen. We conclude that agricultural intensification does not necessarily have negative consequences for above- and below-ground interactions, and microbial communities from conventionally managed soils may offer equal benefit to crop productivity and nutrition as those from organically managed soils.

40|$|The role of {{proteins}} in cerals resistance against the aphids is still poorly recognized. It was discussed if feeding preferences of these insects are related only to their nutritional demands, or rather to {{their reaction to}} the toxic compounds in plant tissues. Nowadays it is accepted that both the nutrients and other chemical factors determine their preferences of host plant. Aphid feeding on cereals is limited mainly by the proteins due to their low content, strongly dependent on the plant's age. Therefore, protein availability may be a limiting factor for <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> growth and reproduction. Electrophoretic composition of main plant protein fractions may also affect the choice and acceptance of host plant by the aphids, and thus determine its high natural resistance. The study was done on two winter triticale cultivars of different resistance against <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.). Malno cultivar was relatively resistant, while Tewo was susceptible to that aphid species. The albumins and globulins were isolated from the flag leaves collected in the sixth leaf phase (G. S. 44), according to Chen and Bushuk [1]. Separation of albumins and globulins wa...|$|E
40|$|The {{feeding period}} of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, an {{important}} vector of {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV), was studied in six varieties of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in an attempt to explain the resistance mechanisms in some barley varieties to BYDV. There {{was no significant difference in}} aphid feeding period between the resistant and susceptible varieties. The mechanisms underlying BYDV resistance do not seem to involve factors related to alterations in the feeding period. Suggestions for future studies are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{has been}} widely used in functional genomics of insects and received intensive attention {{in the development of}} RNAi-based plants for insect control. Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle protein (USP) play important roles in molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction of insects. EcR and USP orthologs and their function in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) have not been documented yet. Here, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, dsRNA feeding assay and aphid bioassay were employed to isolate EcR and USP orthologs in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> investigate their expression patterns, and evaluate the effect of RNAi on aphid survival and fecundity, and its persistence. The results indicated that SaEcR and SaUSP exhibited similar expression profiles at different developmental stages. Oral administration of dsRNAs of SaEcR and dsSaUSP significantly decreased the survival of aphids due to the down-regulation of these two genes, respectively. The silencing effect was persistent and transgenerational, as demonstrated by the reduced survival and fecundity due to knock-down of SaEcR and SaUSP in both the surviving aphids and their offspring, even after switching to aphid-susceptible wheat plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SaEcR and SaUSP are essential genes in aphid growth and development, and could be used as RNAi targets for wheat aphid control...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} {{of a field}} and laboratory study {{on the influence of}} adult, coccinellid predators Coccinella septempunctata (L.) and braconid parasitoids Aphidius rhopalosiphi deStefani-Perez on the spread of barley yellow dwarf virus by bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi (L.)) and English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae (F.)). Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) is the most widespread and economically important disease of cereals world wide (Plumb 1983). Though BYD virus produces a disease in cereals, the disease epidemiology is obligatorily dependent upon aphids for all movement and spatial development (Irwin and Thresh 1990) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (McAb), EGA- 4 A 9, {{was developed to}} detect the semi-digested proteins of the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in predatory ladybird beetles (species of the genera Adonia, Coccinella, Hippodamia, and Propylea) using the gut homogenate of Adonia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) adults which had fed on S. avenae as immunogen. The McAb was selected by screening hybridoma lines for antibodies that bound with the semi-digested aphid proteins in ladybirds. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using ClonotypingTM System/HRP showed that it belonged to the IgG 2 a isotype. It did not cross-react {{with any of the}} 21 arthropod species tested besides the ladybird beetles fed on S. avenae with an indirect ELISA. It could still detect the semi-digested proteins in the gut of a ladybird adult, kept at 25 °C, that had ingested one aphid 6 days before. The extended antigen detection period and the high specificity of the antibody indicated that EGA- 4 A 9 could be used to study interactions between English grain aphids and their ladybird predators in the field. Between 28 and 72 % of coccinellids collected from the field were positive for English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> protein by ELISA. The percentage of McAb-positive predatory ladybird beetles was positively correlated with the density of S. avenae in wheat field...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{expression}} patterns of superoxide dismutase genes (sod 2, sod 3. 4, sod 9 and sodB) in seedling leaves of the Zea mays L. Tasty Sweet (susceptible) and Ambrozja (relatively resistant) cultivars infested with one of two hemipteran species, namely monophagous Sitobion avenae F. (<b>grain</b> <b>aphid)</b> or oligophagous Rhopalosiphum padi L. (bird cherry-oat aphid). Secondarily, aphid-elicited alternations in the antioxidative capacity towards DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical in insect-stressed plants were evaluated. Comprehensive comparison of expression profiles of the four sod genes showed that both insect species evoked significant upregulation of three genes sod 2, sod 3. 4 and sod 9). However, aphid infestation affected non-significant fluctuations in expression of sodB gene in seedlings of both maize genotypes. The highest levels of transcript accumulation occurred at 8 h (sod 2 and sod 3. 4) or 24 h (sod 9) post-infestation, and aphid-induced changes in the expression of sod genes were more dramatic in the Ambrozja cultivar than in the Tasty Sweet variety. Furthermore, bird cherry-oat aphid colonization had a more substantial impact on levels of DPPH radical scavenging activity in infested host seedlings than <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization. Additionally, Ambrozja plants infested by either hemipteran species showed markedly lower antioxidative capacity compared with attacked Tasty Sweet plants...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol on the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and its parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) using in vitro laboratory experiments. In this tritrophic interaction, deoxynivalenol caused lethal (declined survival) and sublethal (prolonged nymphal development and reduced reproduction) effects on S. avenae aphids and consequentially led to a decreased production of parasitoid offspring resulting from parasitized deoxynivalenol-contaminated aphids. This paper highlights that the presence of mycotoxins should be considered in environmental risk assessment tests because they may alter the efficiency of biological control agents such as parasitoids through food chain contamination...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and compare the guilds of parasitic Hymenoptera associated with the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> on rye and winter wheat in northern Poland. Of the seven species of primary parasitoids (Braconidae: Aphidiinae, Aphelinidae), parasitizing colonies of Sitobion avenae, the most numerous and most frequently occurring, included Praon volucre, Aphidius ervi and Aphidius uzbekistanicus. Primary parasitoids of grain aphids were largely eliminated by hyperparasitoids, mostly of the families Megaspilidae (Dendrocerus carpenteri), Figitidae-Alloxystini (Alloxysta spp. and Phaenoglyphis villosa) and Pteromalidae (Pachyneuron aphidis, Asaphes vulgaris, Coruna clavata), but D. carpenteri and Alloxysta spp. belonged to dominants and subdominants, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Changes in lysine decarboxylase (LDC) {{activity}} {{caused by}} Sitobion avenae (F.) feeding on two winter triticale cultivars (cvs) were studied. The aphid fecundity {{and values of}} intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} showed that cv Witon was less susceptible to S. avenae than cv Tornado. The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding on more susceptible triticale caused a decrease in the LDC activity, with exceptions of root tissues after two weeks of the feeding. In case of less susceptible cv Witon reduction of the LDC activity was observed only during initial period of S. avenae feeding.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Integrated {{management of}} crop pests requires {{the identification of}} the appropriate spatial scale at which colonization processes occurs. We assessed, by coupling demographic and genetic methods, the relative contribution of local and transient migrants of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Sitobion avenae to wheat field colonization in spring. 2. We examined, during two consecutive years, the daily colonization of wheat by aphid migrants and compared this with daily aphid flight monitored by a local 12. 2 -m suction trap. The genetic profiles of aphids landing on crops were compared with those of both flying aphids caught by the suction trap and local populations from arable crops and hedgerows. 3. In the first year, we observed: (i) a strong correlation between aphids colonizing the crop and those moving within the crop and a close genetic similarity between aphids from these samples and (ii) a high level of genetic differentiation between these aphids and populations from local cereals and field margins. In the second year, the number of migrants recorded on the wheat was three-fold higher than in the previous year, and less correlated with that recorded by the suction trap. This was associated with a lack of genetic differentiation between all samples. 4. This variation in the colonization processes resulted mainly in an abrupt increase in abundance of genotypes from local over-wintering sites in 2004. This suggests that, despite the long range dispersal potential of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> outbreak risks could be mainly determined at a local scale, encouraging the design of relatively small management units...|$|E
