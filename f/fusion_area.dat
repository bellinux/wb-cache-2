40|$|Data fusion {{has been}} {{identified}} by the Department of Defense as a critical technology for the U. S. defense industry. Data fusion requires combining expertise in two areas - sensors and information integration. Although data fusion is a rapidly growing area, there is little synergy and use of common, reusable, and/or tailorable objects and models, especially across different disciplines. The Laboratory-Directed Research and Development project had two purposes: {{to see if a}} natural language-based information modeling methodology could be used for data fusion problems, and if so, to determine whether this methodology would help identify commonalities across areas and achieve greater synergy. The project confirmed both of the initial hypotheses: that the natural language-based information modeling methodology could be used effectively in data <b>fusion</b> <b>areas</b> and that commonalities could be found that would allow synergy across various data <b>fusion</b> <b>areas.</b> The project found five common objects that are the basis for all of the data <b>fusion</b> <b>areas</b> examined: targets, behaviors, environments, signatures, and sensors. Many of the objects and the specific facts related to these objects were common across several areas and could easily be reused. In some cases, even the terminology remained the same. In other cases, different areas had their own terminology, but the concepts were the same. This commonality is important with the growing use of multisensor data fusion. Data fusion is much more difficult if each type of sensor uses its own objects and models rather than building on a common set. This report introduces data fusion, discusses how the synergy generated by this LDRD would have benefited an earlier successful project and contains a summary information model from that project, describes a preliminary management information model, and explains how information integration can facilitate cross-treaty synergy for various arms control treaties...|$|R
40|$|Spine fusion {{is usually}} done to obtain good lateral and anteroposterior stability, or for {{cosmetic}} improvement, or for both. Almost 50 per cent. of all spine fusions are {{performed in the}} thoracic area. The removal of a bone graft is often very difficult, and always causes an additional scar. Therefore, a procedure has been sought which would give a greater <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> with increased stability, {{and at the same}} time would eliminate the many objections to the removal of additional bone. During the past four years the following procedure has been routinely used by the author for fusion of the thoracic spine. It differs from the usual Hibbs fusion operation in that the transverse processes are com-pletely removed subperiosteally, thus producing a much greater <b>fusion</b> <b>area.</b> A: Width and shape of the usual <b>fusion</b> <b>area.</b> B: Width and shape of the suggested <b>fusion</b> <b>area.</b> C: Increased depth of suggested fusion. TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION The usual mid-line incision is made down to the spinous processes which are exposed subperiosteally. Stripping with an elevator is then continued laterally over the laminae and out the tranverse processes. This is not difficult as the process is usually just a continuation of the lamina. An osteotome is driven through the base of the transverse proc-ess, which is lifted with a clamp, and the under surface is stripped with an elevator or scissors.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of low–intensity pulsed {{ultrasound}} in the posterolateral lumbar fusion of rabbit. MethodsA total of 48 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into the observation group and control group, including the autogenous iliac observation group, artificial bone observation group, artificial bone control group and autogenous iliac control group according to the different bone grafting. The posterolateral lumbar fusion of rabbits in each group was analyzed and compared. ResultsAfter 4 weeks of treatment using the low–intensity pulsed ultrasound, the fusion in the bone grafting area of observation group was good. There was the relatively dense <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> between the right transverse process and artificial bone. The left transverse process had been completely fused, with the clear bone trabecula through the <b>fusion</b> <b>area.</b> There was no significant fusion sign in the control group. According to the fusion comparison between two groups, the fusion rate of the observation group was 83. 3 % and it {{was significantly higher than}} the one of the control group (37. 5 %). Results of the comparison were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). The number of chondrocytes and the increase in the relative gray–scale in the <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> of the iliac observation group were significantly higher than ones of the iliac control group (P< 0. 05). The number of chondrocytes and the increase in the relative gray–scale in the <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> of the artificial bone observation group were significantly higher than ones of the artificial bone control group (P< 0. 05). The expression of IL– 1, IL– 6 and IL– 17 4 weeks after the treatment of the observation group was significantly lower than the one of the control group, with the statistical significance (P< 0. 05). It indicated that the treatment of low–intensity pulsed ultrasound could reduce the expression level of inflammatory factors. ConclusionsThe low–intensity pulsed ultrasound can significantly increase the bone grafting fusion rate of the rabbit's posterolateral lumbar fusion. The possible mechanism is that it promotes the lumbar posterolateral endochondral ossification and reduces the inflammatory reaction...|$|E
40|$|Data fusion is the {{integration}} {{and analysis of}} data from multiple sensors to develop a more accurate understanding of a situation and determine {{how to respond to}} it. Although data fusion can be applied in many situations, this paper focuses on its application to manufacturing and how it changes some of the more traditional, less adaptive information models that support the design and manufacturing functions. The paper consists of four parts: Section 1 defines data fusion and explains its impact on manufacturing. Section 2 describes an information system architecture and explains the natural language-based information modeling methodology used by this research project. Section 3 identifies the major design and manufacturing functions, reviews the information models required to support them, and then shows how these models must be extended to support data fusion. Section 4 discusses the future directions of this work. This report is one of three produced by an FY 93 LDRD project, Information Integration for Data Fusion. The project confirmed: (1) that the natural language-based information modeling methodology could be used effectively in data <b>fusion</b> <b>areas,</b> and (2) that commonalities could be found that would allow synergy across various data <b>fusion</b> <b>areas,</b> such as defense, manufacturing, and health care.

40|$|International audienceFor any image guided surgery, {{independently}} of the technique which is used (navigation, templates, robotics), {{it is necessary to}} get a 3 D bone surface model from CT or MR images. Such model is used for planning, registration and visualization. We report that graphical representation of patient bony structure and the surgical tools, inter-connectively with the tracking device and patient-to-image registration are crucial components in such system. For Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA), there are many challenges. The most of cases that we are working with are pathological cases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis disease. The CT images of these cases often show a <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> between the glenoid cavity and the humeral head. They also show severe deformations of the humeral head surface that result in a loss of contours. These <b>fusion</b> <b>area</b> and image quality problems are also amplified by well-known CT-scan artifacts like beam-hardening or partial volume effects.

The slight tension between the poles holds them steady against the trunk. Tents stakes wedged in the bark can also be used to level and steady the frame. One end is designated the y axis, and the adjacent side the x axis. Measurements are made with a carpenters tape from the frame to the edge of the trunk and the profile of the trunk shape is plotted.

It is largely composed of cutin, which consists of C 16 - 18 fatty acids. While cutin composition and biosynthesis have been studied, the export of cutin monomers out of the epidermis has remained elusive. Here, we show that DESPERADO (AtWBC 11) (abbreviated DSO), encoding a plasma membrane-localized ATP-binding cassette transporter, is required for cutin transport to the extracellular matrix. The dso mutant exhibits an array of surface defects suggesting an abnormally functioning cuticle. This was accompanied by dramatic alterations in the levels of cutin monomers. Moreover, electron microscopy revealed unusual lipidic cytoplasmatic inclusions in epidermal cells, disappearance of the cuticle in postgenital <b>fusion</b> <b>areas,</b> and altered morphology of trichomes and pavement cells.

In the palatal processes fibronectin and types I and III collagen are distributed throughout the mesenchyme. Fibronectin is present in the basement membrane, while types I and III collagen are localized in a linear, discontinuous fashion beneath the basement membrane. Fibronectin is not observed in the epithelium, including the presumptive <b>fusion</b> <b>areas.</b> In the forelimb bud these components show a similar distribution prior to chondrogenesis (early day 11).

Type II collagen is observed only in chondrogenic regions. The codistribution of fibronectin and types I and III collagen supports in vitro studies which indicate that cells use fibronectin to bind to collagen in the matrix.
