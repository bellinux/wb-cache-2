5|$|As the {{automobile}} {{became more and}} more an extension of the individual, it was natural for this to be reflected in popular culture. America's love affair with {{the automobile}} was most <b>evident</b> in the music of the era.|$|E
5|$|As {{things had}} gone badly for the allies in France, it became <b>evident</b> that some thought {{needed to be}} given to the {{possibility}} of having to resist an attempted invasion of Britain by German forces.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} {{historical}} figure of importance in Finland, historians {{have tried to}} attribute more significance to Thomas than what is <b>evident</b> from the existing sources.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew from {{after the}} Babylonian exile in 587BCE {{is known as}} 'Late Biblical Hebrew'. Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic {{influence}} in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and this trend is also <b>evident</b> in the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.|$|E
5|$|David Stouck, {{professor}} emeritus of English at Simon Fraser University, writes that the Mary Baker Eddy Library holds the original manuscript, and that Cather's handwriting is <b>evident</b> in edits for the typesetter and notes with queries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which are most <b>evident</b> in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly <b>evident</b> in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, {{and that this was}} particularly <b>evident</b> in its use of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} map showing Coatbridge is by Timothy Pont {{published in}} Johan Blaeu's Nether warde of clyds-dail (1654). The districts of Dunpelder, Gartsherrie, Langloan, Kirkwood, Kirkshaws and Whifflet are all <b>evident.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} these riots is still <b>evident</b> in the North 24th Street district, with high numbers of vacant lots and general {{economic}} depression still prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{pressure of}} mechanization <b>evident</b> {{in the newspaper}} and the magazine, {{has led to the}} creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most <b>evident</b> period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Many elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also <b>evident</b> in the surrounding landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most <b>evident</b> period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare bithynian vetch (Vicia bithynica). Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). Elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also <b>evident</b> in the surrounding landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the finale of the Sonata in A major is borrowed from the finale of Beethoven's Piano Sonata, Op. 31, No. 1, as <b>evident</b> through numerous parallels in structural features.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of scale}} armour is <b>evident</b> during the later Mycenaean centuries, as shown on {{iconography}} and archaeological finds. In general, most {{features of the}} later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece.|$|E
5|$|Withington Community Hospital, {{opened in}} 2005, {{occupies}} {{part of the}} site of the former (and much larger) Withington Hospital, developed on the site of a workhouse some of whose buildings are still <b>evident.</b>|$|E
5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is <b>evident,</b> as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim <b>evident</b> through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no <b>evident</b> significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
5|$|As Paul {{became a}} hurricane, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for Baja California Sur from Agua Blanca {{on the west coast}} to La Paz on the east coast. When a weakening trend was <b>evident</b> as the storm turned to the northeast, the hurricane watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning.|$|E
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became <b>evident</b> {{that some of}} the other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are <b>evident.</b> It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|British {{cultural}} {{influence on}} the island is <b>evident</b> in its use of English as the main language and the British pound as its primary currency. Additional cultural commonalities include driving on the left, access to the BBC and ITV regions, a school curriculum following that of England, and the popularity of British sports, including football, cricket and rugby.|$|E
5|$|But when he contested {{the first}} World Championship match in 1886 against Johannes Zukertort, it became <b>evident</b> that Steinitz was playing on another level. Although Zukertort {{was at least}} Steinitz's equal in {{spectacular}} attacking play, Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply {{by the use of}} positional principles.|$|E
5|$|Chambyal (people of Chamba) {{enjoy the}} {{traditional}} folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores {{and these are}} accompanied by various musical instruments. Their love for folk music is <b>evident</b> from their keen interest in folk music which {{is different from that}} of other regions. Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorized as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{bouts of}} illness {{continued}} unabated until his death. The two may have still felt mutual affection, and Isabeau exchanged gifts and letters with {{him during his}} periods of lucidity, but distanced herself during the prolonged attacks of insanity. Adams writes that Isabeau's attachment and loyalty is <b>evident</b> in the great efforts she made to retain the crown for his heirs in the ensuing decades.|$|E
5|$|Confucianism entered Japan from China {{around the}} 5th century A.D., as did Buddhism. Confucian ideals are still <b>evident</b> {{today in the}} Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the {{organization}} of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.|$|E
5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is <b>evident.</b> Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and {{it was hoped that}} as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400/500 models and with a great effort by all, it was soon <b>evident</b> that magnetic tape would have to be used.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{elements}} {{portrayed in}} Independence Day represented a significant {{turning point for}} Hollywood blockbuster films. With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as 1998's Armageddon and Deep Impact. The trend continued throughout the 2000s and 2010s, <b>evident</b> in films like 2004's The Day After Tomorrow and 2012's The Avengers.|$|E
5|$|During the Christmas time, {{locals and}} {{visitors}} visit places around their towns and suburbs {{to view the}} outdoor and indoor displays.

The displays of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also <b>evident.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of Heraclius's life, it became <b>evident</b> that a {{struggle}} was taking place between Heraclius Constantine and Martina, who was trying to position her son Heraklonas in line for the throne. When Heraclius died, he devised the empire to both Heraclius Constantine and Heraklonas to rule jointly with Martina as Empress.|$|E
5|$|During the services, {{the news}} media made note that the {{security}} measures also made <b>evident</b> that the era of terrorism {{that the world was}} experiencing had its roots during the Reagan years. The worst act of terrorism against the United States prior to 9/11, the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 189 Americans, happened during the Reagan years.|$|E
5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were <b>evident.</b> Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Ferens' {{personal}} and religious convictions are <b>evident</b> in other of his parliamentary contributions. He tabled {{a number of}} questions concerning temperance, both at home and in the colonies. His first question in the Commons was about orphan schools. He later asked about railway accidents to children, and about trafficking of young girls in India.|$|E
5|$|He married Edith May Jones and had {{two daughters}} and twin sons, {{both of whom were}} killed in action during the Second World War.
