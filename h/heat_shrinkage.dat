Beef primals were inoculated with Clostridium estertheticum subspp. estertheticum (DSMZ 8809), C. estertheticum subspp. laramenise (DSMZ 14864) and C. gasigenes (DSMZ 12272), and vacuum-packaged with and without <b>heat</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (90 °C for 3 s). These packs were then subjected to immediate chilling in an ice slurry or using conventional blast chilling systems and stored at 2 °C for up to 100 days. The onset and progress of BPS was monitored using the following scale; 0 -no gas bubbles in drip; 1 -gas bubbles in drip; 2 -loss of vacuum; 3 -‘blown’; 4 -presence of sufficient gas inside the packs to produce pack distension and 5 -tightly stretched, ‘overblown’ packs/packs leaking. Rapid slurry chilling (as compared to conventional chilling) did not significantly affect (P > 0. 05) the time to the onset or progress of BPS. It was therefore concluded that rapid chilling of vacuum-packaged beef primals, using an ice slurry system, may not be used as a control intervention to prevent or retard blown pack spoilage.

30|$|In addition, the coupled {{effect of}} {{hydration}} stress, frost heaving pressure and thermal stress {{has a serious}} impact on the deterioration of water-saturated shale. The clay minerals content of the shale is 15.5 % (see Table  2). When the shale is immersed in distilled water, the clay minerals exhibit hydration swelling, which generates the hydration stress inside the shale. The hydration stress mainly concentrates {{at the tip of}} the micro-cracks and bedding planes, which extends these micro-cracks inside the shale and reduces its cohesive force and internal friction force (Liang et al. 2015). Therefore, the interaction between distilled water and clay minerals will cause the shale to undergo seriously secondary micro-damage. During LN 2 cooling, the pore water inside the shale will be transformed into pore ice, which will cause a large amount of frost heaving pressure to squeeze the pore wall. Moreover, the temperature will also cause the <b>heat</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The coupled effect of frost heave pressure and thermal stress will greatly deteriorate the internal micro-structure of the shale. As shown in Fig.  16, the SEM images show the propagation of micro-cracks of water-saturated shale during LN 2 cooling. It is clear that many micro-cracks are induced in the frozen shale due to the coupled effect of ice crystallization pressure and thermal stress. Based on the present experimental results, all mechanical parameters of the saturated and LN 2 -treated samples were lower than those of dry and LN 2 -treated ones. It can be concluded that the coupled effect of hydration stress, frost heaving pressure and thermal stress can further exacerbate the damage of the shale, thus resulting in a much larger reduction in the mechanical properties and an increasing in the permeability.|$|E
40|$|In recent past, tunnel constructions in Japan have {{increased}} mainly {{due to the}} construction of revival road network in Tohoku region in northern part of Honshu Island. Many of the mountainous tunnels constructed in this area utilize New Austrian Tunneling method which has a superior versatility and low initial cost compared to many of other methods. These tunnels are comprised of a double shell lining system. The Inner lining is constructed with shotcrete and the outer lining, which is visible, is made of reinforced or unreinforced concrete. Cracking of the outer, second, lining has become a major concern for tunnel construction specialists as cracking poses a great threat for long term durability. Three types of cracks were apparent from the tunnel inspection data. The first type of cracks referred to type 1 cracks in this research are the cracks which propagate parallel to the crown line close to the crown region. The second type of cracks type 2 cracks are the vertical cracks starting from the horizontal construction joint between the invert and second lining. The third type of cracks, type 3, are the horizontal cracks starting from vertical construction joint between two lining blocks. It had been observed that the mechanism of type 1 cracking was not properly understood because the stress of crown of the second lining could vary based on many variables such as self-weight, volume changes of concrete, hydration <b>heat,</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> restraint conditions of joints etc. Regarding type 2 cracks, the cause of the cracking was hypothesized as the restraint from invert for volume change of concrete in the second lining. However, further clarification of behaviour of type 2 cracks was required to investigate the potential crack mitigation techniques. Three objectives were set for this study. The first objective was to establish appropriate finite element modeling schemes to study stresses generated in the second lining concrete of NATM tunnels mainly caused by short-term thermal movements due to hydration heat and by long-term drying shrinkage. The second objective was to clarify the mechanism of crown stress behaviour as it was crucial to investigate crack mitigation methods at the crown. The third objective was to propose recommendations to mitigate cracking at critical locations. Critical locations considered here included the crown area with high transverse stress and areas of the second lining close to the invert with higher longitudinal stress. The study was carried out for short-term stress behaviour of second lining governed by thermal stress and for long-term stress behaviour of second lining governed by drying shrinkage. The finite element model of the tunnel was calibrated and sufficiently validated using tunnel field measurement data and proper engineering judgement with observed practical evidence. Validated models were utilized for parametric studies to investigate the stress behaviour at the crown and the bottom of the second lining close to invert. Two finite element modeling tools were utilized considering the different capabilities of software in different aspects. Major finite element package used is known as ASTEA-MACS, which is a well-known software in Japan for thermal stress analysis. This software provides a great flexibility to execute parametric studies. The other software is called LINK 3 D, that is, an integrated system which is capable of simulating the combined effects of microscopic material behaviour and nonlinear structural behaviour of concrete structures. Because of the integrated multiscale concrete simulation model in the software LINK 3 D is capable of predicting drying shrinkage with respect to varying environmental conditions, structural geometry and so on. First, finite element modeling was carried out considering the short term stress behaviour of second lining with respect to field measurements. The joint formed by waterproofing sheet and the vertical construction joint in between second lining blocks were modeled with negligible joint strength in shear and in tension where the normal compressive strength was assumed to be non-negligible. The joint between the second lining and invert was modeled with fixed joint conditions. The form removal mechanism was assumed to be equal to the application of gravity load at the time of form removal. Special attention was given in determining the thermal properties of composite waterproofing sheet. The thermal conductivity of the waterproofing sheet was calculated based on previous studies done on geotextiles assuming steady state conditions. It was observed that the established model could simulate the temperature in the second lining and stresses in an acceptable manner. Then to analyze the long-term behaviour of the second lining governed by drying shrinkage, a calculation method was proposed by combining LINK 3 D and ASTEA-MACS software. The free drying shrinkage strain calculated by LINK 3 D was used as an input to ASTEA-MACS to carry out the stress analysis. Considering the stress distribution of the stress in the thickness direction at the crown and close to the invert in the calibrated model, it was observed that the crown cracks can be non-penetrating cracks while the cracks close to invert can be penetrating cracks. From the short term simulation results, the mechanism of crown stress variation was clarified. It could be seen that before the form removal the crown stress was governed only by temperature rise and capability of the free movement due to the existence of air void. After the form removal up to a short time, stress behaviour of the crown was governed by self-weight, temperature decrease rate difference in the thickness direction and the deformation behaviour of second lining at the crown. From the parametric study for short term behaviour, it was observed that crown transverse stress was sensitive to prolonged form retention which could cause external restraint. To obtain the advantages of longer form retention, proper care should be taken {{to make sure that the}} contraction of the second lining is not inadequately restrained. Among the investigated material properties, the coefficient of thermal expansion and autogenous shrinkage had a considerable influence on the longitudinal stress near invert. It was observed that low temperature concreting might be helpful in reducing the invert longitudinal stress but might not affect the crown transverse stress so much. In the current study expansive additive was observed to be effective in controlling the stresses close to the invert but it might be necessary to be further investigated considering the tensile strength of expansive concrete which was not considered in this study. It could be observed that the tensile stress near the surface at crown was small compared to the tensile strength without considering drying shrinkage. This depicts that the crown cracking might not be generated only by thermal stress and self-weight. Therefore, proper construction and ensured material quality might be the key for preventing early age cracking near the crown. In terms of long-term stresses, drying shrinkage governs the stress at the crown. It was observed that shrinkage property of concrete had a considerable effect on crown stress level and should be taken into account carefully. It could be seen that the crown stress was not highly depended on the tunnel section size. Effect of other factors such as concrete creep, air temperature and humidity variation in the long term should be clarified in future to make an accurate conclusion regarding the belief about increased cracking risk in large blocks with evacuation spaces...|$|E

Using the same framework used to understand the imbibition and wetting of the sol-gel in the capillary channels, we developed a mechanism to explain the formation of the double-peak profile. As a model system, patterned Pb(Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48) O 3 thin films were studied. Atomic force microscopic characterization was used to quantify the effect of the rate of gelation on the topography of the patterned thin films. Modifications to the channel mold design eliminate the peak formation, producing more homogeneous patterns that better replicate the features of the mold. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} predict carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) of woods under external heat flux was developed. To improve the modeling accuracy, fire {{processes such as}} water evaporation, volume shrinkage, water and gas transport inside wood slab were considered. Three reactions such as water evaporation, oxidation reactions of virgin wood and char were included. Temperature and moisture dependent thermal properties were used for modeling input. In {{the second part of}} this study, this model was validated by experiments. Comparisons between modeling and experiments showed that mass loss rate and CO release rate can be well predicted for woods under different moisture contents and external <b>heat</b> flux. Volume <b>shrinkage,</b> transport processes of water and gas volatiles inside wood slab were also included. This paper serves as validation and application of a mathematical model in Part I: Theory of a model to predict CO of woods under external heat flux. This model intends to provide a practical tool to predict toxic gases of combustible materials under fire conditions. © 2013 International Association for Fire Safety Science...|$|R
40|$|Concrete with a {{low carbon}} dioxide {{footprint}} (LCDF) contains less cementitious materials (CM) than ordinary concrete and hence less cementitious paste. Besides the reduced carbon dioxide footprint, LCDF concrete offers other advantages such as reduced cost as well as improved dimensional stability due to reduced hydration <b>heat,</b> creep and <b>shrinkage.</b> Nevertheless, decreasing the quantity of CM has {{a negative impact on}} concrete workability. To restore workability, multi-sized fillers are advocated to replace aggregates and CM. Generally, fillers can improve the packing density of concrete due to the filling effect and thus more excess water or paste is available to facilitate spread and flow rate. Two types of fillers were examined in this study – limestone with particles smaller than 75 μm and foundry sand with particles of 75 – 400 μm. The particles of these two fillers are respectively similar and larger in size when compared with cement. Concrete mixes with no fillers and with mono- or multi-sized fillers were prepared and tested for flowability and strength. The results indicate that more superplasticiser is needed to achieve the same flowability when fillers are added. It was also found that, at the same water/CM ratio, fillers can improve concrete strength, and the use of multi-sized fillers can simultaneously improve the flowability and segregation resistance of concrete...|$|R
40|$|DE 10015145 A UPAB: 20011126 NOVELTY - An {{inner sleeve}} (1) {{supplements}} an outer sleeve (2) of {{approximately the same}} length and both sleeves can be tensioned to change their diameter so as to fix the vessel ends radially between them (1, 2). The metal weave of the inner sleeve can be stretched or expanded in a material which returns to its original shape when heated. The outer sleeve (2) is coiled from film and slit lengthways. The outer sleeve can otherwise be reticular or made of shrinkable material and the inner sleeve has an inside structure composed of hooks and/or pins and is pigmented in the center only for heat absorption. The pigments are arranged in a pattern for partial <b>shrinkage</b> under <b>heat.</b> The outside of the inner sleeve is haemocompatibly coated and inner and/or outer sleeve surfaces have embedded medicaments. Heating is by laser beam for preference. USE - Surgical anastomosis. ADVANTAGE - The two sleeves join to give smooth flow and maintained flow section as well as ensured vessel end fixation. Haemocompatibility is sustained and boosted by embedded medicaments to counter thromboses and promote cell growth. Restricted pigmentation favors laser beam <b>heat</b> for film <b>shrinkage</b> and lasting anchorage...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} {{consists}} of both {{the description of the}} formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the Metal Deposition process (MD) and the experimental work carried out at ITP Industry (Industria de Turbo Propulsores, SA, Spain). MD process consists of a manufacturing technology similar to the multi-pass welding used for building features such as bosses and flanges on fabricated components. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is considered including phase-change phenomena defined in terms of latent <b>heat</b> release and <b>shrinkage</b> effects. Temperature evolution as well as residual stresses and distortions due to the successive welding layers are accurately studied coupling the heat transfer analysis together with the mechanical field. The material behaviour is characterized by a thermo-elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model (at macro-level) coupled with a metallurgical model (at micro-level). Nickel super-alloy 718 is the target material of this work. Both heat convection and heat radiation models are introduced to dissipate heat through the boundaries. An in-house developed coupled FE software was the starting point to deal with the simulation and an ad-hoc activation methodology has been implemented to simulate the deposition of the different layers of melted material. Thermo-mechanical results are presented in terms of temperature evolution, residual stresses generated and distortions compared with the experimental data obtained at the MD laboratories of ITP. Difficulties and simplifying hypotheses are discussed. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} the Engineering profession, and {{especially}} the structural field of that profession, has been {{very interested in the}} application of welding to the fabrication of structures. Arc welding has come more and more into use as time has passed, and as confidence in its results increased. Even now, however, large factors of safety are employed due to certain unknown conditions which arise in arc welding. The first of these unknowns is the personal element, the fact that no two welders using the same materials and equipment will obtain exactly the same results. The importance of this factor has greatly decreased with the development of proper welding rod for various types of weld, and with the increased availability of expert welders. The second unknown is the magnitude and importance of stresses developed in the parent metal by welding, due to local <b>heating</b> and to <b>shrinkage</b> on cooling. These stresses are what is known as residual or locked-up stresses, and while they may be practically eliminated in small articles by heat treating, larger articles may be too heavy to support their own weight under sufficient heat treating to reduce the stresses, and of course, such structures as buildings, large hoppers and pressure vessels are too large to be heat treated at all. [ [...] . ] The present work is the first attempt at McGill to evaluate stresses in three directions, that is, longitudinally, transversely, and through the thickness of the plate. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|A coupled finite-element model, CON 2 D, {{has been}} {{developed}} to simulate temperature, stress, and shape development during the continuous casting of steel, both in and below the mold. The model simulates a transverse section of the strand in generalized plane strain as it moves down at the casting speed. It includes the effects of heat conduction, solidification, nonuniform superheat dissipation due to turbulent fluid flow, mutual dependence of the <b>heat</b> transfer and <b>shrinkage</b> {{on the size of}} the interfacial gap, the taper of the mold wall, and the thermal distortion of the mold. The stress model features an elastic-viscoplastic creep constitutive equation that accounts for the different responses of the liquid, semisolid, delta-ferrite, and austenite phases. Functions depending on temperature and composition are employed for properties such as thermal linear expansion. A contact algorithm is used to prevent penetration of the shell into the mold wall due to the internal liquid pressure. An efficient two-step algorithm is used to integrate these highly nonlinear equations. The model is validated with an analytical solution for both temperature and stress in a solidifying slab. It is applied to simulate continuous casting of a 120 mm billet and compares favorably with plant measurements of mold wall temperature, total heat removal, and shell thickness, including thinning of the corner. The model is ready to investigate issues in continuous casting such as mold taper optimization, minimum shell thickness to avoid breakouts, and maximum casting speed to avoid hot-tear crack formation due to submold bulging.
