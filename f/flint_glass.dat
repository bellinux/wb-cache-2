25|$|Lead glass, {{commonly}} called crystal, is {{a variety of}} glass in which lead replaces the calcium content of a typical potash glass. Lead glass contains typically 18–40% (by weight) lead(II) oxide (PbO), while modern lead crystal, historically also known as <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> due to the original silica source, contains a minimum of 24% PbO. Lead glass is desirable owing to its decorative properties.|$|E
25|$|A {{small glass}} {{industry}} existed in Newcastle from the mid-15th century. In 1615 restrictions {{were put on}} the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. Huguenot glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the Ouseburn area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, Sephardic Jewish emigrants from Altare, arrived in Newcastle from Stourbridge and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in collier brigs. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light Baluster'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{refractive}} index {{is dependent on}} the wavelength in every material, some materials have a much more powerful wavelength dependence (are much more dispersive) than others. Crown glasses such as BK7 have a relatively small dispersion, while <b>flint</b> <b>glasses</b> have a much stronger dispersion (for visible light) and hence are more suitable for use in dispersive prisms.

50|$|Apochromatic designs require {{optical glasses}} with special {{dispersive}} properties to achieve three color crossings.

500|$|The Rashtrakuta empire {{controlled}} most of {{the western}} sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade. The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, {{one of the most}} prominent ports in the world at that time.

Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, Italian wines, tin, lead, topaz, storax, sweet clover, <b>flint</b> <b>glass,</b> antimony, gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants.

500|$|Carr Hill by 1820 was {{a modern}} and populous village, {{situated}} on hill, still isolated from Gateshead and Felling. A variety of industries had developed alongside Warburton's pottery and were prospering; a <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturer, under {{the management of}} Alexander Elliot, three corn mills- Carr Hill Mill, Felling Windmill and St John's Mill (the latter built after an earlier mill was destroyed by a mysterious fire in 1824)– and a fire brick kiln. There were also three inns and [...] "some neat houses occupied by respectable families". [...] By 1840 Carr Hill Reservoir had been built and, under {{the management of the}} Newcastle Water Company was the major water supplier for residents in Carr Hill, Sheriff Hill and Windy Nook, and freestone quarries, similar to Kells' Quarry in Windy Nook, were producing Newcastle Grindstone of excellent quality. In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms.

2500|$|The {{reality of}} the {{situation}} was the U.S. Glass trust was formed to [...] "oppose the union and to introduce the automated equipment." [...] The American <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Workers Union was naturally opposed to mechanization or concessions, and it was strong enough that a single glass works could not oppose it. [...] U.S. Glass built two large works (Gas City, Indiana and Glassport, Pennsylvania) that were highly automated—and could oppose unions at the other 16 plants. [...] During the summer of 1892, workers at Factory H were notified that after the summer shutdown, their jobs would be vacant. [...] Those that desired to work at the plant would need to apply to the new factory manager. [...] On October 12, 1893, the American <b>Flint</b> <b>Glass</b> Workers [...] began a strike. [...] Glass was not produced at Factory H, although inventory was still being sold. [...] In January 1894 U.S. Glass proposed that if the workers at its Wheeling plants would accept the terms of the labor agreements used in its Pittsburg plants, work would start immediately. [...] If the conditions were not accepted, then Wheeling's two glass works (including Factory H) would be torn down. [...] The union rejected the proposed terms. [...] Members of the union remained on strike until 1897. [...] U.S. Glass survived by producing glass at its two large (and recently built) highly mechanized plants.|$|E

2500|$|Most common glass {{contains}} {{other ingredients}} {{to change its}} properties.

Leonhard Euler in 1747 had suggested that achromatism might be obtained by the combination of glass and water lenses. Relying on statements made by Sir Isaac Newton, Dollond disputed this possibility (Phil.

50|$|TGG {{has a high}} Verdet {{constant}} {{which results}} in the Faraday effect. The Verdet constant increases substantially as the mineral approaches cryogenic temperatures. The highest Verdet constants are found in terbium doped dense <b>flint</b> <b>glasses</b> or in crystals of TGG. The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength) and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632 nm, the Verdet constant for TGG {{is reported to be}} -134 rad/T·m, whereas at 1064 nm it falls to -40 rad/T·m. This behavior means that the devices manufactured with a certain degree of rotation at one wavelength, will produce much less rotation at longer wavelengths. Many Faraday rotators and isolators are adjustable by varying {{the degree to which the}} amount of the Faraday rotator material is inserted into the magnetic field of the device. In this way, the device can be tuned for use with a range of lasers within the design range of the device.|$|R

2500|$|George Ravenscroft (1618–1681) was {{the first}} to produce clear lead crystal {{glassware}} on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and {{under the auspices of the}} Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand. At first, his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition. He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production [...] moved from his glasshouse in the precinct of the Savoy, London, to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames. In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven’s head seal as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing <b>flint</b> <b>glass</b> containing 30–35% PbO.|$|E
2500|$|Glass has {{the ability}} to refract, reflect, and {{transmit}} light following geometrical optics, without scattering it (due to the absence of grain boundaries).

2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass.

50|$|The Gaussian {{theory is}} only an approximation; {{monochromatic}} or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colors; and should they be compensated for one color, the image of another color would prove disturbing. The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colors are united by an appropriate combination of glasses. If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wavelength, then, {{on account of the}} greater dispersion in the negative components — the <b>flint</b> <b>glasses,</b> — overcorrection will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wavelengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red). This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss. It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be eliminated for two colors, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wavelengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr, Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs).|$|R
