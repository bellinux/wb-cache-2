6000|$|The letter {{which she}} had written to the doctor, announcing her {{willingness}} to receive them, made the boys laugh, although it did not hold out prospects of a very pleasant future. [...] "I am, of course," [...] she said, [...] "prepared to do my duty. No one can say that I have ever failed in my duty. My poor brother quarreled with me. It was his duty to apologize. He did not do so. Had it been my duty to apologize I should have done so. As I was right, and he was wrong, it was clearly not my duty. I shall now do my duty to my niece and nephews. Yet I may be allowed to say that I regret much {{that they are not}} all nieces. I do not like boys. They are always noisy, and not always clean. They do not wipe their shoes, they are always breaking things, they go about with all sorts of rubbish and dirt in their pockets, their hair is always rough, they are fond of worrying cats, and other cruel games. Altogether they are objectionable. Had my brother made up his mind to leave his children in my charge, it was clearly his duty to have had girls instead of boys. However, it is not because other people fail in their duty that I should fail in mine. Therefore, let them come to me this day fortnight. By that time I shall have got some strong and suitable furniture in the room that my nephews will occupy, and shall have time to make other arrangements. This letter will, if all goes well, reach you, I believe, in three days after the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting,</b> and they will take the same time coming here. Assure them that I am prepared to do my duty, and that I hope that they will make a serious effort at doing theirs. Ask my nephews, upon the occasion of their first arrival, to make as little noise as they can, because my cat, Minnie, is very shy, and if she is scared at the first meeting, she will take a very long time to get accustomed to them. I also particularly beg that they do not, as they come up to the house, throw stones at any of the pigeons who may be resting upon the roof, for the slates were all set right a few weeks ago, and I am sure I do not wish to have the slater here again; they were hanging about for ten days the last time they came.

The recent emergence of online environments as new sites for the temporal, spatial and social expansion of death and mourning (Brubaker and Hayes 2011; Brubaker, Hayes and Dourish 2013) has attracted scholarly interest in digital post-death rituals of mourning and memorialisation as an important social phenomenon (Walter et al. 2011; de Vries and Roberts 2004). While previous studies have been largely based on content analyses of individual MySpace logs and Facebook or discussion forum posts, the present study approaches digital memorial posts as entextualised moments of mourning shared with and for a networked audience (John 2013; Androutsopoulos 2014). The article analyses a corpus of Facebook memorial posts (N= 525) as post sequences, wall events and texts, looking at how content on the site is produced, shared and discursively regimented. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the intextualisation of moments of mourning on Facebook is participatory: it involves users’ selection of moments for public display relating to offline ceremonies of mourning, calendar-important dates or personal updates and contributing to the production of a textured wall in memory of the dead. The textuality of posts is found to rely on an ad hoc blending of formal genres of mourning and vernacular genres of writing dependent on (i) situational (<b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting</b> activity, position in the post sequence) and (ii) extra-textual parameters (gender of poster, relationship with the deceased). The present socio-discursive investigation contributes to the growing, in-depth understanding of the texture and textuality of Web 2. 0 mourning practices...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} {{the internal and external}} validity of the Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), a brief measure of subjective memory complaint in people with normal cognitive function. Study Design and Setting: The Study of Health Outcomes in Aircraft Maintenance Personnel was a retrospective cohort study investigating the association between aircraft fuel tank deseal/reseal activities and health status in Royal Australian Air Force personnel. Cross-sectional comparison tests included measures of executive functioning, psychomotor speed, attention/working memory, new learning/memory, depression, and anxiety. An adjusted regression analysis accounted for confounders including age, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting,</b> rank, education, alcohol use, tobacco use, and affective status. Results: Eight hundred seventy-nine participants completed the MAC-Q. Although the MAC-Q tested as highly reliable and internally valid, it was highly associated with affective status and was only associated with Digit Symbol Coding after adjustment for depression/anxiety. Conclusion: The MAC-Q is greatly influenced by affective status but not memory performance. It is probably not useful as a specific screen of memory complaint for general population research.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{consists}} of an edition of four versions of RCL from the following manuscripts: MS Auchinleck, Advocates 19. 2. 1; MS Arundel 58, College of Arms; MS Egerton 2862, British Library; MS Douce 228, Bodleian Library, which are printed {{side by side in}} vol. 1. The text is accompanied by a full critical apparatus consisting of an Introduction, Notes, Glossary and Index of Names. The Introduction gives a description of the four manuscripts, discusses the affiliation of the four versions - with reference to the texts not printed where necessary - and deals with the language of the original text and that of the four versions. The dialect, style and use of historical sources indicate that the text of RCL, as found in ADEL, is made up of a core part, which originated in the South East, and at least nine interpolations. Internal evidence points to a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>post</b> 1250.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study to determine}} the feasibility and cost effectiveness of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done in Ndanda and Morogoro (the peripheral hospitals) and Muhimbili the national referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All patients with breast lump(s) who presented at the surgical outpatient clinic(s) or surgical ward(s) in these three hospitals were studied from November 1993 to August 1995. Fine needle aspiration smears from the peripheral hospitals, were posted to Muhimbili for staining and interpretation by the pathologist. The surgeons followed these patients with open tissue biopsies. For Muhimbili patients aspiration {{was done in the}} pathology cytology laboratory by the pathologist, whereas tissue biopsies were sent to the laboratory by the surgeons after operation. For both smears and tissue biopsies, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting</b> from peripheral hospital, receiving (taking in, in case of tissue biopsies) at the pathology laboratory, making diagnosis and getting cytology or histology report by the surgeon were noted by the author in each patient through collaboration with the surgeons. Th~ mean number of days taken for each procedure was calculated from the day of aspiration or operation. iii A total of the 256 FNAC paients were studied, of these 206 (80. 5 %) were from Muhimbili, 41 (16. 0 %) from Morogoro and 9 (3. 5 %) were from Ndanda. Of the 256 FNAC patients, 86 (33. 6 %) had traceable tissue biopsies. Results showed that compared to tissue biopsies FNAC significantly reduced the mean number <b>of</b> days in <b>posting,</b> receiving specimens at the laboratory, making diagnosis and getting report. seventy three (28. 5 %) patients who had adequate cytological material and had histological follow up, were analyzed to assess the accuracy of FNAC compared to histological diagnosis. FNAC was found to be a highly accurate method in diagnosis of palpable breast masses with an accuracy of 95. 8 %, sensitivity of 94. 8 % and specificity of 97. 0 %. Cost effectiveness analysis indicated that FNAC was highly cost effective, reducing the cost of diagnosing breast masses in peripheral hospitals by 63. 3 % and 60. 2 % for one outpatient and inpatient respectively. The respective cost reduction at Muhimbili referral hospital were 70. 4 % and 65. 7 % for one outpatient and inpatient. Therefore FNAC provides a rapid, accurate and cheap method of accurately diagnosing breast lumps.

40|$|Baseline {{coronary}} artery calcification (CAC) accurately identifies coronary atherosclerosis and might improve prediction of future cardiac events. Serial assessment of CAC scores {{has been proposed}} for monitoring atherosclerosis progression and for assessing the effectiveness of medical therapies aimed at reducing cardiac risk. However, whether knowledge of progression of CAC scores over time further improves risk prediction is unclear. Several trials relating medical therapies to CAC progression have been performed without any formal guidelines on the definition of CAC progression {{and how it is}} best quantified. We conducted a comprehensive review of published reports on CAC progression. Increased CAC progression is associated with many known cardiac risk factors. We found that CAC progression correlates with worsening atherosclerosis and may facilitate prediction of future cardiac events. These findings support the notion that slowing CAC progression with therapeutic interventions might provide prognostic benefit. However, despite promising early data, such interventions (most notably with statin therapy) have not been shown to slow the progression of CAC in any randomized controlled trial to <b>date,</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>post</b> hoc subgroup analyses. Thus, routine quantification of CAC progression cannot currently be recommended in clinical practice. First, standards of how CAC progression should be defined and assessed need to be developed. In addition, there remains a need for further studies analyzing the effect of other cardiac therapies on CAC progression and cardiac outcomes...|$|R
