Together, McLachlan, Rena, and McNeill devised a plan whereby he and Isa's boyfriend, John Trotter, would secretly drive to Bishop's Cleeve in McLachlan's [...] and discreetly whisk Rena, {{her children and}} McNeill back to Scotland. McFall had by this stage become infatuated with Fred, who had promised to marry her. It is likely she informed Fred of this plan, as not only did <b>he</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the pre-scheduled arrival time, but McFall was [...] "oddly calm" [...] as she informed McNeill she intended to remain with Fred to work as the children's nanny. An altercation ensued between Fred and McLachlan, resulting in Fred being struck several times. Police were called and McLachlan, Trotter, McNeill, and Rena left, with Fred threatening to kill Rena should he ever see her again.|$|E
2500|$|Some of his patrons claimed divine descent, such as Diagoras of Rhodes, but Pindar {{makes all}} men akin to gods if they realize their full potential: their innate gifts are divinely bestowed, {{and even then}} success still depends on the gods' active favour. In honouring such men, therefore, Pindar was honouring the gods too. His {{statements}} about life after death were not self-consistent but that was typical for the times. Traditional ambivalence, as expressed by Homer, had been complicated by a growth of religious sects, such as the Eleusinian mysteries and Pythagoreanism, representing various schemes of rewards and punishments in the next life. However, for the poet, glory and lasting fame were men's greatest assurance of a life well-lived. He presents no theory of history apart from the view that Fortune is variable even for the best men, an outlook suited to moderation in success, courage in adversity. Notions of 'good' and 'bad' in human nature were not analysed by him in any depth nor did <b>he</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> anything like the compassionate ethics of his near contemporary, Simonides of Ceos. His poems are indifferent to the ordinary mass of people. They are dismissed with phrases such as [...] "the brute multitude" [...] (Pythian Ode 2.87). Nor are the poems concerned with the fate of rich and powerful men once they lose their wealth and social status (compared for example with the bitter and disillusioned poems of Theognis of Megara). They {{are more interested in}} what successful men do with their good fortune: success brings obligations, and religious and artistic activities need patrons.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, somewhere {{from the}} Himalayas, a rider starts his journey leaving his dear ones and Malu, {{heading for the}} village. <b>He</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the small {{roadside}} stall where the boy works, stopping for a tea. Like the others present, Guppy, gets prejudiced with the unconcerned lifestyle of a rider, for people here strive hard to subsist. Gaps in communication and probably his biased views, offend the individual with the tea hence given. The experience ends on a bad note for the two, with both their egos getting hurt. Little did Guppy know the rider was here to stay, for he is Er. Thejus Varkey in charge of building the bridge. A near miss accident the next day give Guppy his upper hand and the teen gang loot the engineer for damages, when there actually is none.|$|E

40|$|This article {{intends to}} quest for an {{opportunity}} of post-positivist sociology {{by focusing on the}} French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu`s intellectual production and addressing the point on which historical basis Bourdieu`s sociological perspective is established. In this context, {{in the first part of}} the article, it is going to be pointed out by which movements (successively structuralism, interactionism and pragmatism) criticizing does <b>he</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the scientific understanding that tries to overcome the tension between objectivism which looks down on the social and subjectivism which accepts individuals` quotidian life and ideas without questioning. This, in other words, means a construction of a new scientific language becoming hybridized between the structuralist terminology and the phenomenological attitude and damaging the main backbone of mainstream sociology. Bourdieu`s understanding of sociology, whose works are also being read as an eternal argument against positivism, empiricism, structuralism, existentialism, phenomenology, economism, Marxism, methodological individualism and grand narratives, provides a new point of view by criticising subjective and objective forms of knowledge and the essentialist perspective of reality. The concept of habitus being the crucial notion of this Bourdieu based innovative thought is also going to be dealt with in terms of an opportunity of post-positivist sociolog...|$|E
