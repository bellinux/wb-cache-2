40|$|Kenya's National Malaria Strategy {{states that}} insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) would be {{considered}} as a free service to pregnant women assuming sufficient financial commitment from donors. In 2001, United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Kenya brokered support to procure and distribute nets and K-O TABs (deltamethrin) to 70 000 pregnant women in 35 districts throughout Kenya around Africa Malaria Day. This intervention represented the single largest operational distribution of ITN services in Kenya to date, and this study evaluates its success, limitations and costs. The tracking process from the central level through to antenatal clinic (ANC) facilities suggests that of the 70 000 nets procured, 37 206 nets (53 %) had been distributed to pregnant women throughout the country within 12 weeks. One-fifth of the nets procured (14 117) had gone out to individuals other than pregnant women, most of these {{at the request of the}} district teams, with only 2870 nets estimated to have gone astray at the ANC facilities. At 12 weeks, the remaining 18 677 nets were still in storage <b>awaiting</b> <b>distribution,</b> with more than two-thirds having reached the district, and nearly half already being held at ANC facilities. The cost of getting a net and K-O TAB to an ANC facility ready for distribution to a pregnant woman was US$ 3. 81. Accounting for the 14 117 nets that had gone to other users, the cost for an ITN received by a pregnant woman was US$ 5. 26. Delivering ITNs free to pregnant women through ANCs uses an existing system (with positive spin-offs of low delivery cost and simple logistics), is equitable (as it not only targets those who can afford it) and can have the added benefits of strengthening ANC service, delivery and use...|$|R
60|$|In {{this valley}} was congregated the motley populace {{connected}} with the fur trade. Here the two rival companies had their encampments, with their retainers of all kinds: traders, trappers, hunters, and half-breeds, assembled from all quarters, awaiting their yearly supplies, and their orders to start off in new directions. Here, also, the savage tribes {{connected with the}} trade, the Nez Perces or Chopunnish Indians, and Flatheads, had pitched their lodges beside the streams, and with their squaws, <b>awaited</b> the <b>distribution</b> of goods and finery. There was, moreover, a band of fifteen free trappers, commanded by a gallant leader from Arkansas, named Sinclair, who held their encampment a little apart from the rest. Such was the wild and heterogeneous assemblage, amounting to several hundred men, civilized and savage, distributed in tents and lodges in the several camps.|$|R
40|$|A protein {{specifically}} binding a symmetrically methylated DNA {{fragment of}} the first intron of the mts 1 gene was studied. The protein was purified by gel filtration and affinity chromatography. Mass spectrometry showed that the protein is Kaiso, a new member of the BTB/POZ family. To study the association with methylated DNA sequences in vivo, the location of Kaiso in NIH 3 T 3 cells was analyzed. Immunofluorescent staining with polyclonal antibodies against Kaiso showed that the protein is predominantly associated with the nucleoli. The causes of its <b>distribution</b> <b>awaits</b> further investigation. The zinc-finger domains of Kaiso were {{for the first time}} demonstrated to specifically recognize symmetrically methylated DNA sequences in vitro. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Kelly was {{actively}} involved in two major capital case prosecutions while serving as a legal officer, that of Saddam Hussein and, in Somalia, the warlord Hussan Gutaale Abdul. Gutaale, who among many other things had attacked and killed 16 aid workers and repeatedly driven an armoured car into emaciated refugees <b>awaiting</b> food <b>distribution,</b> was arrested by an Australian patrol, held in a cage at Baidoa airport and later flown to Mogadishu to be held by US forces. He {{was found guilty of}} 31 counts of murder by a panel of three judges and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour. Appeals were immediately made, with the prosecution demanding the death penalty mandatory for murder under the Somali Penal Code. A panel of six judges heard the appeal, upheld the previous verdicts and imposed the sentence of death to be carried out forthwith. [...] "The court errupted in mayhem" [...] and Gutaale physically attacked Kelly. Eventually a group of engineers arrived, Gutaale was handcuffed and Kelly wrestled him along the roadway to his place of execution. Gutaale was handed over to the Somali police and executed on the spot. Kelly later recalled: ...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{understand}} the current distributions {{of plants and animals}} require both historical and ecological information. Phylogeography has proved highly effective in elucidating historical events such as postglacial colonisations in north temperate zones. However, interesting questions still <b>await</b> resolution. Lusitanian <b>distributions</b> of fauna and flora in western Europe, for example, have puzzled biogeographers for more than 150 years. Lusitanian species have highly disjunct distributions in Ireland and in Iberia, often with few or no other populations inbetween. Despite much debate, no agreed explanation for Lusitanian distributions has yet emerged. We investigated the phylogeographic structure of one Lusitanian species, the natterjack toad Bufo calamita, using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and allelic variation at eight microsatellite loci. Our results show that this amphibian must have survived in north European refugia, as well as in Iberia, during and since the last (Weichselian) glacial maximum around 20, 000 years before present (BP). Subsequent local recolonisation after the Younger Dryas cooling around 11, 000 years BP best explains the Lusitanian aspect of natterjack toad distribution...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{potentials}} in {{the outer}} plasmasphere range from near zero to + 5 to + 10 V. Under such conditions ion measurements may not include the low energy core of the plasma population. In eclipse, the photoelectron current drops to zero, and the spacecraft potential can drop to near zero volts. In regions where the ambient plasma density is below 100 cm- 3, previously unobserved portions of the ambient plasma distribution function can become visible in eclipse. A survey of the data obtained from the Retarding Ion Mass Spectrometer (RIMS) on Dynamics Explorer 1 shows that the RIMS detector generally measured the isotropic background in both sunlight and eclipse in the plasmasphere. Absolute density measurements for the "hidden " ion population are obtained {{for the first time}} using the Plasma Wave Instrument observations of the upper hybrid resonance. Agreement in total density is found in sunlight and eclipse measurements at densities above 80 cm- 3. In eclipse, agreement is found at densities as low as 20 cm- 3. The isotropic plasma composition is primarily H+, with ~ 10 % He+, and 0. 1 to 1. 0 % 0 +. A low energy field-aligned ion population appears in eclipse measurements outside the plasmasphere, which is obscured in sunlight. These field-aligned ions can be interpreted as field-aligned flows with densities of a few particles per cm 3, flowing at 5 - 20 km/s. The problem in measuring these field-aligned flows in sunlight is the masking of the high-energy tail of the field-aligned distribution by the isotropic background. Effective measurement of the core of the magnetospheric plasma <b>distributions</b> <b>awaits</b> satellites with active means of controlling the satellite potential...|$|R
50|$|Trapped {{underneath}} a dome in Metropolis, Bruce Wayne of Pre-Zero Hour {{is attempting to}} get through the criminal underworld where he even offers his fortune to Tobias Whale of New-Earth. In order to prove that Bruce Wayne is worthy, Tobias Whale sends one of his underlings to do the job. That underling is Jean-Paul Valley who warns Bruce to take it easy with his broken back. Bruce explains that he was drawn to Metropolis by the transformation of Green Lantern into Parallax. Unfortunately, he lingered too long, and ended up trapped beneath the dome. When Tobias Whale started getting too close to taking over food distribution, he couldn't let it slide. Obviously, Jean-Paul has the same idea of taking him down with an inside job. Jean-Paul is unsure he wants to ally with Bruce, given their disagreement on how best to handle crime, but goes along with it. For the sake of convincing Tobias Whale, though, he has to beat Bruce quite brutally. After making it look convincing, Jean-Paul brings Bruce to Tobias Whale. who is unconvinced though. Tobias Whale suggests that Bruce can prove himself if he uses his political pull to learn the route by which the food is transported to distribution services, given that it changes with every transport. At Metropolis City Hall, Bruce and Jean-Paul pay a visit to councilman Erasmus Hall, leaning on him to give up the route. Jean-Paul's methods are cruel and Bruce does nothing to stop him. Before long though, they have delivered the route to Whale. Unfortunately, Whale has a further task for Bruce: kill Erasmus Hall and tie up that loose end. He grins though admitting that it was a joke. He already had his people kill Hall and make it look like a suicide. Bruce has to keep his cool as news coverage shows Hall's wife and children grieving him. Two days later, Bruce Wayne and Jean-Paul Valley are in their Batsuits <b>awaiting</b> the food <b>distribution</b> to come their way. When they both leap onto the truck, Tobias Whale's SUV pulls up in front of it. As Bruce prevents Jean-Paul from killing Tobias Whale's henchman Nikka, a voice is heard stating that the dome will fall as the champions from the other areas will need to fight for their survival. Jean-Paul knocks out Tobias Whale as some beings from another world are shown watching the action.|$|R
