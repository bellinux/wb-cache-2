5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. <b>For</b> <b>visual</b> tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E

5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>visual</b> course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>visual</b> localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E
5|$|It {{was placed}} on the Top Ten lists of several critics, with Roger Ebert giving it four stars, and listed it as 2005's eighth best film. The film {{received}} four Academy Award nominations, <b>for</b> <b>Visual</b> Effects, Sound Mixing (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, Hammond Peek), Sound Editing, and Production Design, winning all but the last. Entertainment Weekly called the depiction of Kong the most convincing computer-generated character in film in 2005. Some criticized the film for retaining racist stereotypes that had been present in the 1933 film, though it was not suggested that Jackson had done this intentionally.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Victor B.2s {{had been}} {{converted}} for Strategic Reconnaissance missions following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity. In service, this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas, capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific. Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> reconnaissance; however, it {{was found to be}} cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970. Subsequently, radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type's role. The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place.|$|E

5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for Best Score Soundtrack <b>for</b> <b>Visual</b> Media at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012.

In the 2011 Scream Awards, the film received a total of 14 nominations, and won in the Best Scream-Play, Best Fantasy Actor (Daniel Radcliffe), Best Villain (Ralph Fiennes), Best F/X, and Holy Sh*t scene of the Year categories.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E

5|$|The most {{expensive}} film {{made up to}} that point with a budget of $55 million, Superman was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success; its worldwide box-office earnings of $300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. Reviewers particularly praised Reeve's performance. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound Mixing, and received a Special Achievement Academy Award <b>for</b> <b>Visual</b> Effects. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film's legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood's superhero film franchises.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development and thus probably important <b>for</b> <b>visual</b> communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E
5|$|A violent multiple-vortex tornado struck {{portions}} of extreme northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee during the mid-evening hours of April 27. It touched down along Davis Ridge Road in Catoosa County, Georgia, and {{moved through the}} town of Ringgold at EF3 strength, destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Baymont Inn & Suites, located near Interstate 75 was partially destroyed by the tornado, along with a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and several gas stations located on Highway 151 in Ringgold at the Interstate 75 interchange (exit 348). The Catoosa County Department of Family and Children Services and other businesses on Nashville Street in downtown Ringgold were also heavily damaged. The Kellerhals Center <b>for</b> <b>Visual</b> Arts Education at Ringgold High School was destroyed (RHS itself had minor damage), and Ringgold Middle School was heavily damaged.
