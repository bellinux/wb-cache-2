The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{perinatal}} outcomes of gestational diabetic patients with normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose level < 5. 3 mmol/L, versus impaired <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose level ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L on 100 g oral glucose tolerance results. All gestational diabetic patients enrolled in the study were diagnosed by standard 100 g oral glucose blood samples. Based on oral glucose tolerance results, patients were divided into two groups according to the <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose; Group 1 normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose < 5. 3 mmol/L, and Group 2 impaired <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L. During the study period, a total of 292 patients were identified as having gestational diabetes mellitus. One hundred eighty-two (62. 3 %) were with normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose < 5. 3 mmol/L and 110 (37. 7 %) patients had impaired <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L. The percentage of total and primary cesarean delivery and the arithmetic means ±SD of all <b>fasting</b> and postprandial <b>plasma</b> glucose measurements were significantly lower in-Group 1 compared with Group 2 patients.

We investigated whether normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose levels (< 5. 60 mmol/l) are associated with decreases in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, as well as an adverse cardiovascular profile in obese youth. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a multiethnic sample of 1, 020 obese youth (614 girls and 406 boys; mean age 12. 9 years [CI 95 % 12. 7 - 13. 1], BMI z score 2. 34 [CI 95 % 2. 31 - 2. 38]) with normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose. All participants had a standard OGTT, with calculation of indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. For the analysis, prepubertal and pubertal participants were stratified into quartiles of normal <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose. We observed a significant increase in fasting insulin and AUC 2 h glucose across quartiles. Pronounced changes were observed in insulin sensitivity and secretion, particularly in the pubertal group. Moreover, the odds of presenting with impaired glucose tolerance increased by 4. 5 % with each 0. 06 mmol/l increase in <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose. No significant differences in cardiovascular indices were seen across quartiles.

Forty hypertensive males and 15 healthy male subjects underwent anthropometric and echocardiographic evaluations, assessment of insulin sensitivity through euglycemic glucose clamp combined with indirect calorimetry, and determination of <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> leptin concentration. <b>Fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> leptin levels were higher in hypertensives than in controls (6. 48 +/- 2. 9 versus 4. 62 +/- 1. 5 ng/mL, P< 0. 05); these results were unchanged after adjustment for body mass index (P< 0. 05). In the whole group of patients (n= 55), <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> leptin concentration was correlated with body mass index (r= 0. 46, P< 0. 001) and waist/hip ratio (r= 0. 50, P< 0. 001); independent of body mass index and waist/hip ratio, <b>fasting</b> <b>plasma</b> leptin concentration was correlated (n= 55) with whole-body glucose disposal (r=- 0. 27, P< 0. 04), interventricular septum thickness (r= 0. 34, P< 0. 001), posterior wall thickness (r= 0. 38, P< 0. 003), and the sum of wall thicknesses (r= 0. 68, P< 0. 001).

40|$|The main {{challenge}} for the Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostic on the TEXTOR tokamak is the detailed study of <b>fast</b> <b>plasma</b> events at a high spatial resolution and a high repetition rate of the measurements.

40|$|The magnetospheric {{substorm}} {{is a major}} {{process that}} explosively releases {{the stress of the}} Earth's magnetotail field exerted by the solar wind and produces spectacular auroral activity in the polar region (a. k. a. Auroral substorm [1]). The triggering of substorms is a half-century old issue in space physics. There are two major competing substorm hypotheses: one that triggered by local (~ 10 RE from the Earth's center) plasma instabilities [2] and one that triggered remotely by earthward <b>fast</b> <b>plasma</b> flows launched by near-Earth reconnection (~ 20 – 30 RE) [3]. Because <b>fast</b> <b>plasma</b> flows can generate north-south (N-S) aligned auroral streamers [4], it is possible to determine onset triggering using auroral images, although such an attempt has not been shown successfully in the past. Here, we search for evidence of reconnection-triggered substorm by taking the advantage of unprecedented high-quality global auroral images acquired by the Ultraviolet Imager [5] on board the NASA Polar satellite. It is found that a minor portion (~ 9 %) of 570 surveyed onset events were found to be associated with auroral streamers, inferring a reconnection-triggered scenario.
