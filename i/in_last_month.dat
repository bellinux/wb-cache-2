40|$|International audienceObjective To {{examine the}} impact of {{oncologist}} awareness of palliative care (PC), the intervention of the PC team (PCT) and multidisciplinary decision-making on three quality indicators of end-of-life (EOL) care. Setting Cochin Academic Hospital, Paris, 2007 – 2008. Design and participants A 521 decedent case series study nested in a cohort of 735 metastatic cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy. Indicators were location of death, number of emergency room (ER) visits <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of life and chemotherapy administration in last 14 days of life. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between indicators and oncologist's awareness of PC, PCT intervention and case discussions at weekly onco-palliative meetings (OPMs). Results 58 (11 %) patients died at home, 45 (9 %) in an intensive care unit or ER, and 253 (49 %) in an acute care hospital; 185 (36 %) patients visited the ER <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of life and 75 (14 %) received chemotherapy in last 14 days of life. Only the OPM (n= 179, 34 %) independently decreases the odds of receiving chemotherapy in last 14 days of life (OR 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 2 to 0. 9) and of dying in an acute care setting (0. 3, 0. 1 to 0. 5). PCT intervention (n= 300, 58 %) did not independently improve any indicators. Among patients seen by the PCT, early PCT intervention had no impact on indicators, whereas the OPM reduced the odds of persistent chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life. Conclusion Multidisciplinary decision-making with oncologists and the PCT is the most critical parameter for improving EOL care...|$|E

40|$|Background. Guidance {{is limited}} on best {{measures}} and time periods to reference when measuring pain {{in order to}} predict future function. Objective. To examine how different measures of pain predict functional limitations a year later {{in a sample of}} rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using baseline and one-year data (n= 262). Pain intensity in the last 24 hours was measured on a 0 – 10 numerical rating scale and in the last month using an item from the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS 2). AIMS 2 also provided frequency of severe pain, pain composite scores, and patient-reported limitations. Physician-rated function was also examined. Results. Composite AIMS 2 pain scale performed best, predicting every functional outcome with the greatest magnitude, a one-point increase in pain score predicting 21 % increased odds of limitations (combined patient and physician report). However, its constituent item—frequency of severe pain in the last month—performed nearly as well (19 % increased odds). Pain intensity measures <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> and last 24 hours yielded inconsistent findings. Conclusion. Although all measures of pain predicted some functional limitations, predictive consistency varied by measure.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{validity}} and reliability of the Oral Health Impact Profile- 14 (OHIP- 14) and the Child Oral Health Impact Profile (COHIP) for investigating oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) of adolescents. Method: We studied 234 adolescents from two publicly funded schools in Hamedan, Iran. Participants completed questionnaires and had a clinical examination. We compared convergent and discriminative validity of the instruments by analyzing their association with self reported health indicators and number of decayed teeth. Results: Both instruments showed good convergence with self-rated health and self-rated oral health. Those who perceived dental treatment needs, who had experienced dental pain <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> were more dissatisfied with their oral health, or had more decayed teeth scored higher on both OHIP- 14 and COHIP. The discriminative validity of the two instruments varied slightly and inconsistently. The convergent and discriminative validity of both instruments were established independent of their scoring methods. Conclusion: Both the OHIP- 14 and COHIP were valid and reliable measures for investigating OHRQoL among 15 - 17 year old adolescents. The COHIP is preferable when the aim is identifying more impacts. Both measures have shown good convergent and discriminative validity, however, for practical reasons; the shorter instrument (OHIP- 14) may be more suitable for epidemiological studies...|$|E

There is a strong positive correlation between the onset of smoking in adolescents and young adults, and exposure to media and movies which shown consumption of smoking. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the views of the people of Yazd, Iran on the impact of visual media on the prevention and incidence of smoking among adolescents and young adults. Materials and methods: This was a descriptive (cross-sectional) study. Participants were 582 individuals living in the city of Yazd. The self administrative questionnaire was used which validity and reliability was measured. After completing the questionnaires, the data was analyzed with using SPSS Version 16. Results: Based on participants' view role of family, friends and media respectively were more important in tendency of teenagers and adolescents smoking users. Almost 80 percent of subjects showed that influence of smoking in the media on a positive attitude towards tobacco smoking among adolescents and young people was very high. More than 55 % of participants confirmed that the lack of smoking in movies is not effective in quality of the films. It was also confirmed, that <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> advertisements and anti-smoking programs were not seen by participants. Conclusion: The present study suggest control and monitoring on media, limitation or lack of smoking on media and films is an important factor to decreasing and control of smoking in adolescents and young adults...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that survey {{methodology}} can greatly influence prevalence estimates for alcohol and illicit drug use. The aim {{of this article is to}} assess the effect of data collection modes on alcohol misuse and drug use reports by comparing national estimates from computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and audio-computer-assisted self interviews (A-CASI). Methods: Design: Two national representative surveys conducted in 2005 in France by CATI (n = 24, 674) and A-CASI (n = 8, 111). Participants: French-speaking individuals aged [18 – 64] years old. Measurements: Alcohol misuse according to the CAGE test, cannabis use (lifetime, last year, 10 + <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month)</b> and experimentation with cocaine, LSD, heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy, were measured with the same questions and wordings in the two surveys. Multivariate logistic regressions controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (age, educational level, marital status and professional status) were performed. Analyses were conducted on the whole sample and stratified by age (18 – 29 and 30 – 44 years old) and gender. 45 – 64 years old data were not analysed due to limited numbers. Results: Overall national estimates were similar for 9 out of the 10 examined measures. However, after adjustment, A-CASI provided higher use for most types of illicit drugs among the youngest men (adjusted odds ratio, or OR, of 1. 64 [1. 08 – 2. 49] for cocaine, 1. 62 [1. 10 – 2. 38] for ecstasy, 1. 99 [1. 17 – 3. 37] for LSD, 2. 17 [1. 07 – 4. 43] for heroin, and 2. 48 [1. 41 – 4. 35] fo...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Sixty gynecological cancer patients were assessed for their nutritional status using BMI, serum albumin, hemoglobin, percentage weight lost in last 1 month, and scored PG-SGA. Correlation, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the former four parameters compared to scored PG-SGA were calculated. Results: 88. 33 % of cases were at risk of or had some degree of malnutrition according to scored PG-SGA. Serum albumin level ≤ 2 g/dl had highest specificity and positive predictive value at 1, whereas percentage weight lost <b>in</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> had better overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0. 5833, 0. 9444, 0. 875, and 0. 7727, respectively. The Pearson′s correlation coefficient between scored PG-SGA and percentage weight lost in last 1 month was 0. 784, highest among all the parameters. Conclusion: 88. 33 % of gynecologic cancer cases had some degree of malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition. Approximate percentage weight lost in last 1 month, that is, ≥ 5 % may be used in place of the comprehensive scored PG-SGA to triage the patients in case the latter is not used for some reason.
