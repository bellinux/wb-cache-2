5|$|Germany {{gradually}} {{tightened the}} grip of Norwegian society, and the Parliament became defunct {{during the rest of}} the German occupation of Norway. In 1941 Meisdalshagen became a prominent figure in the Norwegian resistance movement against German rule, in the position of district leader of Milorg in Valdres. In 1944 he left Norway and fled to Sweden, where he was a secretary at Flyktningskontoret in Stockholm until 1945. Briefly in 1945 he served as an advisor <b>in</b> <b>London</b> <b>for</b> the coordination of Milorg cells.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Cambridge University, {{where he was}} awarded his Blue. He then spent nine seasons playing for Somerset, and captained the side {{for the last five}} of those seasons. Working as a schoolmaster at Highgate School in London from 1876–1884, his playing opportunities for the south-western county were limited, and from 1885 he only played first-class cricket at Lord's, representing Middlesex in three matches that season, and appearing for the MCC on nine occasions over six years. He returned to play for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 when they had lost their first-class status. He worked as headmaster of Loudon House School <b>in</b> <b>London</b> <b>for</b> some years from 1888, and died following an operation in 1916 in Ipswich.|$|E

5|$|The Heiress {{had been}} a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part {{that he decided to}} play it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper's {{daughter}} Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson's favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was not up to the task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion from the recent traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to go before the first performance, the producer, Binkie Beaumont, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran <b>in</b> <b>London</b> <b>for</b> 644 performances.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic {{programme}} changed {{only slightly}} {{from that of}} the 1948 St. Moritz Olympics, with the addition of women's cross-country skiing, and changes to the alpine skiing line-up where the combined was replaced by the giant slalom. Bandy was held as the sole demonstration event at the Games. Both men and women participated at these Games; aside from cross-country skiing, women also took part in alpine skiing and figure skating. The Games were officially opened by a woman for the first time; Princess Ragnhild of Norway did the honours in the absence of both her father Crown Prince Olav and grandfather King Haakon VII, away <b>in</b> <b>London</b> <b>for</b> the funeral of George VI of the United Kingdom who had died just days before the Games opened.|$|E
