40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>food</b> <b>flavoring</b> of `koi-hoi', a popular Thai snail dish, on the {{viability}} and infectivity of Angiostrongylus (= Parastrongylus) cantonensis third-stage larvae was assessed in a mouse model. Groups of 50 each of actively moving, non-motile coiled, and extended larvae were obtained from experimentally infected snail meat, after one-hour exposure to standard `koi-hoi' flavoring. These larvae and groups of 50 unexposed moving larvae (control) were individually fed to each group of three experimental BALB/c mice. The effect on Angiostrongylus worm burden was measured after 3 weeks of infection. infectivity of the motile larvae after exposure to `koi-hoi' <b>food</b> <b>flavoring</b> was 38 +/- 5. 29 %. This was highly {{significantly lower than the}} infectivity (62 +/- 7. 21 %) of the control (unexposed) third-stage larvae (chi(2) = 17. 28, P < 0. 001). In the non-motile larvae resulting from exposure to the <b>food</b> <b>flavoring,</b> no adult worm was recovered from the extended larvae, indicating that they were no longer alive and unable to cause infection. A small proportion (3. 33 +/- 2. 31 %) of the coiled larvae developed into young adult worms, indicating that mobility alone is not a definitive indicator of viability. The present study confirms that the <b>food</b> <b>flavoring</b> components of `koi-hoi' dish adversely affect the viability and infectivity of A. cantonensis larvae. Exposure of the third-stage larvae to `koi-hoi' <b>food</b> <b>flavoring</b> resulted in decreased viability and eventually death. Prolonged treatment with <b>food</b> <b>flavoring</b> to inactivate/immobilize and then kill the infective, third-stage larvae of A. cantonensis in snail meat prior to consumption {{may be one of the}} possible economical means of reducing human infection.

A number of pharmaceutical companies have proposed various physical means of deterring such illicit uses namely by altering the method of drug delivery.
