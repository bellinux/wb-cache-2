5|$|Born in Kiev {{in the old}} Russian Empire, Kistiakowsky fled his {{homeland}} during the Russian Civil War. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Germany, where he earned his PhD in physical chemistry {{under the supervision of}} Max Bodenstein at the University of Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1926, where he joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1930, and became a citizen in 1933.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1919, Towner {{attended}} an investiture ceremony {{in the ballroom}} of Buckingham Palace, during which he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Military Cross by King George V. Three weeks later he boarded HT Karagola, bound for Australia. Disembarking at Sydney on 14 June 1919 <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Brisbane, and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 August 1919.|$|E

5|$|Captain Robert L. Cardenas, USAAF, {{served as}} a B-24 {{aircraft}} pilot in the European Theater of Operations with the 506th Bombardment Squadron. He was awarded the Air Medal and two oak leaf clusters for bombing missions before being shot down over Germany in March 1944. Despite head wounds from flak, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to Allied control. On October 14, 1947, Cardenas flew the B-29 launch aircraft that released the X-1 experimental rocket plane in which Charles E. Yeager became {{the first man to}} fly faster than the speed of sound. Cardenas retired as brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Saudi Arabia, {{where he}} set himself up {{as a painter}} and electrician, {{and worked as a}} casual laborer for Aramco. He {{remained}} close to his mother; his brother told Melman that Abu Nidal would return to Nablus from Saudi Arabia every year to visit her. It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. The couple had a son and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Stiller {{attended}} The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine {{and graduated}} from the Calhoun school in New York in 1983. He started performing on the cabaret circuit as opening act to the cabaret siren Jadin Wong. Stiller then enrolled as a film student at the University of California, Los Angeles. After nine months, Stiller left school {{to move back to}} New York City. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through acting classes, auditioning and trying to find an agent.|$|E

5|$|By March, however, Brooks' {{unit had}} grown to 110 men and he was {{promoted}} to Second Lieutenant and put in charge of a band of 40 soldiers, including Duncan. His guerrilla activities expanded to include larger raids, reprisal attacks, and the assassination of more important members of the Nazi regime. He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the Russian front line in January 1945, and was eventually transferred from Lviv to Odessa, Port Said, Cairo, and finally London, where he arrived in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} as <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|During a {{subsequent}} confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, Armidale {{was struck by}} two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot {{down one of the}} Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E
60|$|Three minutes {{afterward}} her {{preparations for}} Grandcourt's indifference were all canceled. Turning her head after some remark to her mother, {{she found that}} <b>he</b> had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up to her.|$|R

5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at {{the confluence of the}} Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|James Abbott McNeill Whistler {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on Whistler.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{attended}} {{private schools}} in Kiev and Moscow until the Russian Revolution {{broke out in}} 1917. He then joined the anti-Communist White Army. In 1920 he escaped from Russia in a commandeered French ship. After spending time in Turkey and Yugoslavia, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Germany, where he enrolled at the University of Berlin later that year. In 1925, he earned his PhD in physical chemistry {{under the supervision of}} Max Bodenstein, writing his thesis on the photochemical decomposition of chlorine monoxide and ozone. He then became Bodenstein's graduate assistant. His first two published papers were elaborations of his thesis, co-written with Bodenstein.|$|E
50|$|After {{publishing}} a book describing his exploits and ultimate falling {{out with the}} KGB, Shvets was banned from foreign travel. In 1994, <b>he</b> secretly <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to America where he now resides.|$|R
50|$|Prica {{started his}} footballing {{career as a}} youth player for Ljungby, <b>he</b> then <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into the first team, making 37 {{appearances}} and scoring 14 goals, {{over a period of}} three seasons.|$|R
60|$|Malchus went {{round to}} the {{principal}} entrance, and after a little badinage from the officer on guard as to the lateness of the hour at which <b>he</b> returned, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to <b>his</b> apartment.|$|R
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Russians. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.|$|E
5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that {{was responsible for}} the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
50|$|Born in Palmerston North, Taylor {{originally}} {{came out}} of the town of Ashhurst, just out of Palmerston North and attended the local school. <b>He</b> possibly <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into Palmerston North as he grew older.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Up-stairs, sir,’ {{said the}} boy, just {{opening the door}} wide enough to let Parsons in without {{squeezing}} him, and double-locking it the moment <b>he</b> had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through the aperture—‘First floor—door on the left.’ ...|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} I {{was not very}} anxious to look him up, but I {{followed}} the boarder, as <b>he</b> slowly <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> toward the kitchen door. As we opened the door we instinctively stopped.|$|R
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Much of Morgan's {{early life}} is unknown. He {{was born in}} south Wales, {{but it is not}} known how <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the West Indies, or how he {{began his career as a}} privateer. He was {{probably}} a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s. Morgan became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica. When diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave Morgan a letter of marque, a licence to attack and seize Spanish vessels. Morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto Principe (now Camagüey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (in modern Panama). In 1668 he sailed for Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. He raided and plundered both cities before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the occupying authority in Norway started cracking down harder on opposition. A strike over milk rations in September led to the arrest and execution of the two labour leaders Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm. This was followed by several high-profile arrests – among them Einar Gerhardsen – and Lie had to flee the country. He left his house only hours before the Germans appeared to arrest him. From Sweden <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the United Kingdom, where {{he worked as a}} propaganda secretary for the exiled Norwegian labour movement in London. He made two visits to the United States to gather support and financial aid, the first time he went from New York City to Seattle where he held a series of lectures and radio-interviews before he travelled through Canada from the west- to the east coast. The second trip was as a labour attaché with diplomatic status. While Haakon was in exile, his brother Per, who was also a labour activist, was arrested in Norway in 1942. He was imprisoned and eventually sent to Dachau, where he died from typhoid fever in March 1945.|$|E
50|$|Taya was on {{the plane}} back to Mauritania when the coup happened, forcing him to land in Niger. <b>He</b> {{eventually}} <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Qatar, and {{now works as a}} teacher at a Qatar military school.|$|R
