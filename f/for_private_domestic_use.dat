40|$|ISBN 978 - 92 - 893 - 3855 - 4 (EPUB) This report {{summarizes}} experiences from Phase I in a Nordic {{project on}} food redistribution through food banks and direct redistribution, {{as well as}} giving an overview of laws and regulations on the area. The project was initiated by the Nordic Council of Ministers {{as part of the}} Nordic Prime Ministers’ green growth iniatiative, The Nordic Region – leading in green growth, with budget from the Food and Agriculture program. The project has focused on redistribution of food that has been donated to prevent food waste, which means that ordinary sponsored food, either free of charge or to a very low price, is not included. The main goals of this study and the report has been to: - Give an overview and evaluation of the extent and potential effects of food redistribution in the Nordic region, both via food banks and more direct and local redistribution. - To summarize the legal basis for regulation and control with food redistribution in the Nordic countries. - To evaluate to what extent it has been harmonized or if it is regarded as important barriers to development of food redistribution. There are few studies and little scientific data on food redistribution in a waste prevention perspective. Some new references to studies in the UK and Australia were found interesting through this study. Food banks are not a well-defined concept in present literature. In this report we have limited the concept of food banks to specific organisations that have been set up to function as open redistribution centres and where several stakeholders collaborate in establishment and operation. Matsentralen in Norway, fødevareBanken in Denmark and Allwin in Sweden fits within this definition, with a question mark on how the stakeholders are involved in the operation of Allwin. Redistribution of food has been divided into two main approaches: - Redistribution from food supply chain donors via redistribution centres like food banks, for storage and further distribution to end users which typically are charity organisations (the typical “food bank redistribution route”). - Direct redistribution from food supply chain donors to charity organisations, which is typical for local redistribution. Another important part of the project has been to compile available information about laws and regulations in the Nordic countries that can be potential barriers to establishment and operation of food banks and food redistribution in general. The main methodology applied {{in the second part of}} the project has been to carry out surveys by questionnaires to key persons in the involved organisations, both in national food banks, national charity organisations, local charity organisations and food donators, in many cases followed up by interviews either by telephone or through physical meetings. The report gives an overview of both food legislation in the EU as well as nationally. Within the European Union food legislation is harmonized. Since 2002 the Union has a general food law; Regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (hereafter regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002). The regulation constitutes the basis for the union food legislation and shall apply to all stages of production, processing and distribution of food and feed. It shall not apply to primary production <b>for</b> <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>use</b> or to the domestic preparation, handling or storage of food for private domestic consumption. Food banks should be regarded as food business operators according to regulations, and should thus follow the same overall rules as other types of businesses in the food supply chain. However, the four Nordic countries included in this study have defined food banks different with regard to the role in the supply chain, which can give quite different situations with regard to what is accepted and what is not to be redistributed. As far as possible the role of food banks could be harmonised in the Nordic countries. Direct food redistribution is in many cases not specifically mentioned in the survey of regulatory measures, making it unclear how national regulations and rules relates to charity organisations getting food directly from the food supply chain. This should be clarified and harmonised as far as possible. The three food banks that exist in the Nordic region have quite different backgrounds and also quite different models for organisation and ownership. The founding process of the three food banks was also quite different. The Danish and Swedish food banks have been established and developed in a continuous process, whereas the Norwegian food bank was established after two years with planning. The three food banks have also developed quite different business models, where the Swedish one is a private limited company, the Danish one a membership organisations with more than 300 members and the Norwegian one a cooperative organisations mostly owned by the national charity organisations, but also with a number of members. All three food banks were established with a two-sided purpose, both to reduce food waste and to make it easier for charity organisations to get access to food donations. The three food banks do also differ with regard to number of employees and volunteers, which is quite natural taken the length of operation into consideration. The three food banks redistributed in 2013 about 900 tonnes of food, that otherwise would have ended as food waste. The number of meals served based in redistributed food has been estimated to about 1. 67 mill in 2013, with about 926, 000 in Copenhagen, 346, 000 in Oslo and 400, 000 in Gothenburg. The most important donors to the food banks today are food producing companies and to some extent wholesale companies, and mainly from the surrounding area of the cities where the food banks are located. In general, there have not been problems with the quality of food being donated, as the regulations on this are the same as for normal food distribution. The problem is more to receive fairly stable amounts of food and to have a sufficient variety of food types. The food banks do both have capacity to receive more food and there is a need for more food for redistribution, so there is potential for increase in redistribution in the future. The main lessons learned from this brief overview of food banks in Nordic countries are that they are a small, but important actor in food waste prevention. It is important to consider the role for food security for low-income people, which gives redistribution a double role in the society. Food banks must find their role between the food sector and charity organisations, to supplement and not compete with the existing systems for redistribution locally. The food banks could also take the roles as “system operators” for redistribution of donated foods and be national competence centres for all actors being involved in food redistribution. Food banks can also have roles in certification of actors being involved in redistribution of food, which should be further discussed in Phase II of the project. The food banks struggle with low incomes and low support from national authorities; it is thus important to consider how the food banks should be financed. National surveys were carried out based in a common research approach and with the same questionnaires applied in all countries. As this survey is the first attempt to get an overview of direct food redistribution in any Nordic country, it should be regarded as a pilot study where the objectives were both to establish a methodology for the survey as well as getting a first overview of the extent of food redistribution outside the “official” food banks. 2 – 4 cities/regions were included in each country, where the cases were selected in collaboration with national charity organisations. The survey indicated that locally organised direct redistribution makes a significant contribution to prevention of food waste and to social security for low income people in all countries. This does not mean that it will contribute to a big reduction in total amounts of food waste in each country, nor that a large proportion of low-income people will be served with redistributed food. For the weaker groups, this is the most important service of the charity organisations, and donated food makes up more than 50 % of served food in most organisations. The figures are still quite uncertain and the regions studied are not representative for the whole country. Finland seems however to have a much better organized and a much higher number of serving places for low income people than the other countries. Food redistribution has a long tradition in most countries, but is still relatively loosely organised by local relationships and direct contacts between persons in the charity organisations and food companies/retail companies. Central agreements between organisations and food and retail companies would certainly have made it easier to establish and manage local and direct redistribution. A main barrier mentioned by the local organisations is lack of resources to establish and maintain a system for receiving food donations. One way to better facilitate food redistribution from food producers and retailers to local charity organisations is by providing access to monetary and human resources for the purpose of establishing and maintaining local systems for receiving food donations. This system also needs to include infrastructure such as storage and cooling facilities as well as solutions for transportation of food from the donor to the organisation. The main findings from direct redistribution of food in the Nordic countries, based in the regional studies carried out shows that the average number of meals served per year per 1, 000 inhabitants varies between 217 and 335, whereas the number of food bags delivered per 1, 000 inhabitants varies between 17 in Sweden and 522 in Finland. Those figures should be used carefully, since the calculations are based in a number of uncertain conditions which are discussed in the report. Our pilot survey of direct redistribution indicates that direct redistribution today have a much larger volume than the amount of food being redistributed via food banks alone. The study also indicates that it can be a great potential for increasing the amount of food being redistributed in the Nordic countries from the present status, and most of the charity organisations say there is a need for more food donations. Better organisation and clear guidelines from food authorities nationally can make it more acceptable for the food industry and retail companies to donate food, and realise the big potential for redistribution. This survey has shown that there are significant differences in how food redistribution activities are organised in the Nordic countries, and that there are many models for how it can be organised. Food redistribution lack a systems organisation in the Nordic countries and there could be developed a good model that integrate the food banks operating on national and regional levels with local direct redistribution initiatives. There are several areas that are important to be followed up through more specific studies, either as a direct following up from this pilot study or eventually in other similar settings, in the Nordic region or on a European scale. The three areas that have been described and that are proposed as input to discussions for Phase II of the Nordic Food Waste project are: - Following-up study on the quantification of food redistribution in the Nordic region, both via food banks nationally and regionally and direct redistribution locally. - Development of food banks as “system operators” in food redistribution, with regional networks and good collaboration with local direct redistribution systems. - Further development of rules and control routines for both redistribution via food banks and especially for directly to charity organisations within the given EU regulations.

This {{publication}} is an {{output of}} the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation ([URL] Queensland University of Technology. It is axiomatic in the international copyright arena for the law to impose criminal liability on secondary acts of copyright infringement. Such acts of infringement (which may also attract civil liability) typically entail the commercial exploitation of infringing copies of copyright material by unlicensed vendors. Take, for example, the ubiquitous street vendor in Bangkok’s hugely-popular Patpong district who, on a daily basis, hawks pirated CDs and DVDs to throngs of foreign tourists. Although street scenes such as these are fairly commonplace and representative of the livelihoods of numerous other unlicensed vendors the world over, the law clearly frowns upon such practices and, for some time now, has imposed penal sanctions on these secondary infringers of copyright. 1 The use of the criminal law under such circumstances {{to aid in the}} effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is understandable, because the sale of each unauthorised copy of music, film or software will, correspondingly, deprive the relevant copyright owner of the economic benefits of a legitimate transaction. Yet the fact remains that many of these so-called copyright pirates have continued to operate under the present legal environment simply because of high consumer demand; there is, after all, a sizeable global market for illegitimate products of intellectual property. The irony, of course, is this: that whilst it is a criminal offence to trade in illegitimate copies of copyright material, it is – at least under copyright law – not a crime nor an actionable civil wrong to purchase or acquire such copies <b>for</b> <b>private</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>use.</b> 2 However, in light of the rapid advancements in computer, digital and Internet technologies, consumers and other end-users have begun to take things into their own hands. Instead of purchasing illegitimate copies of copyright material from the street vendor, they now discover that it is far more efficient and cost-effective to acquire digital copies for themselves {{in the privacy of their}} own rooms from certain Internet websites or through peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file-sharing networks. They may further decide to share these digital copies with others in the Internet or P 2 P file-sharing community. In the process, however, they inadvertently expose themselves to civil action for having committed primary acts of copyright infringement, and, in Singapore at least, they may also face criminal prosecution if primary infringers like themselves are found guilty of wilful infringements of copyright. Against this backdrop, the authors will, in this paper, examine the newly introduced criminal provisions in Singapore’s copyright legislation which target primary acts of copyright infringement and will consider, in particular, the consequences of prosecuting offenders pursuant to these provisions in the context of a number of hypothetical scenarios involving acts of infringement committed on the Internet. These Internet-based scenarios are particularly relevant and timely in the present discussion in light of recent reports in the local media concerning – (1) the various measures taken by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (and other local agencies) to encourage all companies and businesses to use legal or licensed software in the conduct of their day-to-day business; as well as (2) the recent arrest and prosecution of two individuals in Singapore for allegedly distributing unauthorised music files via an Internet chat program. 3 This paper therefore aims to offer an academic perspective of the various types of online activity which, in the authors’ view, will likely attract criminal liability under the new provisions (as well as those which ought not to) ...|$|R

30|$|I am {{interested}} {{to know if the}} patterns for the average firm is universal among ownership types or is it specifically driven by a particular organizational structure. I split the above analysis to separately study <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> firms and <b>private</b> foreign firms. I find that the average effect is replicated <b>for</b> <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> firms. The variance of κ increased from 0.308 to 0.400 whereas the variance of the firm earnings decreased from 0.387 to 0.232. The sorting factor also decreased. However, for firms that are partially or wholly owned by foreign private entrepreneurs, I find the opposite. Recall that for these firms, we do not observe the inverted u-shaped pattern in 3 and there is a secular increase in inequality for these firms. The variance of κ increased from 0.139 to 0.214 and variance of δ increased from 0.134 to 0.441 for these firms. This suggests that the ownership structure seems to be an important element that characterizes the unique wage variance structure in Ghana.|$|R

Ideas of 'tradition, cultural authenticity' & 'cultural difference,' as well as 'femininity,' are embedded & negotiated in daily recruitment & training practices. On the one hand, domestic work is constructed by both trainers & recruiters in relation to the idea of migrant women's 'cultural predisposition' to take on caring roles. At the same time, national identities are constructed in terms of family ties or domestic service relations. On the other hand, in their interactions with Italian recruiters, trainers & employers, migrant women challenge these racializing representations of domestic work relations.

I run OLS regressions similar to Mincerian equations and decompose the variance components to find that the decline in earnings inequality is consistent with decline in variance of firm-level earnings whereas variance of predicted wage from worker characteristics have increased. I also find suggestive evidence of changing patterns of worker-firm sorting which contributes to the decline in inequality.

40|$|Elements of the {{institutional}} framework, i. e., {{the rules and regulations}} of the economy and the institutions that enforce them, are the main long-run criteria <b>for</b> <b>private</b> investment decisions.

Against the background of Ukraine’s still rather poor institutional framework, specifically targeted investment incentives for pre-defined sectors, regions, and/or types of investment, can be both costly and ineffective. Leaning towards selective targeting, the draft law does not sufficiently serve to sustainably enhance private investment in the long run. We recommend to consistently re-draft the law to represent Ukraine’s Guidelines for Public Support of Private Investment, in line with private investor preferences and international experience. Compared to the first draft, we specifically suggest: to focus on improvements of {{the institutional}} framework and eliminate all specific targeting elements from the law; to eliminate all references to public investment from this draft law, which should concentrate on public support <b>for</b> <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> and foreign investment; not to revert to state aid in order to support private investment activity; to expand the final provisions of the draft law and explicitly mention supplementary legislation necessary to improve the institutional framework for investment in Ukraine. In particular, we recommend to focus on the adjustment of the tax legislation according to international standards, employment standards, and provisions that define property rights, to improve law enforcement, the transparency of the public sector, and the efficiency of public spending by cutting state aid. This would serve to demonstrate that institutional framework reforms need a broad and concerted effort from all sources of legislative action. ...|$|R

Applying the prevailing bargaining framework in studies on ownership structures of FDI projects, we find that a more liberal institutional environment <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>private</b> firms is associated with less foreign ownership of the joint ventures operating there. Several mechanisms can contribute to this outcome. One is that a more liberal institutional environment may enhance the bargaining power of those domestic firms negotiating with foreign firms to form alliances (the capability effect). The other mechanism is that a more liberal institutional environment may reduce some of the auxiliary benefits associated with FDI - such as greater property rights granted to foreign investors - and thereby attenuate incentive to form alliances with foreign firms (the incentive effect) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{new state}} firms created {{in this period}} {{established}} a significant share of public ownership in the modern sector of the economy. By 1975 they accounted for over half of mining output and a fifth of industrial output. One set of estimates indicates that enterprises under state ownership came to account for a higher share of value added than <b>domestic</b> <b>private</b> capital: 26 percent of GDP for the state firms, compared with 22 percent <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>private</b> firms. The share produced by foreign-owned firms dropped to 8 percent from 21 percent prior to the Velasco government's reforms.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between modernisation and changes in domestic service in the 20 th century, drawing upon the author’s own research and some results of the other papers presented to the Forum. A century ago, several intellectuals thought that progress would imply the decline of domestic service. Indeed, in the following years this was generally the case. Yet in many countries the 1930 s were characterized by {{a reversal of the}} trend that in some cases coincided with a further feminisation of domestic staff. To explain the inter-war transformation of domestic service, the paper mainly focuses on Italy, Germany, Spain and Sweden. Whilst Italian, Spanish and German women had to face regimes which emphasised their domestic role, Swedish women debated how to combine work and family. In the following decades, the development of the welfare state in Northern Europe offered a solution to this problem and meant a big {{reduction in the number of}} domestics. Their number declined in Spain and Italy, too, but to a lesser extent, probably because in these countries care was mainly provided by the family. However, ageing of the population, increasing female employment and insufficient public services are currently leading to a widening demand <b>for</b> <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> services both in Northern and Southern Europe, while the increasing imbalance between rich and poor (or impoverished) countries means there is plenty of cheap migrant labour on offer that satisfies this demand and, possibly, also stimulates it. We are therefore experiencing a “resurgence” of paid domestic work. This resurgence is also due to state policy aimed at fighting unemployment and the informal economy through the expansion of so-called ‘proximity services’...|$|R
40|$|Creating a {{favourable}} investment {{climate is}} crucial for economic development. In this study, we explore the impact of social development variables on FDI and <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> investment, <b>using</b> panel data from 75 countries for the period 1989 - 2000. Our results show that reducing corruption leads {{to an increase in}} domestic investment. Though we do not find a significant impact of corruption on FDI, previous studies have established a similar relationship for FDI. Thus there is evidence to suggest that combating corruption can have a beneficial effect on both domestic and foreign investment. Our results indicate that improvements in political rights and civil liberties tend to increase FDI. In contrast, political freedom appears to {{have a negative effect on}} domestic investment. However, other studies suggest that democratization has a positive impact on corruption, which makes the total effect of political freedom on domestic investment ambiguous. A few other social development variables are found to have an impact on one of the two types of investment. Religious tensions appear to deter FDI, but have no impact on domestic investment. In addition, socioeconomic conditions could affect domestic investment through savings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{apparent}} contradictions between two strands {{of the literature}} on the effects of financial intermediation on economic activity. On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of financial depth as measured by, <b>for</b> instance, <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> credit and liquid liabilities. On the other hand, the banking and currency crisis literature finds that monetary aggregates, such as domestic credit, are among the best predictors of crises and their related economic downturns. This paper accounts for these contrasting effects based on the distinction between the short- and long-run effects of financial intermediation.

40|$|Theoretical {{explanations}} {{appear in}} sharp contrast concerning the determinants of demand-driven industrial business cycles. Aggregate factors are likely to differentiate cyclical fluctuations for a given industry across countries. Industry-specific factors are likely to differentiate cyclical fluctuations across industries of a given economy. The differences are evaluated using data <b>for</b> industries producing <b>private</b> <b>domestic</b> output across a group of major industrial countries. Aggregate factors dominate industryspecific factors in explaining industrial cyclical fluctuations in response to aggregate demand shifts. Consistent with the various explanations, higher variability of aggregate demand moderates the response of industrial output to aggregate demand shifts across countries. Contrary to {{the implications of the}} new classical imperfect information model, cyclical fluctuations in industrial output appear also smaller in response to higher trend price inflation across countries. Business cycles appear, therefore, to be highly correlated across industries within countries. ...|$|R
