2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> (later models feature a polymer <b>guide</b> <b>rod)</b> resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, {{the mass of the}} slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, <b>guide</b> <b>rod,</b> and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19 iwb holster.|$|E
2500|$|Since its inception, the M1911 has lent {{itself to}} easy customization. [...] Replacement sights, grips, and other {{aftermarket}} accessories {{are the most}} commonly offered parts. [...] Since the 1950s {{and the rise of}} competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the external finish, checkering the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes. A common modification of John Browning's design is to use a full-length <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight {{to the front of the}} pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble. Custom guns can cost over $5000 and are built from the ground up or on existing base models. The main companies offering custom M1911s are: Springfield Custom Shop, Ed Brown, STI International, Nighthawk Custom, Wilson Combat, and Les Baer. IPSC models are offered by both Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms) and STI International.|$|E

40|$|Soft tissue {{reaction}} following metallic debris formation {{with the use}} of <b>guided</b> growing <b>rod</b> system has not been previously reported in human. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report complications caused by metallosis in a <b>guided</b> growing <b>rod</b> system. A 9 -year-old female patient, who underwent treatment for the progressive idiopathic scoliosis (with Cobb's angle of 71 °) with the <b>guided</b> growing <b>rod</b> system. Her Cobb's angle was corrected to 13 ° with the index surgery. During the 5 years postoperative period, she manifested recurrent episodes of skin irritation and progressive worsening of lateral curvature of the spine to an angle of 57 °. Furthermore, at her final followup, Risser stage 4 with a gain in height of 26. 4 cm was achieved. Considering adequate growth attainment and deterioration in the curvature, revision surgery with fusion was performed. Postoperative Cobb's angle of 23 ° was achieved with the final correction. During the revisional surgery, signs of implant wear and metallosis were observed at the location of the unconstrained screws. On histological evaluation, chronic inflammation with foreign body granules was seen. However, titanium level in the body was within normal range. She was discharged without any complications. More research on implant wear as a complication in the <b>guided</b> growing <b>rod</b> system is necessary before its widespread use. The occurrence of metallosis {{with the use of}} <b>guided</b> growing <b>rod</b> system in growing young children should be considered, when designing the implants...|$|R

5000|$|The gas {{cylinder}} is offset {{to the right}} side of the barrel and works with one of the two guide rods. The AUG uses a short-stroke piston system where the right <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> serves as the action rod, transmitting the rearward motion of the gas-driven piston to the bolt carrier. The left-hand rod provides retracting handle pressure when connected by the forward assist and can also be used to remove fouling in the {{gas cylinder}} by utilizing the left-hand <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> as a reamer. The firearm uses a 3-position gas valve. The first setting, marked with a small dot, is used for normal operation. The second setting, illustrated with a large dot, indicates fouled conditions. The third, [...] "GR" [...] closed position is used to launch rifle grenades (of the non-bullet trap type).|$|E

50|$|For {{over two}} centuries {{this work was}} used in Europe as a basic {{artillery}} manual. Its pyrotechnic formulations were used for over a century. The book provided the standard designs for creating rockets, fireballs, and other pyrotechnic devices. It discussed {{for the first time}} the idea of applying a reactive technique to artillery. It contains a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for military and civil purposes), including multistage rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with delta wing stabilizers (instead of the common <b>guiding</b> <b>rods).</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} for measuring peak wind speeds under {{severe environmental conditions}} is described, comprising an elongated cylinder housed in an outer casing. The cylinder contains a piston attached to a longitudinally movable <b>guided</b> <b>rod</b> having a pressure disk mounted on one projecting end. Wind pressure against the pressure disk depresses the movable rod. When the wind reaches its maximum speed, the rod is locked by a ball clutch mechanism {{in the position of}} maximum inward movement.

50|$|Tipu {{distributed}} {{copies of}} his military manual to all of his officers. In the manual he defined 200 men to handle rockets {{within each of the}} Mysore cushoons, with 16 to 24 cushoons of infantry. The personnel handling the rockets were trained to define the launch angle to properly affect the curve at which the rocket would land. Tipu also defined in the manual a multiple rocket launcher (much like a musical organ) that would launch up to 10 rockets. Some of the rockets had blades {{in the front of the}} bamboo <b>guiding</b> <b>rods,</b> while others were designed as incendiary rockets.|$|R
50|$|The P9RC is the {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the P9R. There are 3 notable differences: the <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> assembly, the bottom part of the barrel (on which the tilting barrel locking system works) and the grips. Earlier P9Rs had wooden grips, later ones came with plastics as well, while P9RCs were made with plastics only.|$|E
50|$|It {{features}} an exposed hammer, a traditional double-action trigger mechanism, a single-column magazine, and a fixed barrel that also {{acts as the}} <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> for the recoil spring.

5000|$|Nearly any [...]45 ACP pistol can be {{converted}} to utilize the [...]400 Cor-Bon cartridge with only a drop-in replacement barrel, and sometimes a heavier recoil spring (for 1911s this is usually an 18-20 lb. spring, although a few need a 22-24 lb. spring). Suitable recoil springs are easily installed when changing barrels and readily available from many gun parts suppliers, including Wolff Gunsprings. There is no need to buy new magazines, <b>guide</b> <b>rods,</b> or change extractors. Feed reliability with this cartridge improves with very stiff magazine springs, particularly in 1911 style pistols, as too light a magazine spring can cause nose dive jams when the magazine is fully loaded.|$|R
