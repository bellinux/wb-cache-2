In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House. Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.|$|E
500|$|A {{report in}} 1538, by Richard Yngworth, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, {{describes}} the warden of the friary as [...] "stiff". The warden also held office in Richmond and Yngworth {{went on to}} say [...] "yet for all his great port, I think him twenty marks in debt, and not able to pay it." [...] Six remaining friars surrendered the property to Ingworth and it was dissolved. The precinct was leased to one Jeremy Green for a total annual rent of 20 shillings and 8 pence. In 1541, Henry VIII granted the friary, together with other dissolved houses, to the Mayor and Commonalty of Bristol for a [...] "consideration of £1,000 cash and a yearly <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> rent of £20". The Mayor had earlier petitioned the king, saying [...] "The Grey Friars of Bristol is of the foundation ... of the town, built by ancient burgesses at their cost; we should like it to repair the walls and quay and to make a wharf." ...|$|E
50|$|Morgan was {{increasingly}} active in this parliament, his legal skills used in reviewing and redrafting proposed legislation. In {{the second session}} of the parliament, during 1548-9, he was given responsibility for the bill for <b>fee</b> <b>farms</b> of cities and towns. This was {{an important part of}} the monarchy's legislative programme, proposing to release <b>fee</b> <b>farms</b> for three years: Gloucester's had been fixed at £60 in 1489. In the last session, in 1552, he and Robert Broke were given a bill for leases to scrutinise.|$|R

500|$|The estates of the Earls of Northumberland had {{traditionally}} been in constant {{use as a}} source of manpower and wages in defence of the border since the Percy family first gained the office the previous century. The wages assigned to the third Earl were substantial: £2,500 yearly in time of peace, and £5,000 during war, as well as an annual payment for the maintenance of Berwick's upkeep (£66 in peacetime and £120 in wartime). Percy often had to provide from his own resources, however, as [...] "securing payment was not easy" [...] from the Exchequer, (for example, in 1454 he received no payments at all). In July 1452 he gained a twenty-year fee-farm (£80 yearly, from Carlisle), although he subsequently lost it in favour of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, in July 1454. Throughout the 1450s, the Crown continually made efforts at paying Percy his Warden's wages and fees promptly (paying him full wartime rates for the whole of the year 1456-7, for example), and since he was a loyal Lancastrian he achieved this more often than his counterpart on the west march, Salisbury, who by now had publicly aligned himself with York. The <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> of Carlisle was returned to Percy in November 1459, following Salisbury's attainder in Coventry. He also benefited from the attainder of York, being granted an annuity of £66 from the latter's forfeited Wakefield Lordship in Yorkshire; he also received £200 from the profits of Penrith.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 November {{the king}} granted the abbey site to Cavendish in <b>fee</b> <b>farm.</b> A year later, {{the site was}} sold to James Leveson ( [...] ), a rich Merchant of the Staple from Wolverhampton. The Levesons were closely {{associated}} with St Peter's Collegiate Church, and James Leveson had made some of his fortune by leasing the church's deanery {{and many of its}} prebendal lands. He sent choir stalls from the abbey to the church, where they can still be seen, now used as seating in the lady chapel. In 1543 Leveson bought the entire manor of Lilleshall from the Crown, creating a country estate for his family. He probably built or started the building of a lodge close to the abbey site as a family home. Leveson died in 1547, leaving the manor and the abbey to his son, Richard.|$|E
60|$|Tregony is {{upon the}} same water {{north-east}} from Falmouth--distance about fifteen miles from it--but {{is a town}} of very little trade; nor, indeed, {{have any of the}} towns, so far within the shore, notwithstanding the benefit of the water, any considerable trade but what is carried on under the merchants of Falmouth or Truro. The chief thing that is to be said of this town is that it sends members to Parliament, as does also Grampound, a market-town; and Burro', about four miles farther up the water. This place, indeed, has a claim to antiquity, and is an appendix to the Duchy of Cornwall, of which it holds at a <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> rent and pays to the Prince of Wales as duke 10 pounds 11s. 1d. per annum.

50|$|The {{etymology}} of King's Lynn is uncertain. The name Lynn {{is said to}} {{be derived}} from the body of water near the town: the Celtic word llyn, means a lake; but the name is plausibly of Anglo-Saxon origin, from the word lean, implying a tenure in <b>fee</b> or <b>farm.</b> As the Domesday Book mentions many saltings at Lena (Lynn), an area of partitioned pools or small lakes may have existed there at that time (1085). The salt may even have contributed to Herbert de Losinga's interest in the modest parish.|$|R

50|$|The first Parliament of Edward VI {{lasted for}} most of the reign, and Broke was {{automatically}} returned to it. His aldermanic colleague was the goldsmith Sir Martin Bowes, who had just served his term as Lord Mayor, having made so large a fortune at the Royal Mint that he was able easily to afford the £10,000 to settle accounts when he and the other masters were found to have systematically debased the coinage. Bowes remained a London MP throughout Broke's term, apart from a short break in 1553. The first session of the parliament definitively abolished chantries. A major concern of the London members in the second and subsequent sessions of the parliament was to ensure that the City did not lose control of the wealth of the chantries within its boundaries to the king. Broke, who had been appointed commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, during an earlier and abortive move toward abolition, must have had first-hand knowledge of the subject. The London members also wrestled with an Act to release <b>fee</b> <b>farms</b> for three years to ensure that London got the best terms from it. Broke was told to work closely with one of the burgesses, who had specialist knowledge of the subject. The other burgess, Thomas Curteys, was elected an alderman in 1551 - a move which he resisted to the point of imprisonment and which forced him to resign his seat in parliament. In 1552 Broke was sent to lobby for further assurances from the Crown about lands recently purchased by the City.|$|R

50|$|In English and Irish law, a <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> {{grant is}} a hybrid type of land {{ownership}} typical {{in cities and}} towns. The word fee is derived from fief, meaning a feudal landholding, and a <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> grant {{is similar to a}} fee simple {{in the sense that it}} gives the grantee the right to hold a freehold estate, the only difference being the payment of an annual rent (farm being an archaic word for rent) and covenants, thus putting both parties in a landlord-tenant relationship.|$|E

25|$|Early farming {{equipment}} {{relied heavily}} on horses. Labour on the farm could not be performed by farmers alone; cultivation technologies were not sophisticated, so devices such as harrows, carriages and harvest racks were the standard. Steam-powered farming machinery {{began to appear in}} southern Saskatchewan in the 1920s, which created much public attention for farmers using the machines. Despite fascination with the new technologies, the machinery disappeared from Saskatchewan farms during the 1930s; the machines were not economically viable amid the Great Depression. This resulted in a renaissance for horses, and early farming technology returned to regular use. It wasn’t until the 1940s that farming machinery would see a resurgence amid a flourishing post-World War II economy. The average <b>fee</b> for <b>farming</b> equipment was $40,000-$50,000. Ever since that time, farm machinery has been evolving technologically and quickly climbing in price. Today, the necessary farm machines cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This high price creates great difficulty for new farmers wishing to enter the industry.|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} cause of lowing rate of irrigation use fee's collection through {{the examination of the}} farmer affordability in paying the fee. The study chooses to investigate one of the nine pilot irrigation management transfer programs in the Lao PDR.

The irrigation service fee (ISF) affordable function and 45 degree plotting diagram are used in the analysis. The findings indicate that farmers, who cultivate rice only, have the least capacity to pay the fee. However, other farmers, who cultivate rice and cash crops or only cash-crop, are able to pay the fee and 11 times higher than current ISF charged. The study also confirms that ISF paid farmers actually line closely to the total average ISF.

40|$|Sheep, {{like other}} domesticated {{ruminant}} species, {{have adapted to}} a wide range of environments from the temperate regions through to the humid tropics, including some of the world's most arid areas. Unlike the commercial production systems - both extensive and intensive - commonly found in the developed world, sheep production in the ACP countries remains largely traditional and sheep are also too often an undervalued resource. Small-scale. family based, systems are commonly found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and sub-saharan Africa, where sheep are usually kept as a component in mixed farming practices. Sheep, being prolific. provide an attractive return on investment to resource-poor farmers. Unlike cattle, initial investment is lower and lambs offer a more flexible product. It is easy to sell a lamb to cover outgoings such as school <b>fees,</b> <b>farm</b> inputs (seeds and fertilizer), or to cover social or religious commitments. Sheep sales can tide a family over the critical pre-harvest period when last season's food reserves are running out. In many communities women may also own and benefit from sheep ownership rather than just looking after them. Throughout the ACP countries there are numerous breeds of sheep many of which have not been fully documented. However all, to varying degrees, have adapted to their local environments. For example, recent results from ILCA have shown that Red Maasai sheep show genetic resistance to endoparasites in their home ranges in coastal Kenya. Some other notable breeds include the trypanotolerant West Africa Dwarf (Djallonk 9); the large, fat-tailed Sudanese Desert; the Macina wool breed from Niger; the fat-rumped Black Head Persian; and the prolific Barbados Blackbelly. now widespread throughout the Caribbean and used in crossing programmes with local breeds elsewhere. Traditional systems Apart from the presence of adapted breeds one other factor distinguishes traditional production systems, almost without exception: they operate with minimal inputs. Cash inputs are rare and labour is usually provided by the family - often the children. Feed is rarely purchased. with animals depending on common grazing, crop residues and browse. Other inputs such as mineral supplements and prophylactic treatment are rarely provided, even if they are available. Yet, even under such conditions, sheep remain productive animals, converting available feed resources into valuable products. Sheep are prolific. Although multiple births are less common than with goats, in the tropics they usually produce young three times in two years. This enables most breeds to rear around 1. 5 lambs per ewe per year. Although goats have larger litter sizes, work with dwarf sheep and goats in Nigeria has shown that sheep are more efficient meat producers. This is due to the greater survival rate and superior growth of the lambs. The main constraint to increased productivity. for both species, is the high pre-weaning mortality that often exceeds 30...|$|R
