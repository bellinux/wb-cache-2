Before 1977, in France, he was distinguished by a sound 'pointillisme': a marked harmonic sensitivity, with which he organized imaginative soundcolour combinations into 'microstructures' spread out in an imaginary sound canvas, bringing to mind the paintings of Joan Miró, who had charmed the composer at the time. (<b>Docimology,</b> one of his more beautiful and characteristic works, is from this period.) Chronologically, his musical turn Concert Music Slides, 1977 follows his coming home (1975): melody (tonal, modal, atonal), themes, elaboration as well as improvisation, 'physical' rhythms (sometimes asymmetrical and folkish), chords contradicted by unisoni, elements or inspirations from folk music (from Greece and Eastern cultures, either traditional or elaborated through 'ethnic' schools) and Byzantine music (his Love Song is performed by a cantor), and other codes or techniques of communication (e.g. jazz, rock). However, by replacing this 'hermetic' idiom with authenticated codes of communication, the music of Sfetsas expands sometimes into great lengths, and reveals a painful loneliness and a quest for the other, {{in which it is}} difficult to distinguish between the personal and the socio-environmental factors. Behind the persistence of his writing one can guess a dramatic need for communication. Despite the ruggedness of the themes and some instances of classical 'elaboration', the three parts of his gigantic (duration: 61'46"!) piano suite Cactus Light ('80-'83) often give the impression of one lonely pianist improvising. One of the most fascinating of his latest works is Moments of a Lonesome Town: within the aloneness and inhumanity of the modern world, the quest for the other continues, with a more emphatic lyricism. So, hope still persists." ...|$|E

For {{a long time}} and in various disciplines (didactic, educational sciences, psychology, <b>docimology),</b> assessment is the topic of several works and reflexions which contribute to define it and to specify the nature of the supports activities which allow to implement it. Generally, assessment regulates learning activities and check pupils competences. But assessment also takes part in the pupils' selection and in their social integration with examinations and contests. The choice of the methods, the tools and the techniques depends mainly on the objectives assigned by the teaching. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|The <b>docimology</b> {{research}} {{showed that}} the standardized testing is an efficient evaluation form of the learners ’ competencies provided to meet qualities of validity, reliability, sensitivity, diagnosticity, equity, practicability, communicability and authenticity. When standardized tests meet these qualities, they are appreciated by trainers, learners and by heads of training institutions. Currently, the construction and the quality management of standardized qualifying evaluations is a worry for the higher/university education in many European countries which have to face a still growing number of students. The training professionals and the human resources managers of companies are often constrained to evaluate staff competencies acquired outside the schools. Moreover, these concerns, regarding {{the quality of the}} tests, are also in relation with a worldwide movement of the introduction of quality management in education and training activities. Our research aims at facilitating the creation of standardized tests to make them more reliable, more efficient and quicker to set up, in order to satisfy at best the actual requirements of the education/training/human resources world. Our objective is to create an electronic platform of construction and quality control in standardized testing entitled "e-C&QCST (electronic Construction & Quality Control in Standardized Testing) build in an “Open Source " policy for a web based utilisation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFrom the {{beginning}} of the <b>docimology</b> (1922), the assessing of the learning has become increasingly important in the interpretation of study and, in general, in evaluation of the quality in education. Several measurement instruments have been offered such as: distribution pentenaria, t scores, item analysis. Recently, in the context of item response theory (IRT) it is emerging a new measurement technique based on Rasch Analysis in order to obtain an objective measure that does not dependent on either the characteristics of the measuring instrument and does not depend on the skills of individuals. Although Rasch Analysis allows of offering some interesting research, it remains open issues for the effective implementation of the instrument. The main problems are: the construction of a test and the interpretation of results. In this paper we address the second issue: the interpretation of results. At this regard it is proposed a conversion of logit scores into an evaluation scale more comprehensible and more closed to the measurements of assessing adopted by teachers typically expressed on the scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very good). In detail, after having briefly presented the technique of Rasch Analysis, it will be presented an application of the method on 34 students with the purpose to analyze the ability in learning of mathematics. A conversion of the logit output in to a new measurement scale from 0 to 10 has been proposed to make more easy the interpretation of the scor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an exploratory study, which examines the results of a flipped classroom trial conducted for 154 students. This work was carried out in a course of <b>Docimology</b> at University of Palermo for future teachers, during the first semester of the academic year 2015. In this article we present the methodology, the tools and the main results of the exploratory study. As the flip learning model based on students learning by themselves, it is especially well adapted to the university environment. Flipped learning allows for a much more interactive classroom lesson, with the teacher helping students when they are stuck as opposed to the traditional set-up of students passively listening to lectures and taking their assignments home afterwards. Teacher used the flipped classroom style for a part of the lesson and the traditional lecture-style teaching methodology for the other part. Some interviews were conducted with the students in the flipped classroom to gather information on their views of the learning environment in a flipped classroom. A comparison of the quantitative results of the grades between the different part of the lessons was used to compare the academic outcomes between the two teaching methodologies. Student views on the flipped classroom were mixed with the academic outcomes. These findings are discussed in terms of how the flipped classroom teaching methodology needs to be implemented properly and {{whether or not it is}} an effective way to engage students in the learning process. At the end of the study we can say that with the use of flip model the attendance increased significantly. The research shows that there is a broad and general agreement on the importance and relevance of adopting innovative teaching strategies with future teachers...|$|E
