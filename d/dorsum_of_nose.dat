40|$|Background: Transverse nasal groove is a {{condition}} of cosmetic concern which awaits due recognition and has been widely described as a shallow groove that extends transversely over the <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose.</b> However, we observed variations in the clinical presentations of this entity, hitherto undescribed in literature. Aims: We conducted a clinicoepidemiological study of transverse nasal lesions in patients attending our outpatient department. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study. We screened all patients attending our out-patient department for presence of transverse nasal lesions, signs of any dermatosis and associated other skin conditions. Results: One hundred patients were recruited in the study. Females (80 %) predominated over males. Most patients were of 15 - 45 years age group (70 %). Majority of the transverse nasal lesions were classical transverse nasal groove (39 %) and others included transverse nasal line (28 %), strip (28 %), ridge (4 %) and loop (1 %). Seborrhoeic diathesis {{was the most common}} condition associated with transverse nasal lesion. Conclusions: Occurrence of transverse nasal line, strip, ridge and loop, in addition to classical transverse nasal groove implies that latter is actually a subset of transverse nasal lesions. Common association of this entity with seborrheic dermatitis, seborrhea and dandruff raises a possibility of whether transverse nasal lesion is a manifestation of seborrheic diathesis...|$|E

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Facial photographs (front view and profile) of 60 patients in the pre-expansion period, immediate post-expansion period and one year following rapid maxillary expansion with a Haas appliance were evaluated on 2 occasions by 3 experienced orthodontists independently, with a 2 -week interval between evaluations. The examiners were instructed to assess nasal morphology and had no knowledge regarding the content of the study. Intraexaminer and interexaminer agreement (assessed using the Kappa statistic) was acceptable. RESULTS: From the analysis of the mode of the examiners' findings, no alterations in nasal morphology occurred regarding the following aspects: <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose,</b> alar base, nasal width of middle third and nasal base. Alterations were only detected in the nasolabial angle in 1. 64 % of the patients between the pre-expansion and immediate post-expansion photographs.

40|$|Purpose Non-melanoma skin cancers are {{the most}} {{frequent}} skin tumours; in 25. 5 % of cases, they are reported to affect the nasal area. For an excellent surgical outcome, first of all the radical excision of the lesion is important, with appropriate margins of healthy skin {{in order to avoid}} recurrences. Moreover is important to achieve a good aesthetical result, avoiding distortion of the aesthetic units and preserving their functions. Material and methods We have applied the modified crescentic flap, described by Smadja in 2007, to 24 nasal skin defects left by oncologic surgery. It consists of the crescent-shaped resection of Burow's triangle all around the alar groove that allows the advancement of the flap to the tip <b>of</b> the <b>nose,</b> hiding the scar in the alar groove.

Conclusion For skin defects localized in the midline or paramedian line <b>of</b> the <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose,</b> the crescentic flap seems to be a good solution to obtain the better aesthetic result with respect to both anatomy and function of the nasal area, sparing the patient a second intervention or an overly invasive procedure...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: We {{report a}} case of {{surgical}} correction <b>of</b> a saddle <b>nose</b> deformity, causing severe ventilation restrictions in a 42 -year-old man diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune disorder, in which antibodies to type II collagen cause an inflammatory destruction of cartilage. If septal cartilage <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> is involved, destruction leads to collapse <b>of</b> the <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose,</b> causing a saddle nose deformity. Patients suffer from a ventilation disorder of varying degree depending on the response to or onset of immunosuppressive therapy. In the described patient, {{the destruction of the}} nasal septum, in addition to unstable tracheal cartilage, caused a severe restriction in ventilation, with total collapse of the internal nasal valves during forced inspiration. To improve the function of the external airways the patient underwent surgery to reconstruct the nasal septum. Although cartilage grafts are {{the state of the art}} to reconstruct the nasal septum, we used a bone graft from the iliac crest, because the autoimmune polychondritis precludes cartilage grafting due to expected cartilage destruction. At follow up 2 years postoperatively no signs of bone resorption or deterioration of the improved airway were observed. We conclude that the use of bone grafts is a promising method to restore and improve ventilation disorders caused by a saddle nose deformity in relapsing polychondritis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{composite}} graft {{from the}} conchal cartilage is a graft {{that is often}} used, especially in surgery on the nose, due to its capacity to resolve problems of cover and tissue deficit, arising from the removal of neoplasms or {{as the result of}} trauma, burns or following over-aggressive rhinoplasty. We have started to use skin-perichondrium-cartilage graft from the ear to cover large areas <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> with very satisfying results as well as we describe in the reported clinical case. Methods The operation consisted of reconstruction of the cartilaginous nasal septum, which had previously been removed, using two vestibular labial mucosa flaps to reconstruct the mucosa, and cartilage from the ear conch for the cartilaginous septum. After this, the skin edges of the fistula were turned to recreate the inner lining <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> and form a vascular base of wide area to accept the composite graft. The case concerns a female 74 -year old patient who had undergone several oncological surgery for a relapsing basal cell carcinoma on the <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose.</b> The operation consisted of reconstruction of the cartilaginous nasal septum using two vestibular labial mucosa flaps to reconstruct the mucosa, and cartilage from the ear conch for the cartilaginous septum.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{excision}} of tumors {{from the face}} may create a defect {{that is difficult to}} restore. Skin grafts can only cover superficial defects and has a natural tendency to contract and may not take properly. Also, because of the colour mismatch, it is not cosmetically identical to the face. The use of regional flaps such as the median forehead flaps are usually bulky, can not cover a wide range of facial reconstruction and usually require the donor area to be grafted. The naso-labial flaps are very useful and versatile local flaps, with robust vascularity that can be readily elevated without a delay. The flap can be superiorly based to reconstruct defects on the cheek, side wall or the <b>dorsum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nose,</b> alae, collumula and the lower eye lid. Inferiorly based flaps can be used to reconstruct defects in the upper lip, anterior floor of the mouth and the lower lip. The flap can be turned over and used as a lining <b>of</b> the <b>nose</b> and the lip. Aim of the Study: In the current study we present our experience with utilization of the nasolabial flaps in facial reconstruction. We evaluated the indications, flap designs, technique, and complications. We will also assess the final functional and aesthetic results.
