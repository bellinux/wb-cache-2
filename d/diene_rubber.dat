Poly(1, 4 -cis-isoprene) from Hevea Brasiliensis was the <b>diene</b> <b>rubber</b> and crosslinking was performed in temperatures ranging from 151 to 180 °C, with carbon allotropes below and above their percolation threshold. Such carbon allotropes were characterized by different aspect ratio, surface area and pH. However, in the crosslinking reaction, they revealed common behaviour. In fact, the specific interfacial area could be used to correlate crosslinking parameters, such as induction time (ts 1) and activation energy (Ea) calculated by applying the autocatalytic model. Monotonous decrease of ts 1 and increase of Ea were observed, with points lying on master curves, regardless {{of the nature of the}} carbon allotropes. Remarkable differences were however observed in the structure of the crosslinking network: when the carbon allotrope was above the percolation threshold much larger crosslinking density was obtained in the presence of CNT whereas composites based on HSAG became soluble in hydrocarbon solvent, after the reaction with a thiol.

From the hystersis experiments it was found that PP/EOC blends also perform better fatigue properties over PP/EPDM based blends.

The main focus of the research is devoted on deformation (elastic and viscoelastic) properties of polymer materials.

Two EPDM rubbers selected {{for this study were}} comparable in co-monomer compositions but significantly different with respect to molar mass and the presence of long chain branching. Both rubbers contained 5 -ethylidene- 2 -norbornene (ENB) as diene. Solution cast films of pure EPDM samples were exposed in two different acidic solutions, viz. chromosulphuric (Cr (VI) /H 2 SO 4) and sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) (20 %, v/v) at ambient temperature from 1 to 12 weeks. XPS analysis indicated that several oxygenated species were formed on the surface of both rubbers after exposure. It was postulated from the XPS analyses that both aqueous acidic solutions attacked the olefinic double bonds (C{double bond, long}C) of ENB. Furthermore, 20 % Cr (VI) /H 2 SO 4 also attacked the allylic carbon-hydrogen (C{single bond}H) bonds of ENB resulting in more oxygenated species on the surface compared to 20 % H 2 SO 4 under identical conditions.

40|$|Blending of {{saturated}} ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) with highly unsaturated rubbers, such as natural rubber (NR) and (butadiene rubber) BR, is a rapidly developing area especially for tyre sidewall applications, where the saturated elastomer {{can be considered}} as a polymeric antioxidant for the <b>diene</b> <b>rubbers.</b> However, vulcanisates of such elastomer blends are generally poor in mechanical properties. These undesirable phenomena are generally the result of the thermodynamic incompatibility of these two types of rubber, cure incompatibility and heterogeneous filler distribution in each of the rubber phases. The objective of the project covered in this thesis is to overcome these incompatibility and reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends by various approaches and therefore improve the final mechanical properties of such blends. Besides the mechanical properties, the mechanisms involved are studied in the present work as well. In this research generally two approaches have been explored to solve the incompatibility and uneven-reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends and to improve the mechanical properties: adding a compatibilising agent and modification of the EPDM. Applying MAH-EPM as compatibilising agent leads to some improvements of the mechanical properties. However, ionic crosslinking resulting from MAH-EPM with ZnO, is not thermally stable, which limits the application at high temperatures. Different modification agents have been tried and it was found that APPS works by far most effectively. Significant improvements have been obtained with APPS-modified EPDM in blends with NR/BR. There is still some room for improvement, especially for the visco-elastic properties. But due to the excellent tensile, tear and fatigue properties, it can be a serious candidate for tyre sidewall applications. Considering the modification reaction of EPDM with APPS, the reaction mechanism is not clear yet and is worth to be further explored...|$|R
