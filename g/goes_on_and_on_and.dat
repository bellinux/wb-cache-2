In an interview with Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine in September 2008, Bear said that what inspired him to write City at the End of Time was the question, [...] "What if we're still primitive in our thinking ?", and this led to the idea for a story of [...] "a Universe that <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on, and how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s the {{presence}} of women in rock, and in particular in heavy metal bands, was usually considered by press and fans more for glamour and sexual exploitation than for the musicianship showed. Doro Pesch {{was one of the}} few exceptions; her qualities as vocalist and songwriter in Warlock, her commitment in promoting their music and her avoidance of posturing as a sex symbol won the respect of a solid fan base in the expanding European metal scene of that period, ensuring a long string of favorable articles and covers on the principal European metal magazines. In an interview in 2006 Doro remembered how [...] "we lived in paradise and had not noticed it, (...) we thought at the time, that now it <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> the success would continue automatically, (...) then came the great awakening".|$|E

6000|$|Observe, {{there is}} not a single false, or even overcharged, expression. [...] "Mound" [...] of the sea wave is {{perfectly}} simple and true; [...] "changing" [...] is as familiar as may be; [...] "foam that passed away," [...] strictly literal; and the whole line descriptive of the reality with a degree of accuracy which I know not any other verse, in the range of poetry, that altogether equals. For most people have not a distinct idea of the clumsiness and massiveness of a large wave. The word [...] "wave" [...] is used too generally of ripples and breakers, and bendings in light drapery or grass: it does not by itself convey a perfect image. But the word [...] "mound" [...] is heavy, large, dark, definite; there is no mistaking the kind of wave meant, nor missing the sight of it. Then the term [...] "changing" [...] has a peculiar force also. Most people think of waves as rising and falling. But if they look at the sea carefully, they will perceive that the waves do not rise and fall. They change. Change both place and form, but they do not fall; one wave <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> still on; now lower, now higher, now tossing its mane like a horse, now building itself together like a wall, now shaking, now steady, but still the same wave, till at last it seems struck by something, and changes, one knows not how,--becomes another wave.|$|E

[...] "Who's there?" [...] "Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself." [...] (Mrs. Finch unfolds herself--she suckles the baby, {{and tries to}} look as if she was having an {{intellectual}} treat.) [...] "Francisco and Bernardo converse in bass--Boom-boom-boom. Enter Horatio and Marcellus" [...] (Mr. Finch and Mr. Finch.) [...] "Stand! Who's there?" [...] "Friends to this ground." [...] "And liegemen to the Dane." [...] (Madame Pratolungo begins to feel the elocutionary exposition of Shakespeare, where she always feels it, in her legs. She tries to sit still on her chair. Useless! She is suffering under the malady known to her by bitter experience of Mr. Finch, as the Hamlet-Fidgets.) Bernardo and Franciso, Horatio and Marcellus, converse--Boom-boom-boom. [...] "Enter Ghost of Hamlet's Father." [...] Mr. Finch makes an awful pause. In the supernatural silence, we can hear the baby sucking. Mrs. Finch enjoys her intellectual treat. Madame Pratolungo fidgets. Lucilla catches the infection, and fidgets too. Marcellus-Finch goes on. [...] "Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio." [...] Bernardo-Finch backs him: [...] "Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio." [...] Lucilla-Finch inserts herself in the dialogue: [...] "Papa, I am very sorry; I have had a nervous headache all day; please excuse me if I take a turn in the garden." [...] The rector makes another awful pause, and glares at his daughter. (Exit Lucilla.) Horatio looks at the Ghost, and takes up the dialogue: [...] "Most like; it harrows me [...] "--Boom-boom-boom. The baby is satiated. Mrs. Finch wants her handkerchief. Madame Pratolungo seizes the opportunity of moving her distracted legs, and finds the handkerchief. Mr. Finch pauses--glares---goes on again--reaches the second scene. [...] "Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, and Lords Attendant." [...] All Mr. Finch! oh, my legs! my legs! all Mr. Finch, and Boom-boom-boom. Third scene. [...] "Enter Laertes and Ophelia." [...] (Both Rectors of Dimchurch; both with deep bass voices; both about five feet high, pitted with the small-pox, and adorned round the neck with dingy white cravats.) Mr. Finch <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on. Mrs. Finch and the baby simultaneously close their eyes in slumber. Madame Pratolungo suffers such tortures of restlessness in her lower limbs, that she longs for a skilled surgeon to take out his knife and deliver her from her own legs. Mr. Finch advances in deeper and deeper bass, in keener and keener enjoyment, to the Fourth Scene. ("Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.") Mercy! what do I hear? Is relief approaching to us from the world outside? Are there footsteps in the hall? Yes! Mrs. Finch opens her eyes; Mrs. Finch hears the footsteps, and rejoices in them as I do. Reverend Hamlet hears nothing but his own voice. He begins the scene: [...] "The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold." [...] The door opens. The rector feels a gust of air, dramatically appropriate, just at the right moment. He looks round. If it is a servant, let that domestic person tremble! No--not a servant. Guests--heavens be praised, guests. Welcome, gentlemen--welcome! No more Hamlet, tonight, thanks to You. Enter two Characters who must be instantly attended to:--Mr. Oscar Dubourg; introducing his twin-brother from America, Mr. Nugent Dubourg.|$|E
