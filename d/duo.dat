40|$|The {{orientation}} of closely linked genes in mammalian genomes is not random: {{there are more}} head-to-head (h 2 h) gene pairs than expected. To understand {{the origin of this}} enrichment in h 2 h gene pairs, we have analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of gene pairs separated by less than 600 bp of intergenic DNA (gene <b>duos).</b> We show here that a lack of head-to-tail (h 2 t) gene <b>duos</b> is an even more distinctive characteristic of mammalian genomes, with the platypus genome as the only exception. In nonmammalian vertebrate and in nonvertebrate genomes, the frequency of h 2 h, h 2 t, and tail-to-tail (t 2 t) gene <b>duos</b> is close to random. In tetrapod genomes, the h 2 t and t 2 t gene <b>duos</b> {{are more likely to be}} part of a larger gene cluster of closely spaced genes than h 2 h gene duos; in fish and urochordate genomes, the reverse is seen. In human and mouse tissues, the expression profiles of gene <b>duos</b> were skewed toward positive coexpression, irrespective of orientation. The organization of orthologs of both members of about 40 % of the human gene <b>duos</b> could be traced in other species, enabling a prediction of the organization at the branch points of gnathostomes, tetrapods, amniotes, and euarchontoglires. The accumulation of h 2 h gene <b>duos</b> started in tetrapods, whereas that of h 2 t and t 2 t gene <b>duos</b> only started in amniotes. The apparent lack of evolutionary conservation of h 2 t and t 2 t gene <b>duos</b> relative to that of h 2 h gene <b>duos</b> is thus a result of their relatively late origin in the lineage leading to mammals; we show that once they are formed h 2 t and t 2 t gene <b>duos</b> are as stable as h 2 h gene <b>duos...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although the <b>duo</b> {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the <b>duo</b> with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E
