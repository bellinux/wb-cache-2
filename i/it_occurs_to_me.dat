6000|$|... "You {{look like}} it." [...] Gordon smiled. [...] "As it happened, I saw Miss Waynefleet {{crossing}} the clearing. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that she may}} have said something that set you thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More am I," [...] he said, [...] "but I find I am dining {{with the}} Prime Minister at nine o'clock. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that you may}} have some {{influence}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{notice that}} Duson {{was found in}} your sitting-room. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a {{possibility}} {{that he may have}} met with a fate intended for some one else--for yourself, for instance, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{was in the}} {{presence}} of the aristocratic theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated intentions.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{he could}} change. I felt so secure in his love. <b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that anyone could take him from me.|$|R

6000|$|... "Agreed," [...] said Paul; [...] "but now <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that our}} pork may be raw, {{and that we}} shall want fire to cook it. Have you got flint and steel in your pocket, Master Trench?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes me}} a long time to figure a thing out," [...] he said; [...] "and when I've a problem to solve a bit of a snooze helps wonderfully. Patsy, dear, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> we're lonely." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{was making}} these expressionist paintings, but <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I was more {{interested}} in jumping around the canvas than what was on the canvas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's less credible," [...] I said. And <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} grey stretch of downland beyond {{must be the}} ridge {{to the west of}} Ridinghanger.|$|R
6000|$|... and, sir, {{now that}} <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> your talk, {{the whole of}} it, is but a wet sheet and a flowing sea, and an idle wind that follows fast, {{offering}} a striking contrast to my own discourse." ...|$|E
