25|$|Speculating on why Weir did {{not receive}} a medal during the Olympics {{even though he had}} good {{technical}} scores, Claude Mailhot of RDS network said, “This may not be politically correct, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> lost points due to his costume and his body language?” Alain Goldberg replied ”They’ll think all the boys who skate will end up like him. It sets a bad example.” Goldberg and Mailhot then made bigoted jokes about how Weir should 'compete in the women’s division'.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Now, uncle,’ said Mr. Kitterbell, {{lifting up}} {{that part of}} the mantle which covered the infant’s face, with an air of great triumph, ‘Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> like?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't for {{a moment}} think, dearest, that what he said, made me uneasy as {{regarded}} you: but whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> selected for you--of whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is jealous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is hopeful? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'How {{precious}} dull you are, Tommy!' {{said the}} Dodger, stopping short when {{there had been}} a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> thinking of, Fagin?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's--something I don't {{want you}} to let Lottie know I've got. She tells that Mr. Trannel everything, and then {{he wants to make}} fun. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> so very witty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't tell me," [...] was the reply. [...] "But it's {{good enough}} for him. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> after? Her? And mind, don't let on to a soul that I told you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{suspects}} me?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with anxiety, after pausing {{to listen to}} Caesar's opinion of the Skinners.|$|E

6000|$|The next morning, {{when the}} King awoke, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw? The wall stood there before his eyes, {{exactly as he}} had bespoken it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> did?" [...] {{returned}} Louise, resentfully; {{she did not}} in {{the least}} know what her friend's husband did, and he was no more there to speak for himself than her own.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{sorry we}} can't agree; but as regards Crestwick {{you can only}} head me off by forcing Gladwyne to interfere. Between ourselves, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a man who's likely to take a bold course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's his half-holiday," [...] Ellen replied, {{in a tone}} of disgust, [...] "and where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> gone? Gone to {{a museum}} to look at some statues! The {{schoolmaster}} called for him. They've gone off together. All I can say is that if he don't turn natural again before long, you can have him. He don't belong to me no longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mrs. King; I will {{certainly}} try {{to speak to}} him. You said nothing of Alfred; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will not be well enough?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am bothered about Engleton," [...] Forrest said. [...] "I didn't {{like his}} insisting upon cutting last night. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant by it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{concerns}} a lady, sir--no, not a lady--a young man, I ought to say, in whom {{you used to}} feel some interest. Oh, Mr. Pedgift, sir, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> Mr. Armadale and Miss Gwilt have gone up to London together to-day--alone, sir--alone in a carriage reserved for their two selves. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> going to marry her? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think,</b> {{like the rest of}} them, he's going to marry her?" ...|$|R
