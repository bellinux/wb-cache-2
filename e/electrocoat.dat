In the late 1960s, and the early 1970s, the R&D function pioneered the use of Finite Element Analysis for the body structure, and developed computerised crash simulation techniques for the complete vehicle, the occupants and the pedestrian. Between 1973 & 1980 the R & D function also developed plastic fuel tanks that proved superior to the only other current ones of the time produced by Volkswagen.|$|E
50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (<b>Electrocoat</b> Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|E

50|$|The {{aromatic}} polyurethane and urea type crosslinker {{is one of}} {{the significant}} reasons why many cathodic <b>electrocoats</b> show high levels of protection against corrosion. Of course {{it is not the only}} reason, but if one compares <b>electrocoating</b> compositions with aromatic urethane crosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better. However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance. If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur. A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers. A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines. Urethane crosslinkers based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) can be expected to produce toluene diamine as a side reaction, whereas those based on Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate produce diaminodiphenylmethane and higher order aromatic polyamines. The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight. Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.|$|R

40|$|Tin <b>electrocoated</b> steel strip, also {{referred}} to as Flandres foil, is largely used for manufacturing food containers. Tinplates must have good corrosion resistance, workability, weldability, as well as a bright appearance. The woodgrain defect, a not yet fully understood defect that occurs on tinplates and accounts for their high scrap rate, consists of alternate bands of bright/dull reflectivity and resembles longitudinally cut wood. Observations of the woodgrain defect by scanning electron microscopy showed that the molten tin spreads irregularly during both the melting and solidification stages. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the metallic tin tended to crystallize in the (200) direction for coupons with and without the woodgrain defect. Nevertheless, the preferential orientation degree decreased for coupons with the woodgrain defect. The rocking curves, also known as omega-scan, showed that the tin grains were uniformly aligned parallel to the strip surface for coupons with no defects, whereas for tinplates with woodgrain, the tin grains were not uniformly oriented, probably due to the misalignment of the grains in relation to the surface.

A detailed study of the aluminum reduction mechanism was carried out using the electrochemical methods of linear sweep voltammetry, cathodic chronopotentiometry and cathodic chronoamperometry. The solid state diffusion coefficient of the aluminum into the steel substrate was evaluated using cathodic chronoamperometry and was found to be D(Al) = 1. 8 x 10 (- 11) cm 2 /sec. From the mechanism found by the electrochemical reaction study, the experimental parameters could be adjusted in order to obtain in a reproducible way a homogeneous, aluminum-rich surface layer of regular thickness on steel electrodes.

The numerical simulations were performed by software THESEUS-FE E-Coating Module, which is based on the finite element method. Firstly, a detailed coating thickness measurement was performed to determine the coating distribution on a car body. Thereafter, {{on the basis of the}} car body CAD data and e-coating bath measurements, a finite element model (FE-model) of the car body in the bath was built. In order to reconstruct the measured coating thicknesses as good as possible, different simulation models and methods were investigated. The influences of holes and positioning of hood and doors on the process were also investigated. Furthermore, different voltage programs were considered in order to classify the influence of the voltage program and anodes positioning on the process in general. Also, the areas in the car body cavities without full paint coverage, which are of special interest for planning process, were identified. In order to avoid this, some additional holes on the car body were inserted, and thereafter the comparison of the simulation results and a real experiment should be performed. Moreover, in order to calibrate the lacquer parameters, experiments with a test-box, which is suitable for the throwing power measurement, were performed and thereafter simulated. Unfortunately, the calibration through the text-box was not very useful due to different process conditions between the test-box experiments and the e-coating process performed in a real paint shop.
