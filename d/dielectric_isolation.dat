In this work, new segmented four-quadrant diodes for beam alignment purposes are fabricated on both ultrathin (10 μ m-thick) and bulk silicon substrates. Four-quadrant diodes implementing different design parameters as well as auxiliary test structures (single diodes and MOS capacitors) are studied.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{challenge in}} biomedical sciences is {{to devise a}} palette of molecular probes that can enable simultaneous and quantitative imaging of tens to hundreds of species down to ultralow concentrations. Addressing this need using surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based probes is potentially possible. Here, we theorize a rational design and optimization strategy to obtain reproducible probes using nanospheres with alternating metal and reporter-filled <b>dielectric</b> layers. The <b>isolation</b> of reporter molecules from metal surfaces suppresses chemical enhancement, and consequently signal enhancements are determined by electromagnetic effects alone. This strategy synergistically couples interstitial surface plasmons and permits the use of almost any molecule as a reporter by {{eliminating the need for}} surface attachment. Genetic algorithms are employed to optimize the layer dimensions to provide controllable enhancements exceeding 11 orders of magnitude and of single molecule sensitivity for nonresonant and resonant reporters, respectively. The strategy also provides several other opportunities, including a facile route to tuning the response of these structures to be spectrally flat and localization of the enhancement within a specific volume inside or outside the probe. The spectrally uniform enhancement for multiple excitation wavelengths and for different shifts enables generalized probes, wheras enhancement tuning permits a large dynamic range by suppression of enhancements from outside the probe. Combined, these theoretical calculations open the door for a set of reproducible and robust probes with controlled sensitivity for molecular sensing over a concentration range of over 20 orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Current leakage on a planar {{field effect}} {{transistor}} (FET) channel’s side surfaces is more significant as the channel width decreases. Traps and positive fixed charges at the interface of Silicon and the <b>isolation</b> <b>dielectric</b> (STI) are mainly responsible for this. An accumulated body approach introduces a side-gate structure surrounding {{the body of the}} transistor, which can be used to accumulate the body in narrow structures to suppress the leakage. A separately controlled top gate is used for transistor action. In this work, the fabrication process and electrical behavior of short and narrow-channel (10 nm scale) bulk Si accumulated body MOSFETs are analyzed through three-dimensional numerical studies. Results are verified experimentally with devices fabricated at IBM Watson Research Labs using conventional CMOS processes. Simulation results show suppression of leakage currents by 106 times for no side-interface charges and by 1010 times for an interface positive fixed charge density of 1012 cm- 2. The threshold voltage (VT) can be dynamically controlled by the side-gate through accumulation of the body. For simulated structures of W x L = 10 nm x 15 nm, VT shift per a negative volt of side-gate bias (ΔVT/ΔVside) is more than 0. 3 V/V. For experimental devices of effective W x L = 15 x 27 nm, ΔVT/ΔVside ratio is more than 1 V/V. Reliable high temperature (3 ̆e 600 K) operation and improvement in subthreshold slope and drain induced barrier lowering is also shown in simulations and in experimental structures. Various steady-state and AC analyses are also conducted to characterize the effect of the side-gate and its relation to other terminals. One such relationship exists between the side-gate and the substrate, where the capacitive coupling of the side-gate enhances the depletion effect of substrate biasing. It is shown through simulations, and verified through experiments, that although the mechanisms of VT control by the side-gate and substrate biasing are different, they enhance the effect of each other. Furthermore, the effect of line edge roughness on active area of the MOSFET is analyzed through numerical analysis and it is shown that the side-gate of an accumulated body MOSFET helps direct the current towards the center of the channel...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{demonstrated}} that divinyltetramethyldisiloxane-benzocyclobutene (BCB), which {{has previously been}} used as an <b>isolation</b> <b>dielectric</b> in III-IV semiconductor devices, in fact makes an excellent gate dielectric material in OFETs after suitable purification. Robust ultra-thin films with high glass transition temperature and high dielectric breakdown strength {{can be obtained by}} simple spin-coating followed by rapid-thermal-anneal to above 250 °C. With this material, we were able to demonstrate remarkable performance in polymer OFETs and explore several aspects of their physics. In Chapter 2, we introduce the use of BCB as a good candidate for solution-processable organic gate dielectric. Pinhole-free ultra-thin gate dielectric film as thin as 50 nm can be made from this material. With this gate dielectric, robust continual cyclic operation of poly[(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene- 2, 7 -diyl) - alt- (phenylene-(N-(p - 2 -butylphenyl-imino-phenylene)) (TFB) FETs at 120 °C was achieved. Previously, the thinnest practical solution-processable gate dielectric thickness was > 300 nm-thick. In Chapter 3, we demonstrated self-organised polymer semiconductor/dielectric FETs fabricated using a spontaneous and an unusual vertical phase separation of the TFB polymer semiconductor and the BCB dielectric materials during film spinning. This method enables the formation of semiconductor and dielectric layers at the same time without exposing their interface to air. Using these devices, we established that a critical root-mean-square interface roughness of 0. 7 nm (measured on the 100 nm length scale) could be tolerated without loss of mobility of the devices, probably related to the hopping of the carries at the interface. In Chapter 4, we demonstrated using this non-trapping BCB dielectric the generality of n-type field-effect conduction across a wide range of polymer organic semiconductors. We showed that this was previously suppressed by interface trapping of the accumulated electrons by the –OH group in the gate dielectrics that have often been used. We found electron mobilities very similar to, if not larger than, hole mobilities across a range of organic semiconductors. Therefore, many (though not all) π -conjugated materials are by their nature ambipolar and can support both electron and hole conduction nearly equally well. Their previous classification into “n-type” and “p-type” materials is thus somewhat arbitrary. Finally, in Chapter 5, we used BCB as the top gate dielectric and fabricated fully functional double-gate OFETs over a bottom gate dielectric. We showed that such devices exhibit electrostatic coupling of the two gates occurs to produce an “ AND” logic gate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The work {{reported}} In {{this thesis}} {{is concerned with}} the fabrication and characterisation of microwave lumped element overlay capacitors for used at 10 GHz. The research has included the investigation and selection of suitable materials for use in the component manufacture, and,the development and optimisation of the necessary fabrication processes, which at the outset of' the project, were not available to the author. For this reason, and for the benefit of other research workers involved in the construction of microwave thin film components, the presentation of the processing data in this thesis is biased towards step-by-step accounts of' each of the major processes. The processing data is then readily available in a practical, and useful, form. Of' particular interest in the processing field, is the novel technique developed for the deposition of' the capacitor dielectric material without etching. This work was carried out in collaboration with a fellow research student, and is covered by a U. K. Patent. The microwave measurement of the capacitor properties have been performed using microstrip resonators. To enable these measurementsresonators to be accurately designed, measurements have been performed on, and results documented for, the transmission characteristics of microstrip lines on quartz substrates, and for the properties of micros trip gap discontinuities, and microstrip gap-and-step discontinuities, at X band. The technique for the measurement of the overlay capacitor properties is novel in that the capacitor is measured "in situ", and bond wires, which are a characteristic of' other measurement techniques, are not required. This permits a higher measurement accuracy, due to the reduction in connector parasitics. In addition, the equivalent circuit approach to the calculation of the capacitor properties is used, and not the perturbation approach, which permits large changes in frequency and Q factor {{during the course of the}} measurements, and this allows very measurements to be obtained. Results are presented for measurements performed on overlay capacitors, using silicon dioxide and alumina dielectric materials, and these indicate that capacitors with useful values of capacitance and Q factor can be produced at X band. Theories are presented for the capacitor electrode inductance and resistance, and these enable the dielectric constant and Q :factor of the capacitor dielectric materials, to be evaluated from the measured ccapacitor properties.
