These forays will place unprecedented demands on launch systems. They must not only blast out of <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> well as during the Apollo moon missions, but also launch the supplies needed to sustain a larger crew over much longer periods. Thus all spacecraft systems, including those for the separation of metabolic carbon dioxide and water from a crewed vehicle, must be minimized with respect to mass, power, and volume. Emphasis is also placed on system robustness both to minimize replacement parts and ensure crew safety when a quick return to earth is not possible. This paper describes efforts to improve on typical packed beds of sorbent pellets by making use of structured sorbents and alternate bed configurations to improve system efficiency and reliability. The development efforts described offer a complimentary approach combining testing of subscale systems and multiphysics computer simulations to characterize the regenerative heating substrates and evaluation of engineered structured sorbent geometries.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study of the correlation between the performances of wheels for lunar vehicles predicted using the Nepean wheeled vehicle performance model (NWVPM), developed under the auspices of Vehicle Systems Development Corporation, Ottawa, Canada, and the corresponding test data presented in Performance evaluation of wheels for lunar vehicles, Technical Report M- 70 - 2, prepared for George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA, by the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The NWVPM was originally developed for design and performance evaluation of terrestrial off-road wheeled vehicles. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the potential of the NWVPM for evaluating wheel candidates for the new generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles. Two versions of a wire-mesh wheel and a hoop-spring wheel, which were considered as candidates for lunar roving vehicles for the NASA Apollo program in the late 1960 s, together with a pneumatic wheel were examined in this study. The tractive performances of these wheels and of a 464 test vehicle with the pneumatic wheels on air-dry sand were predicted using the NWVPM and compared with the corresponding test data obtained under <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> and previously documented in the above-named report. While test data on wheel or vehicle performances obtained under <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> may not necessarily be representative of those on extra-terrestrial bodies, because of the differences in gravity and in environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, it is still a valid approach to use test data obtained under <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> to evaluate the predictive capability of the NWVPM and its potential applications to predicting wheel or wheeled rover performances on extra-terrestrial bodies. Results of this study show that, using the ratio (P 20 /W) of the drawbar pull to normal load at 20 per cent slip as a performance indicator, there is a reasonable correlation between the predictions and experimental data. This indicates that the NWVPM has the potential as an engineering tool for evaluating wheel candidates for a future generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles, provided that appropriate input data are available...|$|E

40|$|Satellite laser-ranging (SLR) {{has been}} observing the tiny {{variations}} in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> global <b>gravity</b> for over 2 decades. The oblateness of the Earth's gravity field, J 2, {{has been observed}} to undergo a secular decrease of J 2 due mainly to the post-glacial rebound of the mantle. Sometime around 1998 this trend reversed quite suddenly. This reversal persisted until 2001, {{at which point the}} atmosphere-corrected time series appears to have reversed yet again towards normal. This anomaly signifies a large interannual change in global mass distribution. A number of possible causes have been considered, with oceanic mass redistribution as the leading candidate although other effects, such as glacial melting and core effects may be contributing. In fact, a strong correlation has been found between the J 2 variability and the Pacific decadal oscillation. It is relatively more difficult to solve for corresponding signals in the shorter wavelength harmonics from the existing SLR-derived time variable gravity results, although it appears that geophysical fluid mass transport is being observed. For example, the recovered J 3 time series shows remarkable agreement with NCEP-derived estimates of atmospheric gravity variations. Likewise, some of the non-zonal harmonic components have significant interannual signal that appears to be related to mass transport related to climatic effects such as El Nino Southern Oscillation. We will present recent updates on the J 2 evolution, as well as a monthly time sequence of low-degree component map of the time-variable gravity complete through degree 4, and examine possible geophysical/climatic causes...|$|R

Among several groups now examining the mass redistribution in the global geophysical fluids in search of the cause(s), we report here a temporally coinciding anomalies found in the extratropic north + south Pacific basins. Clearly seen in the leading EOFPC mode for extratropic Pacific, these anomalies occurred in sea-surface height, sea-surface temperature, and temperature- and salinity-depth profiles. We based our analysis on two different data sources: TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry, and the ECCO ocean general circulation model output assimilating T/P data. The magnitude of these changes, when converted to equivalent J 2 change, appears to be a few times too small to explain the observed J 2 directly. These findings, {{and the fact that the}} anomalies occurred following the strong 1997 - 98 El Nino, suggest strong geophysical connection of the interannual-to-decadal variation of 52 with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the ultimate global-change processes that cause PDO. More work is underway, and additional independent data sources are examined, paying close attention to the fact that the J 2 anomaly has been reversing back to normal since 2001. These include: (1) cryospheric contributions (melting of glaciers and ice sheets); (2) land hydrological contributions; (3) polar sea influences (e g, via deep flow); (4) fluid flow in Earth's core; (5) time-variable gravity signals from SLR in higher harmonic degree/order, including J 3,J 4, (2, 1), and (2, 2) coefficients, considering their lower signal-to-noise ratios; (6) Earth rotation data in terms of length-of-day and polar motion...|$|R

However {{during most of}} their missions on board the Space Shuttle or International Space Station, astronauts wear ordinary clothing, such as cotton shirts and pants. As the behaviour of flames is considerably different in microgravity than under <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity,</b> fabrics are expected to burn in a different fashion in microgravity than when tested on earth.

However, rather than using a laboratory burner, the apparatus uses a hot wire system to ignite 200 mm high by 80 mm wide fabric specimens. Fabric temperatures are measured using thermocouples and/or an infrared imaging system, while flame spread rates are measured using real time observations or video.

In this paper a special version of the space-wise method based on the second method of Neumann for fast determination of the harmonic coefficients Cnm, Snm of the Earth’s gravitational potential is given based on the radial gravity gradients of the EGG_TRF_ 2 product, except of two polar gaps filled by radial gradients from the EGM 2008 gravity model. In the pre-processing stage GOCE-based second degree radial derivatives were averaged to the regular grid through Kalman static filter with additional Gaussean smoothing of residual radial derivatives. All computations are made by iterations. As the first step the determination of the preliminary NULP- 01 S model up to degree/order 220 derived from the Gaussean grid of the GOCE radial derivatives with respect to the WGS- 84 reference field was developed based only one of the radial gradients EGG_TRF_ 2 in the EFRF-frame.

40|$|Astronauts {{experience}} {{disturbances in}} sensorimotor function following {{their return to}} Earth due to adaptive responses that occur during exposure to the microgravity conditions of space flight. As part of the Crew Exploration Vehicle design requirements, the crewmember adapted to the microgravity state may need to egress the vehicle {{within a few minutes}} for safety and operational reasons in various sea state conditions following a water landing. The act of emergency egress includes and is not limited to rapid motor control tasks (including both fine motor such as object manipulation and gross motor such as opening a hatch) and visual acuity tasks while maintaining spatial orientation and postural stability in time to escape safely. Exposure to even low frequency motions (0. 2 - 2. 0 Hz) induced by sea conditions surrounding a vessel can cause significant fine and gross motor control problems affecting critical functions. These motion frequencies coupled with the varying sea state conditions (frequencies ranging from 0. 125 - 0. 5 Hz) cause performance deficits by affecting the efficacy of motor and visual acuity dependent skills in tasks critical to emergency egress activities such as visual monitoring of displays, actuating discrete controls, operating auxiliary equipment and communicating with Mission Control and recovery teams. Thus, during exploration class missions the sensorimotor disturbances due to the crewmember's adaptation to microgravity may lead to disruption in the ability to maintain postural stability and perform functional egress tasks during the initial introduction to the Earth's gravitational environment. At present, the functional implication of the interactions between a debilitated crewmember during readaptation to <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> and the environmental constraints imposed by a water landing scenario is not defined and no operational countermeasure has been implemented to mitigate this risk. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a mechanism whereby noise can assist and hence enhance the response of neural systems to relevant, subthreshold sensory signals. Application of subthreshold stochastic resonance noise coupled to sensory input either through the proprioceptive, visual or vestibular sensory systems, has been shown to improve motor function. Crew members who have adapted to microgravity have acquired new sensorimotor strategies that take time to discard. We hypothesize that detection of time-critical subthreshold sensory signals will {{play a crucial role in}} improving strategic responses and thus the rate of skill re-acquisition will be faster, leading to faster recovery of function during their re-adaptation to Earth G. Therefore, we expect the use of stochastic resonance mechanisms will enhance the acquisition of new strategic abilities. This process should ensure rapid restoration of functional egress capabilities during the initial return to Earth G after prolonged space flight. Therefore, the overall goals of this project are to investigate performance of motor and visual tasks during varying sea state conditions and develop a countermeasure based on stochastic resonance that could be implemented to enhance sensorimotor capabilities with the aim of facilitating rapid adaptation to <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity,</b> allowing rapid CEV egress on water in varying sea states following long-duration space flight...|$|E

This study represents the first comprehensive examination of unilateral otolith function following space flight. Ten astronauts participated in unilateral otolith function tests three times pre-flight and up to four times after Shuttle flights from landing day through the subsequent 10 days. During unilateral centrifugation (UC, +/- 3. 5 cm at 400 deg/s), utricular function was examined by the perceptual changes reflected by the subjective visual vertical (SVV) and by video-oculographic measurement of the otolith-mediated ocular counter-roll (OOR). Unilateral saccular reflexes were recorded by measurement of collic Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (cVEMP). Although data from a few subjects were not obtained early post-flight, a general increase in asymmetry of otolith responses was observed on landing day relative to pre-flight baseline, with a subsequent reversal in asymmetry within 2 - 3 days. Recovery to baseline levels was achieved within 10 days. This fluctuation in the asymmetry measures appeared strongest for SVV, in a consistent direction for OOR, and in an opposite direction for cVEMP.

This test was performed 20 minutes, 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the final training session. Stride frequency and auditory reaction time were collected as measures of postural stability and cognitive effort, respectively. Subjects who received training showed less alteration in stride frequency and auditory reaction time compared to controls. Trained subjects maintained their level of performance over 6 months.

By looking at the radio waves from GPS satellites, a technology developed at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) not only precisely calculates its position, but can also use a technique known as radio occultation to help scientists study the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere and <b>gravity</b> field to improve weather forecasts, monitor climate change, and enhance space weather research. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit group of universities in Boulder, Colorado, compares radio occultation to the appearance of a pencil when viewed though a glass of water. The water molecules change the path of visible light waves so that the pencil appears bent, just like molecules in the air bend GPS radio signals as they pass through (or are occulted by) the atmosphere. Through measurements of the amount of bending in the signals, scientists can construct detailed images of the ionosphere (the energetic upper part of the atmosphere) and also gather information about atmospheric density, pressure, temperature, and moisture. Once collected, this data can be input into weather forecasting and climate models for weather prediction and climate studies. Traditionally, such information is obtained through the use of weather balloons. In 1998, JPL started developing a new class of GPS space science receivers, called Black Jack, that could take precise measurements of how GPS signals are distorted or delayed along their way to the receiver.

Moreover, there is enough carbon in chondritic material to stabilize carbonates into the mantles of Mars or Venus {{as well as in}} the Earth. However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles. [1] and [2] show evidences of the stability of clinopyroxene Ca(Mg,Fe) Si 2 O 6 + magnesite (Mg,Fe) CO 3 in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle around 6 GPa (about 180 km). The stability of oxidized forms of carbon (like magnesite) depends on the oxygen fugacity of the system. In the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle, the maximum carbon content is 10000 ppm [3]. The fO 2 parameter varies vertically as a function of pressure, but also laterally because of geodynamic processes like subduction. Thus, carbonates, graphite, diamond, C-rich gases and melts are all stable forms of carbon in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle. [4] show that the fO 2 variations observed in SNC meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. [5] inferred from thermodynamic calculations that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond). After [6], a metasomatizing agent like a CO 2 -rich melt may infiltrate the mantle source of nakhlites. However, according to [7] and [8], the FeO wt% value in the Martian bulk mantle is more than twice that of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle (KLB- 1 composition by [9]). As iron and carbon are two elements with various oxidation states, Fe/C interaction mechanisms must be considered...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to the {{microgravity}} {{conditions of}} space flight induces adaptive modification in sensorimotor function allowing astronauts {{to operate in}} this unique environment. This adaptive state, however, is inappropriate for a 1 -g environment. Consequently astronauts must spend time readapting to <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> following their return to Earth. During this readaptation period, alterations in sensorimotor function cause various disturbances in astronaut gait during postflight walking. They often rely more on vision for postural and gait stability and many report the need for greater cognitive supervision of motor actions that previous to space flight were fully automated. Over {{the last several years}} our laboratory has investigated postflight astronaut locomotion with the aim of better understanding how adaptive changes in underlying sensorimotor mechanisms contribute to postflight gait dysfunction. Exposure to the microgravity conditions of space flight induces adaptive modification in the control of vestibularly-mediated reflexive head movement during locomotion after space flight. Furthermore, during motor learning, adaptive transitions are composed of two main mechanisms: strategic and plastic. Strategic mechanisms represent immediate and transitory modifications in control to deal with changes in the prevailing environment that, if prolonged, induce plastic mechanisms designed to automate new behavioral responses. The goal {{of the present study was}} to examine the contributions of sensorimotor subsystems such as the vestibular and body load sensing (BLS) somatosensory influences on head movement control during locomotion after long-duration space flight. Further we present data on the two motor learning processes during readaptation of locomotor function after long-duration space flight...|$|E
40|$|Why does {{water flow}} faster than honey? The short answer, that honey {{has a greater}} viscosity, merely rephrases the question. The {{fundamental}} answer is that viscosity originates in the interactions between a fluid s molecules. These interactions are so complicated that, except for low-density gases, the viscosity of a fluid cannot be accurately predicted. Progress in understanding viscosity has been made by studying moderately dense gases and, more recently, fluids near the critical point. Modern theories predict a universal behavior for all pure fluids near the liquid-vapor critical point, and they relate the increase in viscosity to spontaneous fluctuations in density near this point. The Critical Viscosity of Xenon (CVX) experiment tested these theories with unprecedented precision when it flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS- 85) in August 1997. Near the critical point, xenon is a billion times more compressible than water, yet it has about the same density. Because the fluid is so "soft," it collapses under its own weight when exposed to the force of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> - much like a very soft spring. Because the CVX experiment is conducted in microgravity, it achieves a very uniform fluid density even {{very close to the}} critical point. At the heart of the CVX experiment is a novel viscometer built around a small nickel screen. An oscillating electric field forces the screen to oscillate between pairs of electrodes. Viscosity, which dampens the oscillations, can be calculated by measuring the screen motion and the force applied to the screen. So that the fluid s delicate state near the critical point will not be disrupted, the screen oscillations are set to be both slow and small...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{weight-bearing}} {{caused by}} immobilization, bed-rest or microgravity leads to atrophy in mechanosensitive tissue such as muscle and bone. We hypothesize that bone tissue requires <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>gravity</b> (1 -g) {{for the maintenance}} of extracellular matrix, integrin, and kinase-mediated cell growth and survival pathways. We investigate the role of matrix-integrin signaling in bone cells using cell culture centrifugation to provide different levels of hypergravity mechanostimulation. The 10 - 50 -g range we use also mimics physiological intermedullary pressure (1. 2 - 5 kPa). 24 hours at 50 -g increased primary rat osteoblast proliferation on collagen Type I and fibronectin, but not laminin or uncoated plastic. BrdU incorporation in primary osteoblasts over 24 h showed hypergravity increased the number of cells actively synthesizing DNA from about 60 % at 1 -g to over 90 % at 25 -g. Primary rat fibroblasts grown at 50 -g (24 h) showed no proliferation increase, suggesting this is a tissue-specific phenomenon. These results suggest that the betal and alpha 4 integrins may be involved. To further test this, we used osteocytic-like MLO-Y 4 cells that showed increased proliferation at 1 -g with stable expression of a betal integrin cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain construct. At 50 -g, MLO-Y 4 /betal cells showed greater MAPK activation than MLO-Y 4 vector controls, suggesting that betal integrin is involved in transducing mitogenic signals in response to hypergravity. Preliminary results also show that interfering with the alpha 4 integrin in primary osteoblasts grown on fibronectin blocked the proliferation response. These results indicate that cells from mechanosensitive bone tissue can respond to gravity-generated forces, and this response involves specific matrix and integrin-dependent signaling pathways...|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} several hypotheses {{on the origin}} of volatile siderophile elements in the Earth. One hypothesis is that they were added during <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> accretion and core formation and mobilized into the metallic core [1], others claim multiple stage origin [2], while some hypothesize that volatiles were added after the core already formed [3]. Several volatile siderophile elements are depleted in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle relative to the chondrites, something which continues to puzzle many scientists. This depletion is likely due to a combination of volatility and core formation. The <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> core is composed of Fe and some lighter constituents, although the abundances of these lighter elements are unknown [4]. Si is one of these potential light elements [5] although few studies have analyzed the effect of Si on metal-silicate partitioning, in particular the volatile elements. As, In, Ge, and Sb are trace volatile siderophile elements which are depleted in the mantle but have yet to be extensively studied. The metal-silicate partition coefficients of these elements will be measured to determine the effect of Si. Partition coefficients depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition and can constrain the concentrations of volatile, siderophile elements found in the mantle. Reported here are the results from 13 experiments examining the partitioning of As, In, Ge, and Sb between metallic and silicate liquid. These experiments will examine the effect of temperature, and metal-composition (i. e., Si content) on these elements in or-der to gain a greater understanding of the core-mantle separation which occurred during the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> early stages. The data can then be applied to the origin of volatile elements in the Earth...|$|R
