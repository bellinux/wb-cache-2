5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal Secretary of State {{in many ways}} evolved from the roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, {{the power of the}} Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566–1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew and secretary of state were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E
