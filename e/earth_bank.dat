5|$|The {{station was}} {{positioned}} {{on the southern}} edge of Rushbeds Wood, a surviving part of the Bernwood Forest. It was on the western side of the level crossing over Kingswood Lane. Intended primarily for goods use, Wood Siding initially had no facilities for passengers, and the platform was simply a raised <b>earth</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around {{two sides of the}} courtyard. Of the outer court, only an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E
5|$|The inner bailey {{is reached}} using a {{bridge over the}} moat. The {{original}} castle bridge was constructed from wood but this was rebuilt with stone facades and piers in the late medieval period, and then subsequently replaced with an <b>earth</b> <b>bank,</b> further improved in the early 19th century; the current timber bridge dates from the 1960s. A gate house originally protected the entrance, with an arched passageway made from Roman brick, flanked by guardrooms; only the foundations now survive.|$|E
50|$|Knollbury is a {{scheduled}} neolithic enclosure {{to the north}} west of Chadlington in Oxfordshire. Believed to be defensive in nature the enclosure is rectangular (100 metres by 150 metres) formed by a two to four metre high and ten metre wide <b>earth</b> <b>banks.</b> The two gaps in the <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> at the eastern corners {{are believed to be}} of a later date.|$|R
50|$|It nests in tree cavities, {{especially}} old woodpecker holes. It {{may also}} nest in holes in <b>earth</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of two parallel <b>earth</b> <b>banks,</b> from 50 to 100 metres apart, the ground between being raised above the marsh on either side.|$|R
25|$|The {{remnants}} of a moat or ditch are discernible and {{the summit of the}} mote has a D-shaped concavity that is defended on the landward sides by a substantial and steep curved <b>earth</b> <b>bank.</b> 10m is the approximate internal width and the substantial <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> is up to 9m thick and has a height above the interior floor of 1.8m. The exterior height from ground level is around 5m. Beech tree plantings, natural scrub and a typical woodland sward covers the ring-work that was once ringed with a wood palisade rather than a stone wall.|$|E
25|$|Land {{forms are}} shown using contour lines with a contour {{interval}} of 5 metres. Additional symbols are provided to show e.g. <b>earth</b> <b>bank,</b> knoll, depression, small depression, pit, broken ground etc.|$|E
25|$|Located on the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} show ring and set into the <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> which rises up to the railway line is a toilet building. This houses female amenities and a baby change room. The walls are a combination of face brickwork and rendered masonry with high level fixed vent glass louvres. The roof consists of two intersecting gables and is clad with metal custom orb roof sheeting.|$|E
5|$|A set of <b>earth</b> <b>banks,</b> {{associated}} {{with one or}} other of the sieges, once stood where the Lawns stand, {{to the west of}} the castle.|$|R
50|$|Today it {{consists}} of two broad <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> separated by a ditch, originally almost six metres deep surrounding an enclosure of almost half a hectare.|$|R
50|$|This moss species {{occurs in}} the Flinders Ranges and Southern Lofty botanical regions of South Australia and in Victoria where it grows on <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> and near streams.|$|R
25|$|The {{first officer}} landed the {{aircraft}} at {{what appeared to}} be the runway threshold. It then came in contact with the <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> which ripped off all three undercarriage legs and the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly. The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines. One female passenger injured her leg. The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Swiss International Air Lines Flight 850 (LX 850) was an {{international}} scheduled passenger flight from Basle, Switzerland, to Hamburg, Germany. On 10 July 2002, {{the flight was}} unable to land at Fuhlsbüttel Airport due to weather. Attempts were made to divert to other airports at Berlin and Eberswalde before the crew decided to land at Werneuchen. On landing, the aircraft struck an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> which ripped off all three undercarriage legs, and {{came to rest on}} its belly with an engine on fire. One of the sixteen passengers suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was written off.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} phreatic or steam eruption {{was reported}} from Mount Binuluan in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people. Details about the eruption in 1952 are still scant. In 2007 and 2008, some 90- and 100-year-old elders in Brgy. Tulgao in Tinglayan said {{the loss of}} life in 1952 was caused by an eruption during a typhoon followed with the collapse of a natural <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> below Sugo-oc fumarole field, high on the northern side of the Bunog River. The consequent mudslide buried a few houses below near the villages of Dananao and Sumadel, Tinglayan, killing maybe 12 people or thereabouts.|$|E
50|$|There is a rhomboidal {{enclosure}} about 46 by 30 m of <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> and ditches about 70 m {{southwest of}} {{the centre of the}} banjo enclosure, at ST 4295 7373.|$|R
50|$|Wigmore {{was one of}} {{the first}} areas in England to have an Enclosure Act. Dating from 1772, this act {{affected}} the moor and woods nearby. The dividing <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> still survive.|$|R
50|$|This was {{formerly}} {{the garden of}} Combs Hall, which was demolished in 1756. Surviving features include <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> and a round pond, which has frogs, newts toads and many dragonflies. The meadow is grazed by sheep.|$|R
25|$|In 1400 the Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in {{rebellion}} against English rule, and took Beaumaris in 1403; {{the town was}} not recovered until 1405. In response the decision was taken by 1407 to build a town wall; ditches and an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> were constructed and by 1414 a stone wall had been built, with three gates {{and a number of}} probable towers. This necessitated the moving of a number of residents whose houses fell {{in the way of the}} new defences. Despite damage from the nearby sea in 1460, which resulted in some of the walls being rebuilt between 1536 and 1540, the walls were maintained until the late 17th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the weir, according to the Council minutes, was designed by the Council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and reinforced steel structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. Those activities were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area {{close to the edge}} of the top of the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|William {{built his}} castle on a rocky Magnesian Limestone spur {{surrounded}} by steep banks, and the fortification included a motte, an inner bailey protected by an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> and palisades, an outer bailey, {{and possibly a}} timber keep. The castle was located around [...] above the river and would have dominated {{this part of the}} Don Valley. It was positioned directly opposite the village, which probably contained the old Anglo-Saxon burh.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} <b>earth</b> <b>banks,</b> {{channels}} and pond bays {{have not been}} dated but {{are believed to be}} associated with a former mill. These earthworks extend for 200m {{to the west of the}} castle along the banks of the River Stort.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the twentieth century the {{terraces}} were simply <b>earth</b> <b>banks,</b> often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of railways sleepers were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on.|$|R
50|$|The mountains, much {{of which}} are unenclosed moorland or low-grade grazing with areas of bog, are {{surrounded}} by farmland and active or deserted farms. Field boundaries tend to be <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> topped with fencing and stock-resistant plants such as gorse.|$|R
500|$|A ditch was cut {{along the}} western site of the castle, between [...] and [...] wide, and an <b>earth</b> <b>bank,</b> or dam, [...] high was built to the south-east; these allowed {{the area around the}} castle to be flooded, forming a large, shallow lake or moat. A similar design of moat can be seen at Ravensworth Castle. Fishponds were {{constructed}} as part of the complex, linked to the moat.|$|E
500|$|Public baths {{were built}} in 1861 {{just north of the}} current Parliament House. They were {{supplied}} with reticulated water from the Torrens and progressively upgraded with the last change a 1940 remodelling including an Olympic size swimming pool and diving tower. The baths were demolished in 1970 {{to make way for the}} Adelaide Festival Centre. The [...] Millbrook Reservoir was constructed high in the Adelaide Hills from 1913 to 1918 submerging the town of Millbrook. An <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> dam fed by mile long tunnel from a weir on the river at Gumeracha, its elevation allows gravity supply of water to Adelaide's eastern suburbs.|$|E
500|$|Canterbury {{city walls}} are a {{sequence}} of defensive walls built around the city of Canterbury in Kent, England. The first city walls were built by the Romans, probably between 270 and 280 AD. These walls were constructed from stone {{on top of an}} <b>earth</b> <b>bank,</b> and protected by a ditch and wall towers. At least five gates were placed into the walls, linked to the network of Roman roads across the region. With the collapse of Roman Britain, Canterbury went into decline but the walls remained, and may have influenced the decision of Augustine to settle in the city {{at the end of the}} 6th century. The Anglo-Saxons retained the defensive walls, building chapels over most of the gates and using them to defend Canterbury against Viking incursions.|$|E
25|$|On completion, {{the rather}} awkward {{structure}} had {{a capacity of}} 50,000. The main stand running along {{the north of the}} site seated 3,000. The remaining 47,000 spectators were accommodated on terracing constructed on <b>earth</b> <b>banking.</b> When it opened the stadium was originally called Harringay Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} started at 2pm over a course almost {{identical}} to the modern Grand National course, although the fences were all no more than 2 ft high <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> with the exceptions of two brooks and a water jump {{in front of the}} stands.|$|R
50|$|Ice {{houses have}} been {{associated}} with Ley tunnels because they gave the appearance to poorly educated observers in years gone by as being likely entrances to mysterious tunnels, being ancient in appearance, built into <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> with strong doors, and located near to castles, abbeys, etc.|$|R
500|$|Church Siding was {{immediately}} west of Wotton. It {{was treated as}} a station during the Tramway's early years and listed as such in timetables, but was never redeveloped following the conversion to locomotive haulage and its [...] "platform" [...] remained an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> with no buildings. Trains heading down the Quainton Road–Brill line would pause {{at the entrance to the}} siding, and any wagons intended for the siding would be detached and hauled down the siding by rope. It ceased to be listed in timetables in September 1894, although there is some evidence that passenger trains ceased to make scheduled stops at Church Siding before this date. Freight trains are recorded as stopping at Church Siding to load goods as late as 1899. Church Siding was the scene of the Tramway's only fatal accident, on 8 March 1883.|$|E
500|$|The Canterbury {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times. Lower Paleolithic axes, and Neolithic and Bronze Age pots {{have been found in}} the area. Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the Celtic tribe of the Cantiaci, which inhabited most of modern-day Kent. In the 1st century AD, the Romans captured the settlement and named it Durovernum Cantiacorum. The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets in a grid pattern, a theatre, a temple, a forum, and public baths. Although they did not maintain a major military garrison, its position on Watling Street relative to the major Kentish ports of Rutupiae (Richborough), Dubrae (Dover), and Lemanae (Lymne) gave it considerable strategic importance. In the late 3rd century, to defend against attack from barbarians, the Romans built an <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> around the city and a wall with seven gates, which enclosed an area of [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} a crude <b>earth</b> <b>bank</b> [...] high, {{held in place}} by wooden planks, but it was later rebuilt. The station was equipped with a short level platform, and a small [...] square goods shed. The main users of the goods facilities appear to have been the local dairy farms; in the 1880s, prior to the transfer to Metropolitan Railway operation, Wotton station was handling from 45,000 to 60,000 gallons (200,000 to 270,000l; 54,000 to 72,000USgal) of milk each year. The passenger station building itself was a wooden hut with an iron roof, [...] long by [...] wide, including a waiting room, a booking office and male and female toilet facilities. Until the early 20th century the station porter was required to keep a three-gallon kettle on the boil for foot warmers, should the passengers require them. A pair of small cottages were built near the station to house Tramway employees.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{runs through}} a cutting, design by Brunel. Owing {{to the risk}} of {{landslip}} from the <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> of this cutting, Brunel designed four flying arches to hold the cutting walls apart. For extra stability, these arches were ballasted with high mounds of copper slag.|$|R
50|$|The plateau's {{exposure}} to the winds of the sea may account {{for one of the}} features of the rural architecture of the region; the plain, unadorned farmhouses in farmsteads, typically enclosed by high <b>earth</b> <b>banks,</b> walls and a sheltering square of trees. (see also Architecture of Normandy).|$|R
50|$|On the {{northern}} {{bank of the}} Eastern Cleddau, the foreshore is of mud, marsh and rocks. Slebech has extensive deciduous woodland and open farmland. Fields are large and regular and are divided by <b>earth</b> <b>banks</b> topped with hedges. Agriculture land use is improved pasture with {{a small proportion of}} arable crops.|$|R
