50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> {{is that the}} ring gear of the differential and the input pinion gear are both hypoid.

50|$|In older {{automotive}} designs, <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{were typically}} used in rear-drive automobile drivetrains, but modern designs {{have tended to}} substitute spiral bevel gears to increase driving efficiency.|$|R
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{exception}} to this is the Torsen differential, which uses worms and planetary worm gears {{in place of the}} bevel gearing of conventional open differentials. Torsen differentials are most prominently featured in the HMMWV and some commercial Hummer vehicles, and as a centre differential in some all wheel drive systems, such as Audi's quattro. Very heavy trucks, such as those used to carry aggregates, often use a worm gear differential for strength. The worm drive is not as efficient as a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear,</b> and such trucks invariably have a very large differential housing, with a correspondingly large volume of gear oil, to absorb and dissipate the heat created.|$|E

The engines are mated to a front-wheel-drive transaxle. There is no center differential. The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device. Power coming from the engine is transferred via a central <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> that delivers power to each rear axle. Power to the each axle is modulated by identical planetary gear sets and electromagnetic clutch packs which can vary incoming power side to side.|$|E

50|$|In 1927, Gleason Works again led the {{innovation}} in this market, {{as it was}} the first machine tool builder to create machine tools to cut <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> (which are an advanced variant of spiral bevel gears).|$|R
50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> with more efficient spiral bevel gears in automotive use because the spiral bevel gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque. Increasing {{the size of the}} drive axle gear would require an increase {{of the size of the}} gear housing and a reduction in the ground clearance.|$|R

50|$|Hypoid gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. Hypoid gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Acura RL sedan, introduced in late 2004 as a 2005 model, {{was the first}} production implementation of SH-AWD. It is the most mechanically complex, and probably the heaviest implementation of SH-AWD. The RL is powered by either a 3.5L 290 hp VTEC variable valve timing and lift V-6 (2005-2008) or a 3.7L 300 hp VTEC V-6 (2009-2010) transverse mounted {{in the manner of}} a typical Honda front-wheel-drive car. In fact, the RL uses a highly modified version of the Honda Global Midsize platform, versions of which exist for the Honda Accord, Acura TSX and Acura TL. However, the front transaxle is directly coupled to a torque transfer unit. Within the torque transfer unit is a short horizontal shaft and a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> set which turn the propeller shaft ninety degrees and moves it to the vehicle center line. An RL unique, two piece lightweight carbon fiber reinforced drive shaft carries power to the rear differential unit. Torque vectoring takes place in the rear differential which contains three planetary gear and clutch sets. Torque from the driveshaft passes through the differential's first clutch/planetary gearset, which as a unit is called the Acceleration Device. Two identical clutch/planetary gearsets power each rear wheel. The rear wheels are always overdriven with respect to the speed of the front wheels. The Acceleration Device can variably overdrive the rear wheel speed up to 5.7%.|$|E

The conference web pages are at: [URL] multi-physics approach {{to investigate the}} dynamics and tribology of differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is presented in this work. A multi-body dynamics model of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> has been developed using ADAMS commercial software. The stiffness and damping of the lubricant film are key parameters for the system dynamics. They establish the coupling between dynamics and tribology of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> The stiffness of the lubricant film depends on its rheological state under the prevailing dynamic conditions. At low loads, a hydrodynamic regime of lubrication is prevalent and the lubricant film exhibits compressible behaviour. Therefore, the lubricant film stiffness can be the determining factor in the overall contact stiffness and it may well contribute to the system damping. At high loads, an Elasto-hydrodynamic regime of lubrication is prevalent (EHL), where the lubricant film behaves as incompressible body. EHL conditions present insignificant damping and relatively high stiffness {{in a way that}} if the only aim is to obtain the system dynamics, then the assumption of dry elastostatic Hertzian contact may be sufficient. Therefore, an iterative solution between tribology and the dynamics is required. Time restrictions are forcing the use of extrapolated equations for the tribological calculations coupled with the dynamic model. In parallel, a fully numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been developed, taking into account non-Newtonian and thermal effects. In the case of highly loaded teeth contacts, a mixed regime of lubrication is encountered due to thin films. The EHL model predicts the film thickness and power loss in a quasi-static manner (by following some snapshots during a typical meshing cycle). These calculations give detailed distributions of pressure, temperature and film thickness between the contacting teeth. Therefore, the numerical model is suitably developed to produce information about the energy consumed by the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> To conclude, on one hand tribological predictions are essential for studying the system’s parasitic losses (efficiency). On the other hand, dynamic modelling returns the transient behaviour of the gear pair (dynamic transmission error) which is a predictive tool for Noise, Vibration and Harshness behaviour...|$|R
