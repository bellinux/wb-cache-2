50|$|A {{hearing on}} a writ of audita querela {{was a full}} trial {{on the merits of}} the case, rather than a simple {{procedural}} hearing, and could result in both equitable remedies as well as summary judgment. The expense of pursuing a full trial was one of the factors that led to the writ's decline by the late 1660s, particularly as many plaintiffs only sought summary judgment, and English courts became more willing to entertain much cheaper to pursue motions for summary judgment. Two English statutes in particular, in allowing relatively simple affidavits in <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> to secure summary judgment, led to an increase in their use in place of audita querela: the Charities Procedure Act 1812 and the Summary Procedure on Bills of Exchange Act 1855. The former granted several English courts greater liberty to review affidavits and award summary relief in cases involving charitable trusts. The latter permitted bearers of promissory notes and endorsed bills of exchange to pursue <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> for summary judgment through the filing of an affidavit.|$|E

40|$|On September 30, 2013, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board {{issued a}} troubling {{decision}} in In re Bottega Veneta Int’l S. a. r. l. Viewed {{in a broader}} context, the decision reflects the Board’s growing reluctance to apply the doctrine of “aesthetic functionality” in <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> prosecution <b>proceedings</b> to bar the issuance of potentially anticompetitive trade-dress registrations. The TTAB gives its imprimatur to the dubious “trade dress” at issue in Bottega Veneta through procedural tactics whose novelty and import have gone largely unacknowledged — specifically, (1) the Board’s declaration of its intention to resolve “doubts” as to aesthetic functionality in favor of applicants, and (2) the Board’s disposal of concerns about product-design monopolization through reliance on supposedly limiting conditions agreed to by the applicant, but which the federal courts will not observe or enforce. As such, In re Bottega Veneta — despite its technical status as a mere “non-precedential” decision by an agency whose determination can theoretically be revisited by the federal courts — will improperly hinder marketplace competition and restrict creative freedom among designers. For a proposal that the courts and USPTO rely more heavily on the doctrine of 2 ̆ 2 genericism 2 ̆ 2 as a potential solution to {{the problems associated with}} the 2 ̆ 2 aesthetic functionality 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, please visit the Law of Fashion website — containing a presentation given at the NYU 2014 Tri-State IP Workshop and forming the basis for a full-length work-in-progress...|$|R
5000|$|State courts vary {{in their}} use of <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> (for example, in custody cases, {{replevin}} cases and other civil matters), though most have it in one form or another. For example, in the States of California and Illinois, <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> are available if notice is given before 10 a.m. the previous court day, or even shorter upon showing of emergency need. [...] As most courts in these two states hold law and motion hearings in the early morning, this notice is typically confirmed by facsimile although oral notice may be effective. Some courts in California have procedures to allow opponents to appear telephonically, while other courts do not allow any oral argument and only consider written papers. In California, party who files an ex parte application must file a declaration showing compliance with these requirements, and no relief may be granted absent such declaration. In addition to the notice requirements, an ex parte application must contain an affirmative actual showing in a declaration based on personal knowledge of [...] "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte".|$|E
5000|$|If {{an appeal}} is lodged against a {{decision}} in <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> (i.e., proceedings involving only one party) and if the first instance department which took the decision regards the appeal to be admissible and well founded, it has to rectify its decision. This is a so-called [...] "interlocutory revision", which {{is said to be}} a rather unusual procedure within the EPO. This is a very useful procedure for example if amendments are filed with the appeal, which clearly overcome the objections in the first instance decision. If the appeal is not allowed by the first instance department within three months of receipt of the statement of grounds, the first instance department has to transfer the case to the Board of Appeal without delay, and without comment as to its merit.|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, argued Kayton, {{the fact}} that the Third Circuit and the judge in the similar Texas case {{disagreed}} over whether Monsanto was just [...] "putting its best foot forward" [...] or instead was intentionally defrauding the Patent Office indicates that reasonable men can differ: [...] "This being so, is it not an inescapable conclusion [...] [...] [...] that the Monsanto patent solicitor's conduct [...] [...] [...] was at worst a nonculpable mistake of judgment?" [...] Again, co-author Stern disagreed: [...] "No. The Third Circuit, on the contrary, appears to have thought that Judge Singleton's views were plainly erroneous, and that his acceptance of the patentee's theory that 'it is all right to put your best foot forward with the Patent Office' was contrary to the legal standard as to candor required in <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> of this type. Given so thoroughly erroneous a concept of the standard of candor, it is neither surprising that in the circumstancesof this case the judge using that legal standard found no fraud nor surprising that the judges rejecting it found fraud." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{effectiveness of}} this procedure mainly resides {{in that it is}} ex parte and restrictive. The authorisation to perform a saisie-contrefaçon is requested of the President of the tribunal de grande instance with jurisdiction over the territory in question, in <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Yet Article R. 211-7 of the French Judicial Organisation Code provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for actions in the fields of Community designs and trademarks. The proceedings are ex parte, i.e. without hearing the other party: the requesting party, represented by its attorney-at-law, presents its request to the judge; the person targeted by the saisie-contrefaçon measure is not informed and does not take part in the proceedings. Therefore, the saisie-contrefaçon ordered by the judge will benefit from the element of surprise; until the very last moment, the targeted person is not informed {{of what is going on}} and therefore cannot move or dispose of the evidence of its infringing activity (the result is the same when, in matters of copyright and related rights, a police commissioner, or even a judge, is requested to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon, see French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1 and L. 332-4). The great practical effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon also lies in its restrictive nature, since the judge, by granting an order to perform a saisie-contrefaçon, authorises the requesting party to call upon a bailiff to enter the premises of the targeted person or even of third parties (if evidence is likely to be found there) to perform the saisie-contrefaçon investigations, regardless of whether or not the premises are normally open to the public.|$|E
40|$|The Financial Industry Regulatory Association (“FINRA”) {{maintains}} {{a database of}} customer complaints regarding individuals licensed by FINRA as registered representatives. Both securities regulators and the investing public can access and use the data {{to find out about}} past customer complaints of the registered representatives. However, records of customer complaints can be expunged from the database through an arbitration process that FINRA created. This Article traces the history of that arbitration process and focuses on how it is employed in cases where the investor was paid money to settle a claim. The Article studies FINRA arbitrations in such cases and reveals that customer complaints regarding claims that later settled are being expunged at the rate of 93. 7 %, often in perfunctory <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>proceedings</b> where the complainant has agreed to not oppose the application as part of the settlement. This Article concludes with a proposal for necessary changes to the expungement process in order for the FINRA database to maintain its integrity...|$|E
