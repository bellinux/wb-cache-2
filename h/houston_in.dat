5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. <b>Houston</b> <b>in</b> particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with <b>Houston</b> <b>in</b> June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E

Following Texas' {{independence from}} Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth was centered initially on agriculture and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and <b>Houston</b> <b>in</b> the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers.|$|E
