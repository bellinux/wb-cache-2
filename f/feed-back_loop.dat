40|$|National audienceMany Embedded Systems are {{supposed}} to run continuously, which includes recovering from errors by adapting their configuration or their architecture to changing conditions in their environment. The design of such systems has to relate some high-level extra-functional properties to some low level ones such as memory or CPU consumption by defining some complex <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> for the dynamic adaptation of the system. However, although <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> (also known as ``adaptation policies'') are a well-known idea, the design phase does not deal with those <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> and thus the needed sensors and actuators are hard-coded during the development phase. This leads to expensive roll-back operations in the design process. To avoid that, we suggest a model-driven process based on new executable meta-modelling techniques. At modelling time, designers have to complement the architectural description with some sensors and actuators related to the involved extra-functional properties. It allows designers to specify in a consistent way the related adaptation policies. Then, since the models are executable, some simulations of the adaptation policies can be performed at design time to evaluate their performances with respect to some relevant test scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|The {{reformulation}} of sociocybernetics as an [...] "actor-oriented, observer-dependent, self-steering, time-variant" [...] {{paradigm of}} human systems, was most clearly articulated by Geyer and van der Zouwen in 1978 and 1986. They stated that sociocybernetics {{is more than}} just social cybernetics, which could be defined as the application of the general systems approach to social science. Social cybernetics is indeed more than such a one-way knowledge transfer. It implies a <b>feed-back</b> <b>loop</b> from the area of application - the social sciences - to the theory being applied, namely cybernetics; consequently, sociocybernetics can indeed be viewed as part of the new cybernetics: {{as a result of its}} application to social science problems, cybernetics, itself, has been changed and has moved from its originally rather mechanistic point of departure to become more actor-oriented and observer-dependent.In summary, the new sociocybernetics is much more subjective and the sociological approach than the classical cybernetics approach with its emphasis on control. The new approach has a distinct emphasis on steering decisions; furthermore, it can be seen as constituting a reconceptualization of many concepts which are often routinely accepted without challenge.|$|E
50|$|In humans, IL-10 is encoded by the IL10 gene, {{which is}} located on {{chromosome}} 1 and comprises 5 exons, and is primarily produced by monocytes and, to a lesser extent, lymphocytes, namely type 2 T helper cells (TH2), mast cells, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, and in a certain subset of activated T cells and B cells. IL-10 can be produced by monocytes upon PD-1 triggering in these cells. The expression of IL-10 is minimal in unstimulated tissues and seems to require triggering by commensal or pathogenic flora. IL-10 expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Extensive IL-10 locus remodeling is observed in monocytes upon stimulation of TLR or Fc receptor pathways. IL-10 induction involves ERK1/2, p38 and NF-κB signalling and transcriptional activation via promoter binding of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. IL-10 may autoregulate its expression via a negative <b>feed-back</b> <b>loop</b> involving autocrine stimulation of the IL-10 receptor and inhibition of the p38 signaling pathway. Additionally, IL-10 expression is extensively regulated at the post-transcriptional level, which may involve control of mRNA stability via AU-rich elements and by microRNAs such as let-7 or miR-106.|$|E

40|$|The mTOR pathway is aberrantly stimulated in many cancer cells, {{including}} pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), {{and thus}} it is a potential target for therapy. However, the mTORC 1 /S 6 K axis also mediates negative feedback loops that attenuate signaling via insulin/IGF receptor and other tyrosine kinase receptors. Suppression of these <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> unleashes over-activation of upstream pathways that potentially counterbalance the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of PANC- 1 or MiaPaCa- 2 pancreatic cancer cells with either rapamycin or active-site mTOR inhibitors suppressed S 6 K and S 6 phosphorylation induced by insulin and the GPCR agonist neurotensin. Rapamycin caused a striking increase in Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473 while the active-site inhibitors of mTOR (KU 63794 and PP 242) completely abrogated Akt phosphorylation at this site. Conversely, active-site inhibitors of mTOR cause a marked increase in ERK activation whereas rapamycin {{did not have any}} stimulatory effect on ERK activation. The results imply that first and second generation of mTOR inhibitors promote over-activation of different pro-oncogenic pathways in PDAC cells, suggesting that suppression of <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> should be a major consideration in the use of these inhibitors for PDAC therapy. In contrast, metformin abolished mTORC 1 activation without over-stimulating Akt phosphorylation on Ser 473 and prevented mitogen-stimulated ERK activation in PDAC cells. Metformin induced a more pronounced inhibition of proliferation than either KU 63794 or rapamycin while, the active-site mTOR inhibitor was more effective than rapamycin...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} general structure from motion problem. That is, how to compute in an unconstrained environment 3 D scene structure, camera motion and moving objects from video sequences. We present a framework which uses concatenated <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> {{to overcome the}} main difficulty in the structure from motion problem: the chicken-and-egg dilemma between scene segmentation and structure recovery. The idea is that we compute structure and motion in stages by gradually computing 3 D scene information of increasing complexity and using processes which operate on increasingly large spatial image areas. Within this framework, we developed three modules. First, we introduce a new constraint for the estimation of shape using image features from multiple views. We analyze this constraint and show that noise leads to unavoidable mis-estimation of the shape, which also predicts the erroneous shape perception in human. This insight provides a clear argument for the need for <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops.</b> Second, a novel constraint on shape is developed which allows us to connect multiple frames in the estimation of camera motion by matching only small image patches. Third, we present a texture descriptor for matching areas of extended sizes. The advantage of this texture descriptor, {{which is based on}} fractal geometry, lies in its invariance to any smooth mapping (Bi-Lipschitz transform) including changes of viewpoint, illumination and surface distortion. Finally, we apply our framework to the problem of super-resolution imaging. We use the 3 D motion estimation together with a novel wavelet-based reconstruction scheme to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution images...|$|R

The design of such systems has to relate some high-level extra-functional properties to some low level ones such as memory or CPU consumption by defining some complex <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> for the dynamic adaptation of the system. However, the design of such <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> (also called ``adaptation policies'') {{is still a very}} complex endeavour {{if you want to go}} beyond predefined fallback modes. Since the expression of extra-functional properties and the design of adaptation policies are complex activities, they are generally delayed down to implementation time. Adaptation policies are then implemented without either high level design nor dedicated tests, which may lead to costly roll-back operations in the design process. To avoid such roll-back operations, we suggest a model-driven process based on new executable meta-modelling techniques. At modelling time, designers have to complement the architectural description with some sensors and actuators related to the involved extra-functional properties. It allows designers to specify in a consistent way the related adaptation policies. Then since the model is executable, some simulations of the adaptation policies can be performed at design time to evaluate their performances with respect to some relevant test scenarios. Then, using model-driven transformations, it allows the generation of code skeletons for real-time embedded platforms.

Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form <b>feed-back</b> <b>loops</b> that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures.
