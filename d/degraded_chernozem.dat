The field experiment was conducted on very good wheat soil complex (<b>degraded</b> <b>chernozem</b> formed from loess) in the years 2006 - 2009. The analysed factors were NPK fertilization with 150; 300; 450 kg·ha- 1 and non-fertilized treatment. The second order factor was three maize cultivars: early Fido c. v., medium early Grom c. v. and medium late –PR 38 F 70. Increase in mineral fertilization (NPK) level influenced a growth of maize grain yield from 8. 39 t·ha- 1 on the non-fertilized treatment to 10. 69 t·ha- 1 after the application of the highest fertilizer dose...|$|E

Nitrogenous fertilizers were applied at the growth phase of the 6 th leaf (Zadoks = 29). Four various forms of fertilizers were exemined: urea solution, DAM- 390, DAM- 390 + Dumag, DASA. Different weather conditions statistically highly significantly influenced grain yield in respective experimental years. Topdressing with nitrogen (30 kg N. ha– 1) caused statistically highly significant increase of grain yield in all fertilized variants ranging from + 0. 29  t. ha– 1 (applied of DAM- 390) to + 0. 69  t. ha– 1 (applied of DASA) according to respective treatments. Average grain yield in unfertilized control variant represented 7. 23  t. ha– 1. Nitrogen nutrition showed positive effect on the main macroelements offtake (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) by winter wheat grain in all fertilized variants.

The status of biota of old-arable chernozems in conditions of the green manure applications has been evaluated statistically. Two experimental sites located in the central and southern zone of the Republic of Moldova have been tested by soil biological indicators during 2010 - 2012. The application of vetch as a green manure had created conditions for the improvement of the biota's vital activity in chernozems which had been degraded {{as a result of a}} long-term arable use. The number of invertebrates increased from 48. 1 - 55. 0 to 71. 6 - 78. 0 ex m- 2, the number of Lumbricidae family - from 25. 6 - 38. 0 to 43. 3 - 68. 0 ex m- 2. The effect of green manure was manifested in the increase of share of Lumbricidae family in the total number of invertebrates by 12. 1 - 20. 8 %. The microbial biomass content in the arable layer of soils rose up in average by 1. 4 - 1. 5 times. The humification processes intensified as a result of the interaction between the fresh organic matter and the soil biota. Biological parameters did not reach the level of soils under natural vegetation.

40|$|In {{this study}} we compare some {{chemical}} and biological soil properties using the organic and conventional systems. In 2003 and 2004 the soil characteristics were observed on the precise field experiment plots in Borovce (near Piešťany, {{in the western part}} of the Slovak Republic) where organic management has taken place since 1995. The soil representative is loam and clay, loam <b>degraded</b> <b>Chernozem</b> on loess. The chemical and biological soil properties were determined within two farming systems: organic and conventional. The lower values of soil reaction and the higher contents of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen in the soil were measured under organic treatment. Organic management also positively affected a number of the cellulolytic and ammonification bacteria as well as microbial biomass content, ammonification and nitrification activity. The earthworm population was more developed at the organic variant. During the years 2003 and 2004, after eight years of organic management utilisation, the tendency of increased biological activity in the soil under organic management was observed...|$|E
40|$|Summary. This article {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of natural and artificial humic acids on zinc and cadmium toxicity for pea plants (Pisum sativum L.). The research was carried out in water cul-tures on the modified Knopp substrate. Toxic quantities of Zn and Cd were added to the substrate in the form of soluble nitrogen salts. Two natural humic acids were prepared from Luvisol and de-graded chernozems. Artificial humic acids came from Aldrich company. Different influence of both natural and artificial humic acids point out to three mechanisms: (i) difference of cation ex-change capacity and amounts of carboxilic and phenolic groups of all amendments; (ii) chemical properties of zinc and cadmium ions; (iii) ratio between amount of three types of humic acids and metal contents. Humic acids from Aldrich company were a factor determining zinc and cadmium activity for pea plants. Humic acids from <b>degraded</b> <b>chernozem</b> caused a decrease of cadmium activity of investigated plans. Key words: humic acids, zinc and cadmium toxicity, pea plant...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the energy use in cereal crop {{rotation}} in conventional and organic farming system in terms of additional energy inputs, gross energy production, energy profit and energy efficiency evaluation in years 2003 – 2005 in the stationary field experiment established on <b>degraded</b> <b>Chernozem</b> on loess in a maize – barley growing region in south west Slovakia (near Piešťany town). Increased energy inputs caused the increase of production in the Conventional Farming System. The Conventional System was more energy demanding (about 52. 5 %) in comparison with the ecological one. The most energy demanding crops were those amended by farm yard manure: maize for grain (21. 31 GJ ha- 1 in the organic system, 34. 18 GJ ha- 1 in the conventional system) and winter wheat (17. 20 GJ ha- 1 in the organic system, 24. 60 GJ ha- 1 in the conventional system).

40|$|Among legumes, pea (Pisum sativum L.) is {{the second}} most {{important}} grain legume crop in the world, which is widely used both in human nutrition and as fodder. The yield potential of cultivars {{is one of the major}} factors that determine the use of field pea. Currently, pre-sowing inoculation of pea seeds is a promising treatment and is one of agronomic solutions for sustainable agriculture development. The objective of the research was to estimate the productivity of the ‘afila’ and ‘semileafs’ morphotypes of field pea, depending on different inoculants based on symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) -commercial (Nitragine TM) and noncommercial, produced by the Polish Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation (IUNG). The research was based on the precise field experiment, conducted in four replicates and carried out in the experimental field of Bayer® company located in Modzurów, Silesian viovodeship. The experimental field soil was classified as Umbrisol-slightly <b>degraded</b> <b>chernozem,</b> formed from loess. The examined inoculants were applied during sowing. The presented results of the studies on the symbiotic nitrogen fixation by leguminous plants indicate that the productivity of pea was positively affected by the application of IUNG (noncommercial) inoculant. On the other hand, it is not recommended to use Nitragine TM separately, as it inhibits the growth of pea.
