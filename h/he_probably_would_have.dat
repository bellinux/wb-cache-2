5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{began playing}} with the Melbourne Cricket Club in the 1890–91 season. He played two premiership matches early in the season, against Port Melbourne and Richmond, but scored only 13 runs in two innings and was not called upon to bowl. He did not play in another senior premiership game until the next season. In a match against Wesley College in March 1891, he played a high quality innings, scoring 121 runs. Several weeks later, while playing for MCC's seconds against South Melbourne's seconds, he took 13 wickets for 61 runs. The Tasmanian noted that it was pity he had not played that well earlier in the season, or <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> secured a {{permanent}} place in the first XI.|$|E
25|$|Woolley {{proved to}} be a good wicket-keeper, and had his career not paralleled that of Rod Marsh <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> played more {{international}} cricket. In the 1982–83 season Woolley scored 551 runs at 42.38 and took 39 catches and two stumpings, and he got his chance for Australia when Marsh was unavailable for the brief tour of Sri Lanka in April 1983. He played in all four one-day matches and the single Test, becoming Tasmania's first Test player since its entry to the Sheffield Shield. Australia so dominated the Test match in Kandy that he was not needed to bat, but he took five catches in the innings victory.|$|E
50|$|Lolita {{polarized}} contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, {{that if he}} {{had realized}} how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> made the film.|$|R
60|$|As {{the night}} was dark Everingham could see nothing of His Eminence's {{expression}} of face. If <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> seen the same mask of polite blandness which the Cardinal usually wore.|$|R
5000|$|Sergei Rachmaninoff also {{composed}} a symphonic poem, Isle of the Dead, Op. 29 (1909), {{inspired by a}} black-and-white print of the painting. He said that had he seen the colour original, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> written the music.|$|R
25|$|Although Mani {{was blamed}} and {{ultimately}} fired for Velocity's advert having the wrong focus, {{it had in}} fact been Ansell that initially mentioned the concierge aspect to the team. However, Ruth decided to bring Mani back instead, as though Ansell had apologised off-camera and admitted his mistake during the initial boardroom, Mani also mentioned the service, and was extremely rude to Ruth throughout the task, with his refusal to accept any blame for the misleading briefing being a contributing factor to his firing. On his appearance on You're Fired! Mani later admitted that if Ansell hadn't mentioned the concierge service, then <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
25|$|After over a year, Kidd {{was sent}} to England for {{questioning}} by the Parliament of England. The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd {{as a tool to}} discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison, and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 the Grand Nationals {{at least}} as far as the {{professionals}} were concerned was a one-event championship. Instead of how much was won over the year, the Pros were required to attend at least eight nationals with the top 28 money-winning pros, A or AA, eligible to compete in a special pro Car main in which the winning pro would receive a 1983 General Motors Pontiac Trans Am automobile and the title no. 1 Pro for 1982, continuing the new tradition of giving the number one pro a Trans Am. Kevin McNeal, No. 1 Pro for 1981 also received one, so did Brian's brother Brent in 1980. Brian Patterson was the pro who had earned the most money prior to the Grand National with $3,694 in winnings, so if the previous system of winning the number one plate was still in force, depending on how he did <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won under the old system. Indeed, the situation would have been similar to Kevin McNeal, Brian Patterson had maintained the money lead since May.|$|E
60|$|If {{any other}} person than Norris <b>had</b> asked him, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> accepted.|$|R
25|$|Although not {{released}} until 1992 due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has {{also stated that}} if 386BSD had been available at the time, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> created Linux.|$|R
50|$|From {{a formal}} {{point of view}} the sonatina is Satie's most outspoken neoclassical composition. It {{is one of the}} {{exceptional}} piano compositions he wrote down with bar lines, which <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> done if not for making an explicit reference to classicism.|$|R
500|$|The Advisory Board was reconstituted {{in part as}} a {{permanent}} Natural Sciences Advisory Board to the NPS. In 1964, Wirth's successor, George B. Hartzog Jr., established the Division of Natural Science Studies, naming biologist George Sprugel Jr. the Service's chief scientist. The memorable idea of a [...] "vignette of primitive America" [...] drew popular attention from readers and the report received widespread publicity and praise amongst conservationists. It was reprinted in several national publications and was also noted in the Sierra Club Bulletin. Leopold often said that had he known the report would be widely read and dissected, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> written it more carefully.|$|E
500|$|Wiescamp showed Skipper W as a halter horse {{three times}} when the {{stallion}} was four years old. Skipper W was named grand champion stallion at the three shows he attended, the 1948 National Western Stock Show in Denver, the 1948 Colorado State Fair, and the 1948 New Mexico State Fair. Wiescamp later remarked that [...] "I'm glad now that we didn't show him more, because {{he would have been}} before the public so much that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been sold." [...] However, Skipper W's American Quarter Horse Association, or AQHA, show record does not show any record of these wins, which is not unusual for horses shown in the 1940s, as the record keeping was not always the best {{during the early years of}} the AQHA.|$|E
500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{receives}} the mail {{of her new}} neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm). After going through it, she believes he is the perfect man for her. To try and woo him, she follows the actions of an evil Spanish soap character called [...] "The Generalissimo" [...] from Los Amantes Clandestinos, despite the warnings of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Elisa (Salma Hayek). She invites Drew to a nonexistent party, and, when he arrives expecting a party, she informs him that the party is scheduled for the following evening, but nevertheless invites him in. While this plan initially appears to work, things go wrong when Liz accidentally gives Drew Rohypnol and he finds some of his opened mail in her handbag. The next day Drew receives some of Liz's mail and reads it. He says that based on her mail <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted to meet Liz, {{in the same vein}} as she had wanted to meet him. They decide to start with a clean slate and go on a real date.|$|E
50|$|Everyone {{knows the}} adage... Had Bonaparte been a Latin scholar <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> {{reversed}} it and said, Si vis bellum para pacem.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{wished he}} could have taken Psmith into his confidence. <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> volunteered to come, too; Mike <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been glad of a companion.|$|R
60|$|Harris {{thought it}} was lucky for him the man had not mistaken him for a relation, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> been drowned outright.|$|R
2500|$|Around 5:00p.m., Lennon and Ono {{left the}} Dakota for a {{recording}} session at Record Plant Studios. As they walked toward their limousine, Chapman {{shook hands with}} Lennon and asked for him to sign {{a copy of his}} album, Double Fantasy. Amateur photographer Paul Goresh took a photo of Lennon signing Chapman's album. [...] Chapman later {{said in an interview that}} he tried to get Goresh to stay, and that he asked another Lennon fan lingering at the building's entrance to go out with him that night. He suggested that if the girl had accepted his invitation, or the photographer had stayed, he would not have murdered Lennon that evening; but <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> tried another day.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Crippen and Le Neve were {{crossing}} the Atlantic on Montrose, with Le Neve {{disguised as a}} boy. Captain Henry George Kendall recognized the fugitives and, just before steaming beyond the range of his ship-board transmitter, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless telegram to the British authorities: [...] "Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl." [...] Had Crippen travelled third class, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> escaped Kendall's notice. Dew boarded a faster White Star liner, , from Liverpool and arrived in Quebec, Canada, ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Petty Officer John Washak {{said that}} {{right after the}} blast, a senior chief petty officer ordered him to turn an M-60 machine gun on Coles fantail away from a second small boat approaching. [...] "With blood still on my face", he said, he was told: [...] "That's the rules of engagement: no {{shooting}} unless we're shot at." [...] He added, [...] "In the military, it's like we're trained to hesitate now. If somebody had seen something wrong and shot, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been court-martialed". Petty Officer Jennifer Kudrick {{said that if the}} sentries had fired on the suicide craft [...] "we would have gotten in more trouble for shooting two foreigners than losing seventeen American sailors".|$|E
60|$|And the old {{man took}} up his little lute, or as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> called it, 'fidel,' and began {{chanting}} to his own accompaniment.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote N: Had he {{remained}} longer in Paris, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> fallen a victim, amongst the Brissotins, to the reactionary {{fury of the}} Jacobin party.--Ed.] ...|$|R
50|$|Fischer won the World Cup overall on two {{occasions}} (1996/97 and 1998/99), he's also come second twice (1993/94 and 2004/05), and third three times (1995/96, 1997/98, and 1999/2000). In the 2004/05 season Fischer lost the World Cup by only eleven points, which <b>he</b> most <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> earned <b>had</b> <b>he</b> competed in the final race of the year, but he missed it because of a cold.|$|R
2500|$|In Cerulean Sins Asher {{admits that}} if Jean-Claude {{had been with}} them, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been hurt like Asher. [...] Worse, {{there would be no}} one to save Asher so he would have shared Julianna's fate of death. Also in the series, and in French, Asher tells Jean-Claude that he chose Julianna as a human servant to secure Jean-Claude's love and companionship. Asher's servant was chosen to appeal to and keep Jean-Claude in Asher's life. Jean-Claude begged the High Council to save Asher in {{exchange}} for 100 years of servitude. Jean-Claude would rather Asher live and hate him than die. As Julianna burned, she screamed not for Asher, but for Jean-Claude to save her, up to the very last she believed he would rescue her.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some time}} in 138, Hadrian {{requested}} in the senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming quaestor before his twenty-fourth birthday. The senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, consul for 139. Marcus' adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. But for his adoption, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become triumvir monetalis, a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as tribune with a legion, becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: [...] "He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had {{when he was an}} ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Weeks,"Billy O'Sullivan's death {{might not}} have {{happened}} if he had listened to Jimmy. Billy O had been with Jimmy against the Mullins and had shot Buddy Roache during the gang war. Buddy, whose brother Mickey later became Boston's police commissioner, ended up crippled and in a wheelchair. In March 1971, not long after he shot the wrong McGonagle, Jimmy went to New York to pick up guns. Before he left, he told Billy to be careful while he was gone and not to drink. But that night, Billy hung around with Kevin O'Neil down at the Transit Cafe and ended up drunk. Kevin offered him a ride home, but Billy refused the offer. Heading home, He was chased {{by a couple of}} men with the Mullins gang who caught up with him when he tripped over a manhole cover about 200 yards from his house and fell down. While he was lying there, the pursuers shot him to death. If Kevin O'Neil had ended up driving [...] Billy O'Sullivan home that night, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been killed, too." ...|$|E

50|$|In Esquisse pour une autoanalyse, Pierre Bourdieu {{argues that}} the success of the concept of Oedipus is inseparable from the {{prestige}} associated with ancient Greek culture and the relations of domination that are reinforced in the use of this myth. In other words, if Oedipus was Bantu or Baoule, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> benefited from the coronation of universality. This remark recalls the historically and socially situated character of the founder of psychoanalysis.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the first}} day, the Allies {{probably}} sustained 2,000 casualties and the French somewhat fewer. Despite their vastly superior numbers, the Allies did not gain {{an inch of}} ground. If Napoleon had understood that he was facing an army several times larger than his own, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> retreated to the north bank of the Aube during the night. In fact, Czar Alexander feared that Napoleon would pull back to the north bank and lunge east, seizing the bridge at Lesmont in the Allied rear. However, Napoleon still suffered from the delusion that Schwarzenberg's army was in retreat while Wrede acted as rearguard. Though Schwarzenberg sent out his orders at 11:00 pm, the Crownprince's copy went astray and did not reach him until 5:00 am on 21 March. Therefore it took until 10:00 am for the Crownprince's three corps to deploy between Wrede's left flank and the Barbuise stream. The III Corps took post on Wrede's left, the IV Corps was next and the VI Corps was on the extreme left near Voué. Part of the III Corps {{had been left behind}} to hold Troyes.|$|E

60|$|This story {{should teach}} {{us to think}} quickly and clearly upon all occasions; for had Jane Gladys not remembered that she owned the bear <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> eaten her before the bell rang.|$|E
5000|$|Some of Oxford's lyric {{works have}} survived. Steven W. May, an {{authority}} on Oxford's poetry, attributes sixteen poems definitely, and four possibly, to Oxford noting that these are probably [...] "only a good sampling" [...] as [...] "both Webbe (1586) and Puttenham (1589) rank him first among the courtier poets, an eminence <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been granted, despite {{his reputation as a}} patron, by virtue of a mere handful of lyrics".|$|R
60|$|Ben {{tried to}} be grateful, but nothing short of Lita <b>would</b> <b>have</b> healed his wounded heart, {{and she was not}} Thorny's to give, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> offered her to his afflicted friend.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goble {{regarded}} the silver-tongued orator wrathfully. He was {{not accustomed to}} chatterboxes arguing with him like this. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> said something momentous and crushing, {{but at this point}} Jill intervened.|$|R
