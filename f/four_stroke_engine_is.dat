40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the kinematics formulation {{of an internal}} combustion engine crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> based on simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth rotary output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel. The cyclic operation leads to unequal gas forces, and the acceleration and deceleration of the reciprocating powe...|$|E

This is a copyright-cleared version of the Thesis. Despite challenges with poor emissions and fuel economy, gasoline two <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> continue to <b>be</b> developed {{for a number of}} applications. The primary reasons for the choice of a gasoline two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> includes its low cost, mechanical simplicity and high specific power output. Some applications for the gasoline two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> include small capacity motorcycles and scooters, off road recreational vehicles, hand held power tools and unmanned aerial vehicles. New technologies, which are already mature in <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engines,</b> <b>are</b> now being applied to two <b>stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> Such technologies include direct fuel injection, electronic engine management and exhaust gas after treatment. To implement these new technologies computation models are being continuously developed to improve the design process of engines. Multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling is now commonly applied to engine research and development, it is a powerful tool that can give great insight into the thermofluid working of an <b>engine.</b> Multi-dimensional tools <b>are</b> however computationally expensive and quasi-dimensional modelling methods are often better suited for the analysis of an engine, for example in transient engine simulation. This thesis reports {{the development of a new}} quasi-dimensional combustion model for a loop scavenged two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> The model differs from other quasi-dimensional models available in the literature as it accounts for a bulk motion of the flame front due to the tumble motion created by the loop scavenge process. In this study the tumble motion is modelled as an ellipsoid vortex and the size of the vortex is defined by the combustion chamber height and a limiting elliptical aspect ratio. The limiting aspect ratio has been observed in experimental square piston compression machines and optical engines. The new model also accounts for a wrinkled flame brush thickness and its effects on the interaction between flame front and combustion chamber. The new combustion model has been validated against experimental engine tests in which the flame front propagation was measured using ionization probes.

40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of trace elements in interfering matrices were developed. The methods involve two strategies for the reduction of interferences: the use of new pretreatment methods for use with existing instrumentation, {{and the development of}} new instrumentation. ^ A comparison was made of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection limits and interference reduction for arsenic by hydride generation, flow injection, continuous aspiration, and mixed gas methods. Practical considerations in implementing these common techniques, {{as well as in the}} general use and maintenance of an ELAN 5000 ICP-MS instrument are presented for the benefit of new users. ^ Two approaches for the elimination of interferences in {{the determination}} of arsenic in gold by ICP-MS. The main challenges in this analysis were the arsenic signal suppression by gold and the polyatomic interference due to chloride. A method was developed for the batch mode reductive precipitation removal of interfering gold matrix from the sample prior to hydride generation and detection of arsenic. This method has great potential value as the basis for other simple methods for the removal of transition metals that interfere with hydride generation. An on-line anion exchange method for the removal of interfering gold prior to hydride generation was subsequently developed to improve the speed of analysis. The batch-mode reduction method for the removal of gold resulted in a better detection limit than the anion exchange method. However, the automated anion exchange gold removal method required less bench chemistry, was faster, consumed less reagents, and created less mess than the off-line method. ^ On-line solid phase extraction methods are a valuable and increasingly popular method for the removal of matrix interferences. The automation of sample pretreatment as well as the small sample size required when the technique is combined with flow injection make it ideal for use in the analysis of hazardous materials. The severe signal suppression of uranium on lithium, beryllium, magnesium, and aluminum was overcome by the on-line flow injection-solid phase extraction removal of uranium using a column packed with Tru-Spec resin. The column was regenerated on-line using ammonium oxalate. ^ The development of an internal combustion engine as a novel source for atomic emission spectrometry was begun.
