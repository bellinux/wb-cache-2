5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the Palestinian {{refugees}} who fled or were expelled from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the <b>fedayeen</b> began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products they had lost {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an Palestinian state declared in October 1948, became the focal point of the Palestinian <b>fedayeen</b> activity. <b>Fedayeen</b> attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the <b>fedayeen</b> that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fedayeen</b> {{actions were}} cited by Israel {{as one of}} the reasons for its {{launching}} of the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the 1967 War, and the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon. Palestinian <b>fedayeen</b> groups were united under the umbrella the Palestine Liberation Organization after the defeat of the Arab armies in the 1967 Six-Day War, though each group retained its own leader and independent armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Commando Training: Finally, an {{even smaller}} group {{selected}} for specialised commando tactics training and marine navigation training {{given to the}} <b>Fedayeen</b> unit selected in order to target Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the <b>fedayeen)</b> within Jordan from other Arab countries. The <b>fedayeen</b> activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the <b>fedayeen</b> and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{became a}} refugee when {{his family was}} {{expelled}} from Ramla during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and began leading a minor <b>fedayeen</b> force in the Gaza Strip. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in Algeria. He {{played an important role}} in the 1970–71 Black September clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined the PLO in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|British {{journalist}} Alec Collett, who {{had been}} kidnapped in Beirut in March, was hanged after the airstrikes, reportedly by ANO operatives; his remains {{were found in the}} Beqaa Valley in November 2009. The bodies of two British teachers, Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield, and an American, Peter Kilburn, were found in a village near Beirut on 17 April 1986; the Arab <b>Fedayeen</b> Cells, a name linked to Abu Nidal, claimed responsibility. British journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped the same day.|$|E
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian <b>fedayeen</b> out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian <b>fedayeen,</b> Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E
5|$|Khalil al-Wazir {{was born}} in 1935 to Muslim parents {{in the city of}} Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were {{expelled}} in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of <b>fedayeen</b> to harass Israelis at military posts near the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (<b>fedayeen,</b> meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the <b>Fedayeen</b> Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
25|$|Many {{incidents}} of <b>Fedayeen</b> fighters using human shields were reported from various towns in Iraq. Iraqi Republican Guard units were also {{reported to be}} using human shields. Some reports indicate that the <b>Fedayeen</b> used ambulances to deliver messages and transport fighters into combat. On 31 March, <b>Fedayeen</b> in a Red Crescent-marked ambulance attacked American soldiers outside of Nasiriyah, wounding three. During the Battle of Basra, British forces of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) reported that on 28 March, <b>Fedayeen</b> forces opened fire on thousands of civilian refugees fleeing the city.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 11 British {{soldiers}} were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and <b>Fedayeen</b> were killed.|$|E
25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the <b>Fedayeen</b> drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the <b>Fedayeen,</b> under the weight of fire the <b>Fedayeen</b> retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the <b>Fedayeen</b> leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the <b>Fedayeen</b> vehicles, another <b>Fedayeen</b> convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling <b>Fedayeen,</b> eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 <b>Fedayeen</b> fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two <b>Fedayeen</b> armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 <b>Fedayeen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bravo company {{turned its}} {{attention}} to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team - Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 <b>Fedayeen</b> remained in the town; <b>Fedayeen</b> patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided in precision airstrikes on <b>Fedayeen</b> anti aircraft guns {{on the outskirts of}} the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of <b>Fedayeen</b> militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town an commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the <b>Fedayeen</b> blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies. ODA 521 and 525 continued to operate in the region, stopping several trucks carrying foreign fighters, they disarmed them, took their details and warned them not to come back before sending them to Syria; in late May, the teams were replaced by the 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Amarah: A {{roadside}} bomb killed one and wounded three others in Amarah. Gunmen also shot dead a suspected {{former member of}} the <b>Fedayeen</b> paramilitary.|$|E
25|$|After Jordan {{lost control}} of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters (<b>fedayeen,</b> meaning self-sacrificers) moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli {{occupied}} territories. One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle. It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO. After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp and sustaining relatively high casualties. The perceived joint Jordanian-Palestinian victory in the 1968 Battle of Karameh led to an upsurge of support in the Arab World for Palestinian fighters in Jordan. The PLO in Jordan grew in strength, and by the beginning of 1970 the <b>fedayeen</b> groups started to openly call for the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Acting as a state within a state, the <b>fedayeen</b> disregarded local laws and regulations, and even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice, leading to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian army. Hussein wanted to oust the <b>fedayeen</b> from the country, but hesitated to strike because {{he did not want to}} be seen as massacring the Palestinians. PLO actions in Jordan culminated in the Dawson's Field hijackings incident on 10September 1970, in which the <b>fedayeen</b> hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in Zarqa, taking foreign nationals as hostages, and later bombing the planes in front of the international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw, and ordered the army to move.|$|E
25|$|In the January 1955 {{elections}} Mapai won 40 {{seats and}} the Labour Party 10, Moshe Sharett became {{prime minister of}} Israel {{at the head of}} a left-wing coalition. Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab terrorism and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli counter-raids. Palestinian <b>fedayeen</b> attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from (Egyptian occupied) Gaza. <b>Fedayeen</b> attacks led to a growing cycle of violence as Israel launched reprisal attacks against Gaza. In 1954 the Uzi submachine gun first entered use by the Israel Defense Forces. In 1955 the Egyptian government began recruiting former Nazi rocket scientists for a missile program.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled Kirkuk after fierce {{fighting}} {{to capture the}} ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of Tuz had largely broken {{the will of the}} Iraqi Army and only the <b>Fedayeen</b> remained in Kirkuk, the first ODA units entered the city the next day, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city, after some minor skirmishes the <b>Fedayeen</b> fled. Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba'ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 March, the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, which was {{attached}} to Regimental Combat Team One (RCT-1), pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15kilometers (9.3miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from Kut launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi <b>Fedayeen</b> continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of <b>Fedayeen</b> were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fedayeen</b> Saddam militia, Republican Guard and Iraqi {{security}} forces {{were reported to}} have executed Iraqi soldiers who tried to surrender on multiple occasions, as well as threatening the families of those who refused to fight. One such incident was directly observed during the Battle of Debecka Pass.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} was overrun at 10:30 AM. The 19 Marine {{guards were}} armed only with pistols and shotguns. Embassy staff locked {{themselves in the}} communications vault and started to destroy documents. <b>Fedayeen</b> militants threatened to {{set fire to the}} place and kill them all, so Ambassador Sullivan ordered the surrender of the Embassy.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March, ODA 554 of Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion 5th SFG {{crossed the}} border with the United States Marines to support the seizure of the Rumaylah oilfields which was later secured by UK forces; half the team later drove to the {{outskirts}} of Basra and successfully picked up four Iraqi oil industry technicians who had been recruited by the CIA to assist in safeguarding the oilfields from destruction, they later rejoined {{the other half of the}} team and fought roving bands of <b>Fedayeen.</b> The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra. The ODA soon established an informant network, they eventually assisted the British in rounding up some 170 <b>Fedayeen</b> in the city; they were eventually replaced by members of G Squadron 22nd SAS Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Jordan {{allowed the}} <b>fedayeen</b> {{to leave for}} Lebanon through Syria, an event {{that led to the}} Lebanese Civil War in 1975. The Black September Organization was founded the same year, named after the conflict. The {{organization}} claimed responsibility for the assassination of Jordanian prime minister Wasfi Al-Tal in 1971, and the highly publicized 1972 Munich massacre against Israeli athletes.|$|E
25|$|From 1968 onwards, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) began {{conducting}} raids from Lebanon into Israel, and Israel {{began making}} retaliatory raids against Lebanese villages {{to encourage the}} Lebanese people to themselves deal with the <b>fedayeen.</b> After an Israeli airline was machine-gunned at Athens Airport, Israel raided the Beirut International Airport in retaliation, destroying 13 civilian aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During the invasion, foreign volunteers {{traveled}} to Iraq from Syria and {{took part in}} the fighting, usually under the command of the <b>Fedayeen</b> Saddam. It is not known for certain how many foreign fighters fought in Iraq in 2003, however, intelligence officers of the U.S. First Marine Division estimated that 50% of all Iraqi combatants in central Iraq were foreigners.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} in the Iraqi military before the war was uncertain, but it was {{believed to have been}} poorly equipped. The International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated the Iraqi armed forces to number 538,000 (Iraqi Army 375,000, Iraqi Navy 2,000, Iraqi Air Force 20,000 and air defense 17,000), the paramilitary <b>Fedayeen</b> Saddam 44,000, Republican Guard 80,000 and reserves 650,000.|$|E
25|$|This period saw {{the rise}} of Nasserism; the {{founding}} of the United Arab Republic in 1958 and its collapse in 1961; Syrian plans for the diversion of water from the Jordan River; continued <b>fedayeen</b> raids, mostly from Syria and Jordan, and Israeli reprisals; and the increasing alignment of the Arab states with the Soviet Union, who became their largest arms supplier.|$|E
25|$|The Dawson's Field hijackings were {{instrumental}} in provoking the Black September crackdown, which came close to destroying the PLO. The hijackings led King Hussein of Jordan {{to carry out a}} major offensive against militant strongholds in his kingdom resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. In autumn 1970, Habash visited Beijing. After Black September, the PLO <b>fedayeen</b> relocated to Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Its {{location}} was initially {{the main reason}} for its founding, as an Israeli civilian presence was important for cementing control of the area so as to prevent any future invasion from Egypt or its use as a staging area for <b>fedayeen</b> attacks, and indeed this rationale was echoed following the 1967 Six-Day War by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
25|$|By 15 June 1982, Israeli {{units were}} entrenched outside Beirut. The United States called for PLO {{withdrawal}} from Lebanon, and Sharon began to order bombing raids of West Beirut, targeting some 16,000 PLO <b>fedayeen</b> who had retreated into fortified positions. Meanwhile, Arafat attempted through negotiations to salvage politically what {{was clearly a}} disaster for the PLO, an attempt which eventually succeeded once the multinational force arrived to evacuate the PLO.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Simon Anglim, {{the rebel}} groups {{were divided into}} general categories: mujahadeen and <b>fedayeen.</b> The former were guerrillas who engaged in armed confrontations, while the latter committed acts of sabotage. According to later accounts of some surviving rebel leaders from the Galilee, the mujahideen maintained little coordination with the nominal hierarchy of the revolt. Most ambushes {{were the result of}} a local initiative undertaken by a qa'id or a group of quwwa'id from the same area.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks into}} the invasion, U.S.-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the {{defenders}} were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, <b>Fedayeen</b> Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.|$|E
25|$|The Gaza Strip {{was chosen}} as another {{military}} objective because Israel wished to remove the training grounds for <b>Fedayeen</b> groups, and because Israel recognised that Egypt could use the territory as a staging ground for attacks against the advancing Israeli troops. Israel advocated rapid advances, for which a potential Egyptian flanking attack would present {{even more of a}} risk. Arish and Abu Uwayulah were important hubs for soldiers, equipment, and centres of command and control of the Egyptian Army in the Sinai.|$|E
25|$|In late 1954, Nasser began {{a policy}} of {{sponsoring}} raids into Israel by the <b>fedayeen,</b> who almost always attacked civilians. The raids triggered a series of Israeli reprisal operations. The raids were targeted as much politically as against Israel militarily. It was Nasser's intention to win himself the laurels of the foremost anti-Zionist state {{as a way of}} establishing his leadership over the Arab world. Before 1954, the principal target of Nasser's speeches had been Britain. Only after the Anglo-Egyptian agreement on evacuating the Canal zone did Israel emerge as one of Nasser's main enemies.|$|E
25|$|He {{supported}} the Palestinians {{in their struggle}} against Israel for ideological reasons, but also to garner support from the Palestinian <b>fedayeen</b> based in Lebanon's refugee camps. The presence in Lebanon {{of large numbers of}} Palestinian refugees was resented by most Christians, but Jumblatt strived to build a hard core of opposition around the Arab nationalist slogans of the Palestinian movement. Demanding a new Lebanese order based on secularism, socialism, Arabism and an abolition of the sectarian system, Jumblatt began gathering disenchanted Sunnis, Shi'a and leftist Christians into an embryonic national opposition movement.|$|E
