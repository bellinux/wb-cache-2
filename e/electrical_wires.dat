5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately replicate {{the atmosphere of the}} Walled City is reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|In Southaven, 40homes were flooded and 200were left {{homeless}} as {{a result}} of the heavy rainfall. A church undergoing construction in Calhoun County was damaged, and a street light in Lee County was snapped. Also, a fallen tree damaged a house in Itawamba County. One indirect fatality occurred in Jasper County from an automobile accident due to wet roads. An estimated 24,000customers lost electric power during the storm. After the storm, several fires were sparked due to downed <b>electrical</b> <b>wires.</b> In all, the weakening Hurricane Dennis left $2.6million (2005USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
2500|$|Copper is the {{electrical}} conductor in many categories of <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring.</b> Copper wire {{is used in}} power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Copper and its alloys are also used to make electrical contacts. [...] <b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> in buildings {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. Roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> and cable conductors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wire</b> {{guidance}} {{dates back}} to the 19th cenutury with some early examples being the Brennan torpedo and Lay Torpedo. A prototype ground based <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> guided torpedo was built by the Germans during World War II.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> {{practices}} {{developed in}} parallel {{in many countries}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see National <b>Electrical</b> Code, <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> in the United Kingdom). Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends {{not only on the}} wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.|$|R
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker, {{a college student}} (and his son's classmate). While Parker is going about his civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks him out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking him to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became Green Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> wiping out his memory. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (and by extension, Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Green Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Green Goblin.|$|E
5|$|One {{person was}} struck and injured by an uprooted tree at Atherton, which {{suffered}} {{the loss of}} one house. All residences in Cardwell endured some degree of damage, with six unroofed, and the town itself was without power. Roads in Charters Towers were obstructed, and minor damage was observed at Cowley Beach, Dunk Island, and East Russell. Nearly all buildings in El Arish were damaged, and at Gordonvale, flooding inflicted widespread crop damage and winds toppled trees and power lines. Flood waters cut off the town of Halifax and inundated local businesses. Although no structural damage was recorded in Herberton, the cyclone uprooted trees, crippled Archer Bridge above Kennedy Creek, and halted electrical and telephone service. Mena Creek was completely cut off, and at Malanda, 30homes experienced damage and 20farms were wrecked. At Millaa Millaa, the cyclone damaged 12dwellings, and hundreds of barns, also impeding access to power and water supplies. Meanwhile, at Miriwinni, winds damaged 50houses, toppled <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> and strewed roads with debris. Despite the fact that flooding was less serious at Kurrimine Beach, the storm still damaged dozens of houses and toppled electrical poles, with the towns of Ravenshoe and Silkwood experiencing power outages following the disturbance's passage. Although only inconsequential residential damage occurred at Woopen Creek and Yungaburra, damage at Tully was more serious, with considerable flooding, destruction to six houses, damage to a police station, and a localized blackout.|$|E

25|$|No {{distress}} call was {{received from the}} aircraft. Initial speculation that the aircraft went down after hitting <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> was quickly eliminated as a cause. Examination of the maintenance and flight department records revealed no unresolved maintenance discrepancies against the helicopter prior to departure. The helicopter was built in 1987 and refurbished in May 2004, and had no previous accident history.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{corrosion}} {{the fuel}} {{system must be}} made of suitable materials, <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{theater was}} used again once for a Wolfgang concert in 2011. But since 2012, the theater was closed again due to decays inside the building. The {{structure}} continued to deteriorate and vandalism, political advertisements, promotional materials and trash now degrade the heritage theater. The theater has been protected using pieces of wood, scrap <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> and rundown plywood. Help continued to pour in but lacked any concrete direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle for}} Vientiane began at 1320 hours on 13 December 1960 as Phoumi's forces attacked. The {{following}} four days' fighting would severely damage Vientiane. The central district {{was left in}} ruins; fallen trees and loose <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> littered the streets. The devastated city had suffered at least 600 houses destroyed, about {{an equal number of}} citizens killed, and 7,000 were left homeless. Military casualties were minor. One source reported paratrooper casualties as three killed, ten wounded; another gives a figure of 17 killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day's fighting would severely damage Vientiane. PAVN shelling in {{the morning}} of 14 December pushed Kouprasith's troops back into Camp Chinamiao, where Kouprasith languished in a sickbed. With PAVN artillery support, Phoumi's troops forced Kong Le's troops to the western and northern fringes of the city. By 15:00, the central district was in ruins; fallen trees and loose <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> littered the street. The National Treasury had been looted and burned. The post office and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's office were flattened. Wattay Airbase fell under Phoumi's control, and the Soviet military aid airlifts to Kong Le's forces halted.|$|E
25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
