5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{psychology}} researchers consider {{meaning in}} {{life as a}} subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life. Wong has proposed that whether life <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal striving and life as a whole <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> according to some objective normative standard.|$|E

25|$|Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) {{and similar}} methods take {{advantage}} of this kind of logic but uses more sophisticated statistics, because component genes in real processes display more complex behavior than simply moving up or down as a group, and the amount the genes move up and down <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> not just the direction. In any case, these statistics measure how different the behavior of some small set of genes is compared to genes not in that small set.|$|E

In order to ensure that the First Foundation would be created, Seldon and the Psychohistorians of Trantor placed the Commissioner Linge Chen (then actual if not crowned Emperor) under intense scrutiny, as well as Mentalic influence in order to achieve their aims.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{has been carried out}} for determining the association of Social Support and Self-Efficacy with Academic Achievement and School Satisfaction among female junior high school students in Birjand. For this purpose, 240 students were selected from 10 schools using the Multi-Stage Sampling Method. The results revealed that two components, i. e. “Self-Regulation” and “Test Taking”, <b>are</b> <b>meaningful</b> predictors for Academic Achievement, where as the component, “Reading” and Social Support <b>are</b> not <b>meaningful</b> predictors for the same. Moreover, the same two components of “Self-Regulation” and “Test Taking” along with the component “Teacher” are seen to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> predictors for School Satisfaction...|$|R
25|$|The Standard Penetration Test recovers {{a highly}} {{disturbed}} sample, {{which is generally}} not suitable for tests which measure properties of the in-situ soil structure, such as density, strength, and consolidation characteristics. To overcome this limitation, the test is often run with a larger sampler with a slightly different tip shape, so the disturbance of the sample is minimized, and testing of structural properties <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> for all but soft soils. However, this results in blow counts which are not easily converted to SPT N-values – many conversions have been proposed, some of which depend {{on the type of}} soil sampled, making reliance on blow counts with non-standard samplers problematic.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
25|$|Meaning and truth. The most {{important}} and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (lexis), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> utterance. The most original part of their theory {{is the idea that}} what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word Dion, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.|$|E

25|$|The results {{indicated}} that when the decision <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The {{results indicated}} a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E
25|$|By {{virtue of}} his belief that human history and {{collective}} praxis determine whether any philosophical question <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by Engels and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in God. Gramsci defined objectivity {{in terms of a}} universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could not be said to oppose religious dogma and superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.|$|E
25|$|Another {{opinion is}} that Homer was heir to an {{unbroken}} tradition of oral epic poetry reaching back some 500 years into Mycenaean times. The case is set out in The Singer of Tales by Albert B. Lord, citing earlier work by folklorist and mythographer Milman Parry. In this view, the poem's core could represent a historical campaign that {{took place at the}} eve of the decline of the Mycenaean civilization. Much legendary material would have been added during this time, but in this view it <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> to ask for archaeological and textual evidence corresponding to events referred to in the Iliad. Such a historical background gives a credible explanation for the geographical knowledge of Troy (which could, however, also have been obtained in Homer's time by visiting the traditional site of the city, which was in fact New Ilium, built {{at the base of the}} hill at Hisarlık) and otherwise unmotivated elements in the poem (in particular the detailed Catalogue of Ships). Linguistically, a few verses of the Iliad suggest great antiquity, because they only fit the meter if projected back into Mycenaean Greek, in part due to the classical loss of the digamma; this trace of archaic language suggests a poetic tradition spanning the Greek Dark Ages. On the other hand, there are well-known interpolations in the text we have. Even though Homer was Ionian, the Iliad reflects the geography known to the Mycenaean Greeks, showing detailed knowledge of the mainland but not extending to the Ionian Islands or Anatolia, which suggests that the Iliad reproduces an account of events handed down by tradition, to which the author did not add his own geographical knowledge.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher R. M. Hare told a parable {{in an attempt}} to demonstrate that religious language <b>is</b> <b>meaningful.</b> Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a [...] "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people– religious and non-religious– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by empirical evidence. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world. Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.|$|E

In 1988, the newspaper Nieuwsblad van het Noorden called the museum [...] "charming" [...] and wrote: [...] "A museum like De Oude Wolden <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> because of its rather complete documentation of everyday life in the 19th and early 20th century." ...|$|E
