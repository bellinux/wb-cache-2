5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

Cationic starch (CS) has been tested as an effective soil modifier, but {{little is known about}} its potential impacts on the treated water. This study investigated <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> in the bloom water after algal removal using cationic starch modified soils (CS-MSs). Results showed that the <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> carbon (DOC) could be decreased by CS-MS flocculation and the use of higher charge density CS yielded a greater DOC reduction. When CS with the charge density of 0. 052, 0. 102 and 0. 293 meq/g were used, DOC was decreased from 3. 4 to 3. 0, 2. 3 and 1. 7 mg/L, respectively. The excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and UV 254 analysis indicated that CS-MS exhibits an ability to remove some soluble organics, which contributed to the DOC reduction. However, the use of low charge density CS posed a potential risk of DOC increase due to the high CS loading for effective algal removal. When CS with the charge density of 0. 044 meq/g was used, DOC was increased from 3. 4 to 3. 9 mg/L. This study suggested, when CS-MS is used for cyanobacterial bloom removal, the content of <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> in the treated water can be controlled by optimizing the charge density of CS.

2500|$|The {{reduction}} {{product of}} superoxide is hydrogen peroxide, {{one of the}} most studied reactive oxygen species because it occurs in relatively high concentrations, is relatively stable, and is fairly easy to measure. [...] It is thought that algal photosynthesis {{is one of the major}} modes of hydrogen peroxide production, while the production of H2O2 by stressed organisms is a secondary source. In marine systems, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exists at concentrations of 10−8-10−9 M in the photic zone, but has been found in double those concentrations in parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Its lifetime, ranging from hours to days in coastal waters, can be as long as 15 days in Antarctic seawater. [...] H2O2 is important in aquatic environments because it can oxidize <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and affect the redox chemistry of iron, copper, and manganese. [...] Since hydrogen peroxide, as an uncharged molecule, diffuses easily across biological membranes it can directly damage cellular constituents (DNA and enzymes) by reacting with them and deactivating their functions.

2500|$|According to Blough & Zepp, {{superoxide}} {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10−12 M in the open ocean and up to 2×10−10M in coastal areas. [...] The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water. In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds. [...] Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide. [...] At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×104 – 4.5×105 L mol−1sec−1 in seawater. [...] The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase with a rate constant on the order of 2×109 L mol−1sec−1. As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species. As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron. This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient. [...] As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane. [...] Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions. [...] Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320nm.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrom top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, {{atmospheric}} correction for ocean color inversion aims at distinguishing atmosphere and water contributions. From a methodological point of view, our approach {{relies on a}} Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate <b>matters</b> and colored <b>dissolved</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and pre-estimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations. We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (C 2 R).
