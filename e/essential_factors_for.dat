The Linux kernel's architecture was required to support many independent volunteer developers, which suggested that the system portions that require the most developmenthardware device drivers, file systems and network protocolsbe implemented in an extensible fashion. The Linux kernel's architecture chose to make these systems extensible using a data abstraction technique each hardware device driver is implemented as a separate module that supports a common interface. In this way, a single developer can add a new device driver, with minimal interaction required with other developers of the Linux kernel.|$|E

40|$|Argonaute {{proteins}} {{function in}} gene silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in various organisms. In Drosophila, the Argonaute proteins AGO 1 and AGO 2 have {{been implicated in}} post-transcriptional gene-silencing (PTGS) /RNA interference (RNAi). In this study, we found that AGO 1 and AGO 2 depletion caused the accumulation of multicopied enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) transgene transcripts in Drosophila S 2 cells. Depletion of AGO 1, the <b>essential</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> miRNA biogenesis, led to an increased transcriptional rate of the transgenes. In contrast, depletion of AGO 2, the <b>essential</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> siRNA-directed RNAi, resulted in EGFP mRNA stabilization with concomitant shortening of the EGFP mRNA poly(A) tail. Our findings suggest that AGO 1 and AGO 2 mediate multicopied transgene silencing by different mechanisms. Intriguingly, Dicer 2 depletion phenocopies AGO 2 depletion, {{with an increase in}} EGFP protein levels and shortening of the EGFP mRNA poly(A) tail. The possibility that AGO 2 and Dicer 2 involve, at least in part, poly(A) length maintenance of transgene mRNA suggests a potentially important link between transgene silencing and poly(A) tails...|$|R
