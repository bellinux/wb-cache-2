40|$|<b>Earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami {{simulation}} is {{one example}} of advanced computer technology for predicting and visualizing structural damage of all buildings in a target area. With structural analysis results, <b>earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami simulation can provide reliable output of structural damage in selected earthquake scenarios. Applying a set of such reliable output to disaster management, prevention measures can be constructed to protect human life and property in the earthquake scenarios. This paper proposes practical applications of <b>earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami simulation output in disaster management point of view. In <b>earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami simulation output, each individual building is considered separately as micro output, and all buildings of the target area are considered simultaneously as macro output. Based on the micro output, a strengthening plan for existing buildings and a construction guideline for new buildings can be developed from predicted structural damage of each individual building. Based on the macro output, visualization of <b>earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami simulation output can classify the range of building damage and indicate a weak point of the target area in order to control overall damage and increase people’s awareness. In the future, integrated <b>earthquake</b> <b>and</b> tsunami simulation with evacuation models will help for better evaluation of the present evacuation methods, routes, and shelters...|$|R

It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.

5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need to upgrade and {{renovate}} City Hall began anew in 1988. In 1994, proposals were made to remodel and update the structure to meet modern building codes, with an estimated cost of $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for <b>earthquakes</b> <b>and</b> fires.|$|E

5|$|In September 1985, as <b>earthquakes</b> <b>and</b> phreatic eruptions {{rocked the}} area, local {{officials}} began planning for an evacuation.

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{occurs in}} about 26,000 {{people a year}} in the United States.

Manila has endured several deadly earthquakes, notably in 1645 and in 1677 which destroyed the stone and brick medieval city.

5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby <b>earthquakes</b> <b>and</b> seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjunction}} of several planets which Brad Dourif's character Dennis Hoffman speaks about was reliably predicted {{at the time}} of the episode's broadcast. The effects of such an alignment had been debated for some time, with studies both linking conjunction to several major <b>earthquakes</b> <b>and</b> debunking the theory entirely. Several similar alignments have occurred in the past without resulting in any additional natural activity on Earth. The predicted conjunction did occur in May 2000, with no consequence on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large <b>earthquakes</b> <b>and</b> volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E
