40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the cellular biochemical and experimental therapeutic effects of L-glutamine (<b>gin)</b> <b>and</b> L-asparagine (asn) depletion for paediatric sarcoma cells. The work presented in this thesis describes preclinical studies designed to examine the effect of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn deprivation on cell survival and cellular metabolism, in rhabdomyosarcoma (A 204), osteogenic sarcoma (HOS) and Ewing's sarcoma (TC 32) cells. The influence of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn deprivation on the chemosensitivity of drugs employed in treatment protocols currently utilised for these cancer types has also been investigated. The results presented show that removal of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn both independently and simultaneously can be growth inhibitory, affecting both cell viability and the induction of apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Surprisingly, little impact on the cell cycle was observed. Overall, gin deprivation was more detrimental to cell growth and survival than asn deprivation with an additive effect being observed following combined <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn deprivation. The effect of reducing <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn on <b>gin</b> synthetase (GS) <b>and</b> asn synthetase (AS) mRNA expression levels and intracellular concentrations of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn showed that effects were cell line dependant. <b>Gin</b> <b>and</b> asn deprivation not only affected the rate of lactate production generated by suspected Warburg metabolism, but also decreased total glutathione levels which is indicative of alterations in the redox control of these cells. Reduction of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn gave rise to chemo-potentiative effects in all cells following treatment with doxorubicin (DOX), vincristine (VCR), temozolomide (TMZ), topotecan (TOPO) and cisplatin (CDDP). Most notably, a 70 -fold chemopotentiation of TOPO was observed in A 204 cells following combined <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> asn deprivation. The only exception was methotrexate (MTX) treatment of HOS cells where a chemo-protective effect was observed. Results such as this may give insights into new chemotherapeutic regimens that could be developed in order to treat these cancers...|$|R
