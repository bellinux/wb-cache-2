Hemagglutinating antibodies to the fraction 1 antigen were not stimulated by doses lower than 10 (4) viable organisms.

All Praomys vaccinated with a dose of 10 (6) agar-grown EV 76 - 51 <b>f</b> <b>protected</b> against a virulent challenge, whereas even doses up to 10 (8) lyophilized bacilli failed to give complete protection. The pathogenicity of a live attenuated plague vaccine derived from the Y. pestis EV 76 vaccine strain can be detected in Praomys (Mastomys) natalensis, a rodent species highly susceptible to plague.

The pathogenesis of COPD involves oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Various natural marine compounds possess both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but few have been tested for their efficacy in COPD models. In this study, we conducted an in vitro screening test to identify natural compounds isolated from various brown algae species that might provide protection against cigarette smoke extract (CSE) -induced cytotoxicity. Among nine selected natural compounds, apo- 9 ′-fucoxanthinone (Apo 9 F) exhibited the highest protection against CSE-induced cytotoxicity in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC 2). Furthermore, the protective effects of Apo 9 F were observed to be associated with a significant reduction in apoptotic cell death, DNA damage, and the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from CSE-exposed HBEC 2 cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunization with {{recombinant}} carboxyl-terminal {{domain of}} the heavy chain (Hc domain) of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) stimulates protective immunity against native BoNT challenge. Most studies developing a botulism vaccine {{have focused on the}} whole Hc; however, since the principal protective epitopes are located within beta-trefoil domain (Hcbetatre), we hypothesize that immunization with the Hcbetatre domain is sufficient to confer protective immunity. In addition, enhancing its uptake subsequent to nasal delivery prompted development of an alternative vaccine strategy, and we hypothesize that the addition of targeting moiety adenovirus 2 fiber protein (Ad 2 F) may enhance such uptake during vaccination. RESULTS: The Hcbetatre serotype B immunogen was genetically fused to Ad 2 F (Hcbetatre/B-Ad 2 F), and its immunogenicity was tested in mice. In combination with the mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin (CT), enhanced mucosal IgA and serum IgG Ab titers were induced by nasal Hcbetatre-Ad 2 F relative to Hcbetatre alone; however, similar Ab titers were obtained upon intramuscular immunization. These BoNT/B-specific Abs induced by nasal immunization were generally supported in large part by Th 2 cells, as opposed to Hcbetatre-immunized mice that showed more mixed Th 1 and Th 2 cells. Using a mouse neutralization assay, sera from animals immunized with Hcbetatre and Hcbetatre-Ad 2 <b>F</b> <b>protected</b> mice against 2. 0 LD 50. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Hcbetatre-based immunogens are highly immunogenic, especially when genetically fused to Ad 2 F, and Ad 2 F can be exploited as a vaccine delivery platform to the mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Microbiology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Multidrug {{resistant}} {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus is presenting an increasing threat, especially immune compromised individuals. Many of these strains have developed resistance to newly approved {{drugs such as}} quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid and daptomycin. The search for alternative treatment, including bacteriocins (ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides) of lactic acid bacteria is increasing. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis F 10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produced a new nisin variant active against clinical strains of S. aureus. The operon encoding nisin F is located on a plasmid and the structural gene has been sequenced. The lantibiotic {{is closely related to}} nisin Z, except at position 30 where valine replaced isoleucine. The antimicrobial activity of nisin F against S. aureus was tested in the respiratory tract of Wistar rats. Non-immunosuppressed and immunosuppressed rats were intranasally infected with S. aureus K and then treated with either nisin F or sterile physiological saline. Nisin <b>F</b> <b>protected</b> immunosuppressed rats against S. aureus, as symptoms of an infection were only detected in the trachea and lungs of immunosuppressed rats treated with saline. The safety of intranasally administered nisin F was also evaluated and proved to have no adverse side effects. The potential of nisin F as an antimicrobial agent to treat subcutaneous skin infections was evaluated by infecting C 57 BL/ 6 mice with a bioluminescent strain of S. aureus (Xen 36). Immunosuppressed mice were treated with either nisin F or sterile physiological saline 24 h and 48 h after infection with subcutaneously injected S. aureus Xen 36. Histology and bioluminescence flux measurements revealed that nisin F was ineffective in the treatment of deep dermal staphylococcal infections. Non-infected and infected mice treated with nisin F had an influx of polymorphonuclear cells in the deep stroma of the skin tissue. This suggested that nisin F, when injected subcutaneously, may have modulated the immune system. Nisin F proved an effective antimicrobial agent against S. aureus-related infections in the respiratory tract, but not against subcutaneous infections. The outcome of nisin F treatment thus depends on the route of administration and site of infection...|$|E

In order to characterize other possible structures of vWF involved in its capacity to bind and to <b>protect</b> <b>F.</b> VIII against human activated protein C (APC), we used a series of purified vWF fragments overlapping the whole sequence of the subunit. Among those were fragments SpIII (dimer; AA 1 - 1365), SpII (dimer; AA 1366 - 2050) and SpI (monomer; AA 911 - 1365) generated by Staphylococcus aureus V 8 proteinase, a P 34 species (monomer; AA 1 - 272) obtained with plasmin, a monomeric 39 / 34 kDa dispase fragment (AA 480 - 718) and a tetrameric III-T 2 fragment (AA 273 - 511 / 674 - 728) produced from SpIII by trypsin. Three other fragments without precise extremities were located using selected monoclonal antibodies to vWF. Two C-terminal fragments of 270 and 260 kDa, overlapping SpI and SpII, were respectively generated from vWF with trypsin and protease 1 from Crotalus atrox venom. An N-terminal 120 kDa fragment, overlapping P 34 and 39 / 34 kDa fragments, was produced by protease 1. Our results show that vWF bound to <b>F.</b> VIII and <b>protected</b> it from degradation by APC in a dose-dependent way. Among the C-terminal and central vWF fragments (SpII, tryptic 270 kDa, 260 kDa, SpI, 39 / 34 kDa and III-T 2), none {{had the capacity to}} bind or to <b>protect</b> <b>F.</b> VIII, even at high concentrations. The three N-terminal fragments (SpIII, 120 kDa and P 34) bound to F. VIII in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion.

In contrast, the P 34 species did not significantly <b>protect</b> <b>F.</b> VIII, even when using high concentrations of the fragment. In conclusion, the N-terminal end of vWF subunit (AA 1 - 272) plays a crucial role in binding to F. VIII, but requires additional structures of the 120 kDa fragment to protect it against APC. In addition, the presence of a secondary binding and/or protecting domain on other portions of the vWF subunit (potentially destroyed during the proteolysis of vWF) is highly unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{shed light on}} the ligand-dependent transactivation {{mechanisms}} of nuclear receptors (NRs). When the ligand dose is reduced, the transcriptional activity of NRs should be downregulated.

ERβ shows estrogen-dependent proteolysis, and its degradation is regulated by two regions in the receptor. The N-terminal 37 -amino acid-region is necessary for the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase, i. e., the carboxyl terminus of HSC 70 -interacting protein (CHIP), to degrade ERβ. In contrast, the C-terminal <b>F</b> domain <b>protects</b> ligand-unbound ERβ from proteolysis to abrogate proteasome association. Suppression of CHIP by interfering RNA inhibited this switching off of receptor-mediated transcription when the ligand dose was reduced.

On day 15, DNA damage was induced by intra-peritoneal (i. p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) (i. p.) at 50 mg/kg b. w. after the MN test and comet assay were performed. A protective effect of ethanolic extract was observed in MN test (6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/kg b. w.) and the comet assay (3. 13 and 6. 25, 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg b. w.). Caseargrewiin F showed protective effect at 0. 63, 1. 3 and 2. 5 mg/kg b. w. only in comet assay. We also tested the ability of compounds of C. sylvestris to induce MN and to increase the comet assay tail moment.

Examines: (1) the different elements of the four offences; (2) the meaning of "sexual"; (3) the issue of consent {{in the context of}} the Home Office report, Setting the Boundaries: Reforming the Law on Sex Offences of 2000, the White Paper 0 <b>f</b> 2002, <b>Protecting</b> the Public, and the Sexual Offences Bill 2003, the final provisions themselves as contained in ss. 74 - 76 and criticisms of them; (4) the significant change to the mens rea of rape and the sexual assault offences with the introduction of the "absence of reasonable belief in consent" test; (5) the placing of an evidential burden of proof on the defence; and (6) consent and the treatment of deception and threats...|$|R
40|$|A mixed {{infection}} of Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium necrophorum was resistant to treatment with penicillin {{even though a}} pure F. necrophorum infection could be successfully treated with penicillin. Since B. fragilis alone did not produce infection, {{these results indicate that}} B. fragilis can <b>protect</b> <b>F.</b> necrophorum from penicillin in vivo. The extent of protection afforded by a strain of B. fragilis was related to its level of resistance to penicillin. Only a few cells of B. fragilis were required in the initial bacterial injection. Moreover, protection was demonstrated when B. fragilis cells were injected as late as 24 h after the F. necrophorum cells. Protection of F. necrophorum from penicillin by B. fragilis was also demonstrated in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Immune-stimulating {{complexes}} (iscoms), {{which have}} recently {{been shown to be}} highly effective for the antigenic presentation of membrane proteins of viruses, were prepared with affinity-purified fusion (F) protein of measles virus (MV), using an adaptation of the standard method for iscom preparation. Immunization of monkeys with the F iscom preparation induced biologically active anti-F protein antibodies as was shown in haemolysis inhibition and cell-cell fusion inhibition tests. A whole MV iscom preparation, which also contained the haemagglutinin protein, induced not only haemolysis-inhibiting antibodies, but, in contrast to the F iscom preparation, also haemagglutination-inhibiting and virus-neutralizing antibodies. In addition the F iscom preparation was shown to activate measles virus-specific T cells in mice. This was demonstrated by the generation of an MV-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response in F iscom-immunized animals and by the isolation of T cell clones specific for MV F protein with the T helper phenotype. Vaccination of mice with MV iscom or <b>F</b> iscom <b>protected</b> them from MV-induced fatal encephalopathy. The data concerning the immunogenicity of MV proteins presented in iscoms are discussed in relation to their potential for the development of an inactivated measles vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{significant}} health problem {{for most of the}} world’s populations, and prevalence among indigenous groups is typically higher than among their nonindigenous neighbors. Native South Americans experience high rates of TB, but while research in several other world populations indicates that susceptibility is multifactorial, polygenic, and population-specific, little work has been undertaken to investigate factors involved in Native American susceptibility. We conducted a family-based association study to examine immunologically relevant polymorphisms of a candidate gene, the vitamin D receptor, in conjunction with three measures of TB status in two Native Paraguayan populations, the Aché and the Avá. This is the first large-scale genetic analysis of Native South Americans to examine susceptibility to both infection and disease following exposure to M. tuberculosis. These two types of susceptibility reflect differences in innate and acquired immunity that have proven difficult to elucidate in other populations. Our results indicate that among the Aché, the FokI <b>F</b> allele <b>protects</b> individuals from infection, while the TaqI t allele protects against active disease but not infection. In particular, FF homozygotes are 17 times more likely to test positive for exposure to TB, but no more likely to have ever been diagnose...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, has {{sponsored}} {{the development of}} a Fluidized Bed Waste Heat Recovery System (FBWHRS) and a higher temperature variant, the Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP) Fluidized Bed Heat Exchanger (FBHX) system. Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?<b>F</b> to <b>protect</b> the fluidized bed distributor plate. In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic distributor plate with a Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods. The ceramic unit permitted energy from flue gases to be recovered without diluting gases. Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages. The fluidized bed particles enhance heat transfer and continually clean the finned tubes in the fluidized beds. Also, only the distributor plate is exposed to the hot fouling and corrosive flue gases since the fluidized bed quickly cools these gases to a uniform 500 ?F...|$|R
