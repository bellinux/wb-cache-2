40|$|A low jitter optical pulse {{source for}} {{applications}} including optical sampling and optical metrology was modelled and then experimentally implemented using photonic components. Dispersion and non-linear fibre effects were utilised to compress a periodic optical waveform to generate pulses {{of the order}} of 10 picoseconds duration, via soliton-effect compression. Attractive features of this pulse source include electronically tuneable repetition rates greater than 1. 5 GHz, ultra-short pulse duration (10 - 15 ps), and low timing jitter as measured by both harmonic analysis and single-sideband (SSB) phase noise measurements. The experimental implementation of the modelled compression scheme is discussed, including the successful removal of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) through linewidth broadening by injection dithering or phase modulation. Timing jitter analysis identifies many unwanted artefacts generated by the SBS suppression methods, hence an experimental arrangement is devised (and was subsequently patented) which ensures that there are no phase modulation spikes present on the SSB phase noise spectrum over the offset range of interest for optical sampling applications, 10 Hz-Nyquist. It is believed {{that this is the first}} detailed timing jitter study of a soliton-effect compression scheme. The soliton-effect compression pulses are then used to perform what is believed to be the first demonstration of optical sampling using this type of pulse source. The pulse source was also optimised for use in a novel optical metrology (range finding) system, which is being developed and patented under European Space Agency funding as an enabling technology for formation flying satellite missions. This new approach to optical metrology, known as Scanning Interferometric Pulse Overlap Detection (SIPOD), is based on scanning the optical pulse repetition rate to find the specific frequencies which allow the return pulses from the outlying satellite, i. e. the measurement arm, to overlap exactly with a reference pulse set on the hub satellite. By superimposing a low frequency phase modulation onto the optical pulse train, it is possible to detect the pulse overlap condition using conventional heterodyne detection. By rapidly scanning the pulse repetition rate to find two frequencies which provide the overlapping pulse condition, high precision optical pulses can be used to provide high resolution unambiguous range information, using only relatively simple electronic detection circuitry. SIPOD’s maximum longitudinal range measurement is limited only by the coherence length of the laser, which can be many tens of kilometres. Range measurements have been made to better than 10 microns resolution over extended duration trial periods, at measurement update rates of up to 470 Hz. This system is currently scheduled to fly on ESA’s PROBA- 3 mission in 2012 to measure the <b>intersatellite</b> <b>spacing</b> for a two satellite coronagraph instrument. In summary, this thesis is believed to present three novel areas of research: the first detailed jitter characterisation of a soliton-effect compression source, the first optical sampling using such a compression source, and a novel optical metrology range finding system, known as SIPOD, which utilises the tuneable repetition rate and highly stable nature of the compression source pulses. ...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength {{division}} multiplexing (WDM) {{has been}} proposed for fibre, <b>intersatellite,</b> free <b>space</b> and indoor optical communication systems. Digital pulse position modulation (DPPM) is a more power efficient modulation format than on-off keying (OOK) and a strong contender for the modulation of free-space systems. Although DPPM obtains this advantage {{in exchange for a}} bandwidth expansion, WDM systems using it are still potentially attractive, particularly for moderate coding levels. However, WDM systems are susceptible to interchannel crosstalk and modelling this in a WDM DPPM system is necessary. Models of varying complexity, based on simplifying assumptions, are presented and evaluated for the case of a single crosstalk wavelength. For a single crosstalk, results can be straightforwardly obtained by artificially imposing the computationally convenient constraint that frames (and thus slots also) align. Multiple crosstalk effects are additionally investigated, for the most practically relevant cases of modest coding level, and using both simulation and analytical methods. In general, DPPM maintains its sensitivity advantage over OOK even in the presence of crosstalk while predicting lower power penalty at low coding level in WDM systems...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{pointing}} and tracking is one important characteristic of deep <b>space</b> <b>intersatellite</b> laser communication, {{so that the}} dynamic mathematical model is complicated nonlinearity and coupling. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to substitute the time-domain error transfer function of state equations and to linearize the state space for the sake of physical realization easily in terms of previous authors' work. The method applied is state feedback and coordinate transformation in nonlinear field, the calculated result is demonstrated that differential equations modeled can be transferred into canonical controllable form and realized physically. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} optical {{wireless}} communications (OWC), an emerging technology with huge {{potential for the}} provision of pervasive and reliable next-generation communications networks. It shows how the development of novel and efficient wireless technologies can contribute to a range of transmission links essential for the heterogeneous networks of the future to support various communications services and traffic patterns with ever-increasing demands for higher data-transfer rates. The book starts with a chapter reviewing the OWC field, which explains different sub-technologies (visible-light, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) communications) and introduces the spectrum of application areas (indoor, vehicular, terrestrial, underwater, <b>intersatellite,</b> deep <b>space,</b> etc.). This provides readers with the necessary background information to understand the specialist material in {{the main body of the}} book, which is in four parts. The first of these deals with propagation modelling and channel characterization of OWC channels at different spectral bands and with different applications. The second starts by providing a unified information-theoretic treatment of OWC and then discusses advanced physical-layer methodologies (including, but not limited to: advanced coding, modulation diversity, cooperation and multi-carrier techniques) and the ultimate limitations imposed by practical constraints. On top of the physical layer come the upper-layer protocols and cross-layer designs that are the subject of the third part of the book. The last part of the book features a chapter-by-chapter assessment of selected OWC applications. Optical Wireless Communications is a valuable reference guide for academic researchers and practitioners concerned with the future development of the world’s communication networks. It succinctly but comprehensively presents the latest advances in the field...|$|R
