30|$|The {{interaction}} processes {{depend on}} the scale size of the body, {{the presence or absence}} of an ionosphere and the electric conductivity of the surface of the body.

50|$|A typical {{electronic}} {{flash unit}} has electronic circuitry to charge a high-capacity capacitor to several hundred volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a flash tube, producing a flash of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the flash duration, often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of <b>full</b> <b>flash</b> brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach <b>full</b> brightness; electronic <b>flash</b> does not have these difficulties.|$|R

The crustal magnetic fields and {{the solar wind}} protons reflected by the lunar surface (Saito et al., 2008) give rise to a variety of interesting phenomena, but in this paper we limit ourselves to the basic cases of a non-magnetized body immersed in the solar wind having an intrinsic velocity distribution.|$|R

Another design feature is the built-in flash which has a two-position operation: the first push of the open button puts the flash pointing 45 degrees up to provide bounce flash, a feature that was mentioned in The New York Times in an article on brilliant ideas, and a second push of the button has the flash point directly away from the camera for <b>full</b> <b>flash</b> effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} {{power absorption}} in low pressure plasmas is investigated {{by means of}} an analyical model which couples Boltzmann's equation and the quasi-stationary Maxwell's equation. Exploiting standard Hilbert space methods an explicit solution for both, the electric field and the distribution function of the electrons for a bounded discharge configuration subject to an unsymmetrical excitation has been found for the first time. The model is applied to a low pressure inductively coupled plasma discharge. In this context particularly the anomalous skin effect and the effect of phase mixing is discussed. The analytical solution is compared with results from <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>full</b> wave particle in cell simulations.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the energy response of the anti-neutrino detector (AD), the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment installed a <b>full</b> <b>Flash</b> ADC readout system on one AD that allowed for simultaneous data taking with the current readout system. This paper presents the design, data acquisition, and simulation of the Flash ADC system, and focuses on the PMT waveform reconstruction algorithms. For liquid scintillator calorimetry, the most critical requirement to waveform reconstruction is linearity. Several common reconstruction methods were tested but the linearity performance was not satisfactory. A new method based on the deconvolution technique was developed with 1 % residual non-linearity, which fulfills the requirement. The performance was validated with both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and 1 % consistency between them has been achieved...|$|R

30|$|The {{solar wind}} {{interaction}} with a non-magnetized, electrically non-conducting body is studied using a two-dimensional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>full</b> particle simulation. The solar wind magnetic field is {{introduced into the}} simulation scheme as an initial condition together with the electric field generated by {{the motion of the}} solar wind. The solar wind magnetic field controls the direction of the thermal flow of the electrons and causes an asymmetry of the negative charging of the downstream-side surface. The negative charging and the potential drop are largest at the position where the solar wind magnetic field is perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} non-magnetized body. In the absence of photoelectrons, the solar wind electrons begin to be expelled by the negative charging at the terminator and then flow away along the field line producing streaks of enhancements of the electron density.|$|R

40|$|An {{extreme case}} of {{electron}} shock drift acceleration (SDA) in low Mach number collisionless shocks is investigated as a plausible {{mechanism for the}} initial acceleration of relativistic electrons in large-scale shocks in galaxy clusters, where the upstream plasma temperature is {{of the order of}} 10 keV and the degree of magnetization is not too small. One-dimensional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>full</b> particle simulations reveal that, even when a shock is rather moderate, a part of the thermal incoming electrons are accelerated and reflected through relativistic SDA and form a local non-thermal population just upstream of the shock. The accelerated electrons can self-generate local coherent waves and further be back-scattered toward the shock by those waves. This may be a scenario for the first stage of the electron shock acceleration occurring at the large-scale shocks in galaxy clusters, such as CIZA J 2242. 8 + 5301, which have well-defined radio relics...|$|R
