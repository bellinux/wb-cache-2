Whereas {{previous}} research found that spontaneously generated positive <b>fantasies</b> about the future predict poor achievement, we examined the effect of experimentally induced positive <b>fantasies</b> about the future. The present four experiments identify low energy, measured by physiological and behavioral indicators, as a mechanism by which positive <b>fantasies</b> translate into poor achievement. Induced positive <b>fantasies</b> resulted in less energy than <b>fantasies</b> that questioned the desired future (Study 1), negative <b>fantasies</b> (Study 2), or neutral <b>fantasies</b> (Study 3). Additionally, positive <b>fantasies</b> yielded a larger decrease in energy when they pertained to a more rather than a less pressing need (Study 4).

50|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted which has highlighted several gender differences in sexual <b>fantasies.</b> Some of the patterns which have frequently emerged include men's greater tendency to report sexual <b>fantasies</b> falling in the following categories: exploratory, intimate, impersonal, and sadomasochism. Exploratory <b>fantasies</b> include those of homosexual encounters and group sex, whilst <b>fantasies</b> of watching others engage in sexual intercourse and fetishism are classed as impersonal sexual <b>fantasies.</b> Women are also likely to report <b>fantasies</b> involving the same-sex partner, or those with a famous person, although both sexes have been found to prefer intimate <b>fantasies</b> over the other three types outlined, including <b>fantasies</b> of oral sex and sex outdoors.|$|R

In this volume contributors from different academic disciplines explore sexual <b>fantasies</b> at the convergence of the cultural and the individual, taking into account that <b>fantasies</b> are paradoxical: highly individualised and private, {{and at the same time}} dependent on a world that supplies structures, images, symbols, and narratives...|$|R

Gillings followed the demise of <b>Fantasy</b> by publishing a fanzine, titled <b>Fantasy</b> Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E

Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final <b>Fantasy</b> title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final <b>Fantasy</b> VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles.

Final <b>Fantasy</b> Mystic Quest was specifically developed for a United States audience, and Final <b>Fantasy</b> Tactics is a tactical RPG that features many references and themes {{found in the}} series. The spin-off Chocobo series, Crystal Chronicles series, and Kingdom Hearts series also include multiple Final <b>Fantasy</b> elements. In 2003, the Final <b>Fantasy</b> series' first direct sequel, Final <b>Fantasy</b> X-2, was released. Final <b>Fantasy</b> XIII was originally intended to stand on its own, but the team wanted to explore the world, characters and mythos more, resulting {{in the development and}} release of two sequels in 2011 and 2013 respectively, creating the series' first official trilogy. Dissidia Final <b>Fantasy</b> was released in 2009, a fighting game that features heroes and villains from the first ten games of the main series. It was followed by a prequel in 2011.

Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for Final <b>Fantasy</b> IV and Secret of Mana (known as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, {{the age of the}} original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the Final <b>Fantasy</b> II localization in favor of the recently released Final <b>Fantasy</b> IV (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled Final <b>Fantasy</b> II to reflect the jump in releases).|$|E

However, BDSM <b>fantasies</b> have become quite common among the general population, possibly due to its normalization by the popular Fifty Shades trilogy. The capitalization of the Fifty Shades trilogy changed the perception of BDSM from being extreme, marginalized and dangerous to being fun fashionable and exciting.
