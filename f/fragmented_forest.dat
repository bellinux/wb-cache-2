The population’s dependence on fuelwood for energy creates rings of <b>fragmented</b> <b>forest</b> around urban areas, which in turn calls for longer and longer forest excursions to supply a never ending demand for fuelwood. The United Nations Environment Prorgamme’s Post-conflict Environmental Assessment Synthesis for Policy Makers reported that approximately 89 heactares of forest was lost each day due to illegal fuelwood harvesting during the peak of the post-Second Congo War conflict.

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} modifies ecological {{patterns and}} processes through changes in species richness and abundance. In the coastal Maulino forest, central Chile, both species richness and abundance of insectivorous birds increases in <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> compared to continuous forest. Through a field experiment, we examined larvae predation in <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests.</b> Higher richness and abundance of birds foraging at <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> translated into more insect larvae preyed upon in <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> than in continuous forest.

40|$|Wind {{disturbance}} is {{an important}} ecological force in the tropics, especially in the cyclonic and hurricane zones from about 7 - 20 degrees latitude. Damage from intense winds may be especially severe in <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> because of their abrupt artificial margins and denuded surrounding landscapes. We review available information {{on the effects of}} windstorms on <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests,</b> synthesizing studies from Australasia, Amazonia and elsewhere in the tropics. Wind damage in fragmented landscapes can be influenced by a range of factors, such as forest-edge orientation, edge structure, the size of nearby clearings and local topography. We argue that wind disturbances are likely to interact with, and exacerbate, a range of deleterious environmental changes in <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests.</b> Among {{the most important of these}} are altered forest structure, shifts in plant species composition, exotic-plant invasions, reduced carbon storage and elevated vulnerability to fire. The damaging impacts of winds on <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> could potentially increase in the future, particularly if global warming leads to increasingly severe or frequent windstorms...|$|R

40|$|Insects {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to the adverse effects of forest fragmentation. It is now beyond any doubt that fragmentation-induced changes in abundance and species richness occur in many insect groups. However, the study of insects in <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> {{is still in its}} infancy and lacks real direction. Simple empirical studies are not answerlng the questions we most want to answer about fragmented systems. Are we in the midst of a mass-extinction crisis? What is the functional signlflcance of the immense insect biodiversity? Does biodiversity loss affect ecosystem functioning? A more focused, functional approach to the study of forest fragmentation is required to move beyond the description of pattern and to determine how changes in insect communities affect ecosystem processes in <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Industrial timber {{plantations}} severely impact biodiversity in Southeast Asia. <b>Forest</b> <b>fragments</b> survive within plantations, {{but their}} conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia plantations and <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> in South Sumatra to evaluate each habitat’s potential conservation value. To clarify {{the impact of}} habitat change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4 -year-old acacia plantation (AP 4), and 1 -year-old acacia plantation (AP 1). Estimated species richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP 4 and BLF, while AP 1 and RLF had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly {{divided into two groups}} by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> in our study site lacked several common tropical <b>forest</b> species, these <b>fragments</b> provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly <b>fragmented</b> <b>forests</b> in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in the surrounding landscape...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{response}} of species to anthropogenic landscape modification is essential to design effective conservation programs. Recently, insects {{have been used in}} empirical studies to evaluate the impact of habitat modification and landscape fragmentation on biological diversity because they are often affected rapidly by changes in land use. In this study, the use of the landscape matrix by dung and carrion beetles in a <b>fragmented</b> tropical rain <b>forest</b> in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve was analyzed. Fragments of tropical rain forest, forest-pasture edges, pastures, isolated trees, living fences (trees connected with barbed wire) and barbed wire fences were studied both near and far from <b>forest</b> <b>fragments.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>fragments</b> had the highest abundance values, but pastures had the highest dung and carrion beetle biomass. Habitat specificity was high for the beetles in the most dissimilar habitats. <b>Forest</b> <b>fragments</b> and forest-pasture edges had and shared the highest number of species, but they shared only two species with pastures, barbed wire fences and isolated trees. Only one forest species was found within living fences far from the <b>forest</b> <b>fragments.</b> However, approximately 37 % of the forest species were caught within living fences near the <b>forest</b> <b>fragments.</b> Therefore, forest-pasture edges function as hard edges and prevent movement among <b>forest</b> <b>fragments,</b> but living fences seem to act as continuous habitat corridors when connected to <b>forest</b> <b>fragments,</b> allowing <b>forest</b> beetles to move between the fragments. Further studies are necessary to determine the minimum width of living fences necessary to provide good corridors for these beetles and other species...|$|R

40|$|Pollination deficit {{could cause}} low yields in cashew (Anacardium occidentale) {{and it is}} {{possible}} that deforestation surrounding cashew plantations may prevent effective pollinators from visiting cashew flowers and contribute to this deficit. In the present work, we investigated the proximity effect of small and large <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> on the abundance and flower visits by feral Apis mellifera and wild native pollinators to cashew flowers and their interactions with yield in cashew plantations. Cashew nut yield was highest when plantations bordered a small <b>forest</b> <b>fragment</b> and were close to the large <b>forest</b> <b>fragment.</b> Yield from plantations that did not border small <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> but were close to the large <b>forest</b> <b>fragment</b> did not differ to yield from plantations at a greater distance to the large <b>forest</b> <b>fragment.</b> Flower visits by wild native pollinators, mainly Trigona spinipes, were negatively affected by distance to the large forest remnant and their numbers were directly correlated to nut yield. The number of A. mellifera visiting cashew flowers did not change significantly with distance to <b>forest</b> <b>fragments,</b> nor was it correlated with yield. We conclude that increasing the number of wild pollinator visits may increase yield, and proximity to large <b>forest</b> <b>fragments</b> are important for this...|$|R
