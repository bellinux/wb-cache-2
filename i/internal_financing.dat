40|$|A {{well-known}} but under-emphasized {{feature of}} the business cycle is that the flow of <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> is highly procyclical. We argue that finance constraints lead firms to offset {{a large proportion of}} <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> fluctuations through inventory (dis) investment. We construct three panels of quarterly firm data, each of which contains a large fraction of aggregate inventories and covers a major inventory cycle. Our findings show that the impact of <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> on inventory investment is greater for small firms than large, consistent with the existence of <b>finance</b> constraints. <b>Internal</b> <b>finance,</b> however, is also economically important for large firms. These results explain part of the large cyclical amplitude of inventory investment. Furthermore, heterogeneity in our results across time, especially between the 1981 - 82 recession and the 1990 - 91 recession, helps explain differences in the composition of aggregate investment shortfalls during contractions. ...|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the theory}} here, falls under the {{umbrella}} of the Trade-Off Theory in which firms are assumed to trade-off the tax benefits of debt with the bankruptcy costs of debt when choosing how to allocate the company's resources. However economists have developed a set of alternative theories about how managers allocate a corporation's finances. One of the main alternative theories of how firms manage their capital funds is the Pecking Order Theory (Stewart Myers), which suggests that firms avoid external financing while they have <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> available and avoid new equity financing while they can engage in new debt financing at reasonably low interest rates. [...] Also, Capital structure substitution theory hypothesizes that management manipulates the capital structure such that earnings per share (EPS) are maximized. An emerging area in finance theory is right-financing whereby investment banks and corporations can enhance investment return and company value over time by determining the right investment objectives, policy framework, institutional structure, source of financing (debt or equity) and expenditure framework within a given economy and under given market conditions. One of the more recent innovations in this area from a theoretical point of view is the Market timing hypothesis. This hypothesis, inspired in the behavioral finance literature, states that firms look for the cheaper type of financing regardless of their current levels of internal resources, debt and equity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the theory}} of capital structure, <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> is the name for a firm using its profits {{as a source of}} capital for new investment, rather than a) distributing them to firm's owners or other investors and b) obtaining capital elsewhere. It is to be contrasted with {{external}} financing which consists of new money from outside of the firm brought in for investment. <b>Internal</b> <b>financing</b> is generally thought to be less expensive for the firm than external financing because the firm does not have to incur transaction costs to obtain it, nor does it have to pay the taxes associated with paying dividends. Many economists debate whether the availability of <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> is an important determinant of firm investment or not. A related controversy is whether the fact that <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> is empirically correlated with investment implies firms are credit constrained and therefore depend on <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> for investment.|$|E

5000|$|Financing {{comes from}} three sources, {{internal}} funds, debt and new equity. Companies prioritize their sources of financing, first preferring <b>internal</b> <b>financing,</b> and then debt, lastly raising equity as a [...] "last resort". Hence: <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> is used first; {{when that is}} depleted, then debt is issued; {{and when it is}} no longer sensible to issue any more debt, equity is issued. This theory maintains that businesses adhere to a hierarchy of financing sources and prefer <b>internal</b> <b>financing</b> when available, and debt is preferred over equity if external financing is required (equity would mean issuing shares which meant 'bringing external ownership' into the company). Thus, the form of debt a firm chooses can act as a signal of its need for external finance.|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} of perfect capital markets is {{least likely to}} be satisfied for the class of firms which devote resources towards the development of innovative products or processes. Existing tests {{of the impact of}} capital market imperfections on innovative firms cannot distinguish between two alternative hypotheses: (i) that capital markets are perfect, and that different factors drive the firms different expenditures, and (ii) that capital markets are imperfect, and that the different expenditures of the firm respond disproportionately to a common factor, namely shocks to the supply of <b>internal</b> <b>finance.</b> However, an implication of the perfect capital markets assumption is that each of the firms expenditures should be equally insensitive to fluctuations in <b>internal</b> <b>finance.</b> Therefore, to distinguish between these hypotheses, the sensitivity of physical investment expenditures to <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> is compared across innovative and non-innovative firms. For robustness, several investment equations are estimated. The results support the hypothesis that innovative firms are financially constrained. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the best}} {{documented}} empirical facts in economic research has been the positive relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> and cash flows and capital expenditures and investment. But disputes about the analytical basis for the cash flow theory have been largely unresolved. There are two distinct approaches to the cash flow theory of investments: the managerial (managers are primarily interested in maximizing the firm's growth rate) and information theoretic (managers try to maximize shareholder value). Using a panel of US manufacturing firms (1972 - 90), the author tries {{to distinguish between the}} approaches. The results suggest that firms rely on <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> for capital expenditures because of managerial considerations. The principal shortcoming of the information-theoretic approach is its reliance on dividend practices as a decisive criterion for studying firm heterogeneity. Dividend practices are incapable of distinguishing between managerial and information-theoretic approaches. But one can distinguish between managerial and information-theoretic approaches using such variables as size, exchange listings and the ratio of R&D to sales and make contrasting predictions about the firm's reliance on <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> for capital expenditures. The evidence shows that the firm's observed reliance of capital expenditures on <b>internal</b> <b>finance</b> is driven by managerial rather than information-theoretic considerations. While no current research directly distinguishes between managerial and information theoretic approaches, preliminary evidence seems to favor the managerial approach. And even though the stock market may play a limited role as a source of finance, policy initiatives to reform the financial sector and develop capital markets are likely to enhance the overall efficiency of the resources allocation process in the economy.
