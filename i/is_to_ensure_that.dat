5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{caught off}} the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are {{required}} to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the province’s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the province.These requirements are known as minimum processing requirements, or MPRs. These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals {{in the same class}} must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
