SIMPL systems are a public key version of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Like a PUF, each SIMPL system S is physically unique and non-reproducible, and implements an individual function FS. In opposition to a PUF, every SIMPL system S possesses a publicly known numerical description D(S), which allows its digital simulation and prediction. However, any such simulation must work at a detectably lower speed than the real-time behavior of S. As argued in [1], SIMPL systems have practicality and security advantages over PUFs, Certificates of Authenticity (COAs), Physically Obfuscated Keys (POKs), and also over standard mathematical cryptotechniques.
