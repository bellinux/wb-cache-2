5|$|Central <b>eclipse</b> {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid <b>eclipse.</b> This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central <b>eclipse</b> is an <b>eclipse</b> during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total <b>eclipse),</b> but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular <b>eclipse.</b> The last (umbral yet) non-central solar <b>eclipse</b> was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular <b>eclipse.</b> The next non-central total solar <b>eclipse</b> will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
5|$|A hybrid <b>eclipse</b> (also called annular/total <b>eclipse)</b> shifts {{between a}} total and annular <b>eclipse.</b> At certain {{points on the}} surface of Earth, it appears as a total <b>eclipse,</b> whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are {{comparatively}} rare.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the longest}} {{duration}} {{in which the}} moon completely covered the sun, known as totality, was during the solar <b>eclipse</b> of July 22, 2009. This total solar <b>eclipse</b> had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 39 seconds. The longest possible duration of a total solar <b>eclipse</b> is 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The longest annular solar <b>eclipse</b> of the 21st century took place on January 15, 2010, {{with a duration of}} 11 minutes and 8 seconds. The maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds. The <b>eclipse</b> of May 20, 2050, will be the second hybrid <b>eclipse</b> in the span of less than one year, the first one being on November 25, 2049.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an <b>eclipse</b> {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the <b>eclipse.</b> The exact <b>eclipse</b> involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An <b>eclipse</b> recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular <b>eclipse</b> of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial <b>eclipse</b> was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar <b>eclipse</b> at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the <b>eclipse</b> (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eclipses</b> by Styx and Kerberos {{are more}} {{difficult}} to estimate, as both moons are very irregular, with angular dimensions of 76.9 x 38.5 to 77.8 x 38.9 arcseconds for Styx, and 67.6 x 32.0 to 68.0 x 32.2 for Kerberos. As such, Styx has no annular <b>eclipses,</b> its widest axis being more than 10 arcseconds larger than the Sun at its largest. However, Kerberos, although slightly larger, cannot make total <b>eclipses</b> as its largest minor axis is a mere 32 arcseconds. <b>Eclipses</b> by Kerberos and Styx will entirely consist of partial and hybrid <b>eclipses,</b> with total <b>eclipses</b> being extremely rare.|$|R

5|$|The April 15 <b>eclipse</b> was {{the first}} <b>eclipse</b> in a tetrad; that is, four {{consecutive}} total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between. There will be another <b>eclipse</b> every six lunar cycles during the tetrad â€“ on October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. The lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles, or 354 days, causing a date shift {{when compared to the}} solar calendar.

5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar <b>eclipse.</b> The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon.

40|$|This paper applies Gestalt {{psychology}} and associative network theory {{to examine the}} effect of <b>eclipsing</b> in celebrity endorsement on consumer attitude towards the endorsed brand. <b>Eclipsing</b> occurs when the celebrity overshadows the endorsed brand by dominating in an advertisement and diminishing the associative link between the celebrity and endorsed brand. Three studies take into account match-up, celebrity attachment, brand familiarity, and the moderating role of <b>eclipsing,</b> through manipulating two levels of <b>eclipsing</b> in advertising: (1) high <b>eclipsing,</b> when the celebrity is the focus, and (2) low <b>eclipsing,</b> when both the celebrity and brand are emphasized. Consumers who have a weak attachment to the celebrity endorser report a more positive brand attitude when they see the celebrity and endorsed brand both emphasized in an advertisement (low <b>eclipsing)</b> than when the celebrity overshadows and dominates the brand (high <b>eclipsing),</b> irrespective of whether consumers perceive the celebrity and brand to match or mismatch. For consumers with strong celebrity attachment, high <b>eclipsing</b> enhances brand attitude, regardless of whether they perceive the celebrity and brand to either match or mismatch. The findings of these studies have significant implications for advertisers and brand managers in the execution of their advertisements featuring endorsements. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a search for {{variable}} stars in the open cluster NGC 2141. Ten variable stars are detected, among which nine are new variable stars and they are classified as three short period W UMa type <b>eclipsing</b> binaries, two EA type <b>eclipsing</b> binaries, one EB type <b>eclipsing</b> binary, one very short period RS CVn type <b>eclipsing</b> binary, one d type RR Lyrae variable star, and one unknown type variable star. The membership and physical properties are discussed, based on their light curves, positions in the CMDs, spatial locations and periods. A known EB type <b>eclipsing</b> binary is also identified as a blue struggler candidate of the cluster. Furthermore, we find that all <b>eclipsing</b> contact binaries have prominently asymmetric <b>eclipses</b> and O Connell effect (O Connell 1951) which increases with the decrease of the orbital periods. This suggests that the O Connell effect is probably related to the evolution of the orbital period in short period <b>eclipsing</b> binary systems.

5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly.
