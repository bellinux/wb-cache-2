25|$|Archbishop Theodore {{refused to}} consecrate a new bishop. Instead he {{recalled}} Chad {{out of his}} retirement at Lastingham. According to Bede, Theodore was greatly impressed by Chad's humility and holiness. This was displayed particularly in his refusal to use a horse: he insisted on walking everywhere. Despite his regard for Chad, Theodore ordered him to ride on long journeys and {{went so far as}} to lift him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Canutt {{had been}} {{perfecting}} tricks {{such as the}} Crupper Mount, a leapfrog over the horse's rump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> Douglas Fairbanks used some in his film The Gaucho. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks' gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience. It was in Branded a Bandit (1924) that his nose was broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt's close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it looked better.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Nietzsche {{signed up}} for one year of {{voluntary}} service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was {{regarded as one of}} the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the pommel and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months. Consequently, Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with Richard Wagner for the first time later that year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it won't {{do no harm}} to {{go after}} him,--seein' as how he is steerin' in our direction," [...] said the old frontiersman, and, picking up the dead turkeys, they ran for their mustangs and leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles.</b>|$|R
60|$|Their old {{bicycles}} {{were still}} in the gymnasium. They were not in very good condition, but the tires were air-tight and that was enough. Without delay, they trundled the machines out, and leaping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles,</b> pedaled after Nat.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} he was down, and at my bidding Umslopogaas sprang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>saddle.</b>|$|R
500|$|Booth {{had left}} a horse waiting outside in the alleyway. [...] As he leapt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> Booth pushed Joseph Burroughs (the man holding the horse) away, {{striking}} Burroughs with the handle of his knife.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the smaller}} BR Standards the exhaust steam {{manifold}} within the smokebox saddle (along with the BR Standard Class 7 engines) was a steel casting that was welded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> Other original drawings [...] confirm the exhaust steam manifold was a steel fabrication {{in the smaller}} BR standards.|$|E
2500|$|Watching a steeplechase race is {{a rather}} simple undertaking, {{as it is the}} horse that comes over the finish line first that wins. However, before this occurs, several steps must be undergone. [...] First, the horse’s trainer must officially declare that the horse is on grounds for a {{specified}} period before the beginning of its race. [...] Furthermore, the rider must report to the clerk of scales and weigh out with the minimum prescribed weight. If the jockey and his gear do not meet the minimum weight requirement, lead is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> pad.|$|E
60|$|The troop was {{gathered}} in the deserted lane {{at the bottom of}} the garden and, on Harry's arrival, <b>the</b> men sprung <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> and galloped off. The rattle of musketry was now very heavy, but it suddenly stopped and, a moment later, shouts and yells told that the breach had been carried, and the yard found to be deserted.|$|R
5000|$|Several guitar manufacturers, such as Godin, offer guitar {{models with}} an {{integrated}} [...] "RMC hexaphonic pickup and preamp system" [...] that {{is compatible with}} Roland guitar-synth hardware. The RMC pickup system uses a piezo-crystal pickup device built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> of <b>the</b> guitar bridge. This piezo-pickup conducts the vibrations of the strings as a piezo-acoustic signal that can be converted into a (13-pin) hexaphonic synth signal. This setup {{can be found in}} the xtSA and the LGX models.|$|R
60|$|Approaching {{the valley}} with {{cautious}} silence, he wheeled into it {{at full speed}} {{at the head of}} his troop, and attacked the Christians so suddenly that they had no time to put the bridles upon their horses or even to leap <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles.</b> They made a confused but valiant defence, fighting among the rocks and in the rugged bed of the river. Their defence was useless; seventy-nine were slain, and the remaining eleven were taken prisoners.|$|R
2500|$|Because a rider {{must be able}} to {{move his}} or her legs while riding, {{stirrups}} cannot be attached on the body of the saddle itself, but rather must be attached in a manner that allows the rider's leg a full range of motion. [...] Therefore, stirrups are attached to a saddle by means of adjustable straps, called stirrup leathers. Depending on the design of a saddle, stirrup leathers may be attached to a [...] "stirrup bar," [...] a small forged steel bar embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> tree, or may be wrapped around the bars of the tree itself. [...] Because different riders are of different heights, and stirrups also may need to be adjusted up or down to accommodate different types of activity, stirrup leathers have buckles and holes that allow length to be adjusted.|$|E
60|$|And {{he lifted}} her, he blushing, she laughing, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|And casting one rope to the ground, Dan swung <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|He saw {{presently}} little figures sheathing swords {{come out}} from the houses and walk to the debris of the flying-machines the bomb had destroyed. Others appeared wheeling undamaged aeroplanes upon their wheels as men might wheel bicycles, and sprang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> and flapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. A string of three airships appeared far away {{in the east and}} flew towards the zenith. The one that hung low above Niagara city came still lower and dropped a rope ladder to pick up men from the power-house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-day!" [...] sang out Tom, {{and riding}} forward, {{he leaned over}} and caught the {{dangling}} reins. Then, watching his chance, he leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> other <b>saddle.</b>|$|R
60|$|Heyward, perceiving {{that the}} eyes of his {{companion}} were warily fastened {{on the rest of the}} band, fell back immediately, in order to avoid the appearance of any suspicious confederacy with their leader. Magua approached the horses, and affected to be well pleased with the diligence and ingenuity of his comrades. He then signed to Heyward to assist <b>the</b> sisters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles,</b> for he seldom deigned to use the English tongue, unless urged by some motive of more than usual moment.|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Menzies {{caught sight}} of his comrade's face as he sprang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary reluctantly {{allowed herself}} to be lifted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> and rode off with the trooper.|$|E
60|$|He did so, {{stopping}} {{a moment to}} pull the second girth tight. Then we helped Anscombe <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|At length {{the changes}} were completed, and Mr. George and Rollo, and also all the other {{passengers}} who had come in the diligence from Naples, began to take their places in the coach for Rome; {{while at the same}} time the other company got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Naples coach, which was now going to return. The conductor came for his buono mano, the new horses were harnessed in, <b>the</b> postilions leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles,</b> and thus both parties set out upon their night ride. It was not far from nine o'clock.|$|R
60|$|It was written, sealed, directed, {{and left}} upon {{the table at}} which they had so often been seated. Herbert descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>saddled</b> his horse, {{and in a few}} minutes, in the heart of night, had quitted Arquâ.|$|R
60|$|So Rollo {{gave the}} order, and <b>the</b> waiter went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house. In {{a moment he}} {{returned}} with two cups of very nice coffee, which he brought on a tray. By this time, however, the fresh horses were almost harnessed, {{so that it was}} necessary to drink the coffee quick. But there was no difficulty in doing this, for it was very nice, and not too hot. Rollo had barely time to give back the cups and pay for the coffee before the diligence began to move. The postilions started the horses with a strange sort of a cry, that they uttered while standing beside them, and then leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> just as they were beginning to run.|$|R
60|$|Leaping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> he {{was next}} instant {{on the track}} of the Indian chief, who had already disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Sack Todd was {{the last}} man to leap <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> As he did so, he gritted his teeth hard.|$|E
60|$|Saxon tightly gripped reins and mane, stepped with spurred foot on Billy's hand, and {{was lifted}} lightly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|So {{we climbed}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{embroidered}} <b>saddles</b> of <b>the</b> kneeling dromedaries, {{and a few}} minutes later were riding through Mur toward the pass, accompanied by our guard and hooting mobs that once or twice became threatening, but were driven off by the soldiers.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{seemed to}} think that the hint was not to be neglected; he flung down his reckoning, and going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stable, <b>saddled</b> and brought out a powerful black horse, now recruited by rest and forage, and turning to Morton, observed, [...] "I ride towards Milnwood, which I hear is your home; will you give me the advantage and protection of your company?" ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{waited for}} a minute or two, and then two Boers came out, mounted a couple of the ponies, and rode quietly down the street. At that moment another song was struck up. [...] "That is lucky. If anyone comes out and sees us {{mounting}} he will take us for the two men who have just ridden off." [...] Then they strolled leisurely across the street, took the reins of two of <b>the</b> ponies, sprang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles,</b> and started at a walk, which, twenty yards farther, was quickened <b>into</b> a trot. <b>The</b> two men had fortunately gone in the other direction. Once fairly beyond the town, they quickened their pace. [...] "Now we are Boers all over," [...] Chris said exultantly; [...] "but there is one thing, Sankey, we must be careful not to go near any solitary farmhouse. There must still be some loyal men left in these parts, and if we fell in with a small party of them the temptation to pay off what they have suffered might be irresistible." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the true}} {{state of the}} case flashed upon me. Langour fled. I leaped up, and {{scrambled}} somehow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|So Henry {{assisted}} Rollo to dismount, {{and then}} adjusted the stirrups to Mr. George's use, and Mr. George mounted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
60|$|So saying, he unbound {{his horse}} from the tree, threw himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> and rode at full gallop towards the Castle.|$|E
5000|$|Saddle stitch staplers {{or simply}} saddle staplers are {{bookbinding}} tools designed to insert staples <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spine (<b>saddle)</b> of folded printed matter such as booklets, catalogues, brochures, and manuals. They are distinguished by their unusual length (most traditional staplers are {{too short to}} staple booklets easily) and {{by the presence of}} a V-shaped hump or [...] "saddle" [...] which is used to precisely align the central fold of the material to be stapled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{the chief}} said, putting {{his hand on}} Tom's shoulder. [...] "Now let us ride." [...] He leapt <b>into</b> his <b>saddle,</b> <b>the</b> others {{following}} his example, and they went on at the same pace as before.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, Leland, after {{stopping}} {{some twenty}} minutes for breakfast, climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> binder's <b>saddle</b> and {{drove through the}} wheat until almost noon. He {{did not seem to}} see quite so well as usual, and his head ached almost intolerably. Gallwey's jacket also hampered him, until, tearing it off, he let it fall. It was afterwards found, ripped in several places by the knife and tied up in a sheaf. The day was fiercely hot, and the dust rose thick from crackling stubble and trampled soil, but Leland drove on, swaying now and then in his <b>saddle,</b> <b>the</b> perspiration dripping from him.|$|R
