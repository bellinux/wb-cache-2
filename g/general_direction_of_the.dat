5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points in the <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in the <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA gun carriage bearing system which allowed the entire cabin to be rotated around the vertical axis.

25|$|Finally, by {{the third}} week of November 2004, they decided to just post the film. They posted it to three blogs: Convergence Chaser, Snarkmarket, and Jason Kottke's popular blog. They never {{intended}} it to become as widespread as it did. But it soon became very popular. By December, the film was slashdotted. Several hundred links from various forums and blogs followed in early 2005. In January 2005, they released an update to the original movie, EPIC 2015. The sequel follows the same <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original, but also examines the roles of podcasting, GPS and web map services such as Google Maps.|$|E

25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow {{at the top of the}} screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi without paying the driver.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} launch mode {{was called}} Bearing-Only Launch (BOL). In this mode, the missile {{was launched in}} the <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target, and its radar activated {{from the beginning to}} scan for the target in a +/- 45° sector in front of the flight path. Once a target was located and the seeker locked the xGM-84A missile climbed rapidly to about 1800m before diving on the target in what was known as a [...] "pop-up maneuver". The 221kg (488lb) WDU-18/B penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead (in the WAU-3(V) /B warhead section) was triggered by a time-delayed impact fuze. When no target was acquired after radar activation, the Harpoon would self-destruct.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, during 52 {{hours of}} data {{recorded}} by the MIT probe before battery power ran out, Rossi's group found a transition between two distinct regions around earth. [...] Near earth. there were fairly strong and well organised magnetic fields, but no indication of interplanetary protons. [...] At 22 earth radii, the spacecraft entered a region where magnetic fields were weaker and more irregular, and where a substantial flux of protons was observed coming from the <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. [...] On several occasions {{during the rest of}} the flight, this flux disappeared and then reappeared again, which indicated that the spacecraft was flying close to the boundary between the two regions and that this boundary was moving irregularly. Eventually, this boundary became known as the magnetopause.|$|E

500|$|Before {{making a}} shot, the player may select a club {{and adjust the}} <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swing. As with other golf games, a [...] "swing meter" [...] is used to {{simulate}} the act of swinging the club. The player clicks three times: first to initiate the backswing, which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to [...] "snap" [...] the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on {{the far end of}} the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots. The crowd reacts to the player's shots, and Tournament mode features announcer commentary that analyzes the match overall; it can frame the player's current performance in the light of past shots.|$|E
