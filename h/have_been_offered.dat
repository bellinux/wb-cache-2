5|$|In {{matters of}} self-defence, {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered.</b> For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not {{protected by the}} rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures {{support the use of}} violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the entire}} crusader army is {{difficult}} to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> by modern historians. Crusader military historian David Nicolle considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000–35,000 crusaders, including 5,000 cavalry. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 infantry and 1,200 cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Jahanpanah was {{the fourth}} medieval city of Delhi {{established}} in 13261327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1321–51), of the Delhi Sultanate. To address the constant threat of the Mongols, Tughlaq built the fortified city of Jahanpanah (meaning in Persian: “Refuge of the World”) subsuming the Adilabad fort that had {{been built in the}} 14th century and also all the establishments lying between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri Fort. Neither the city nor the fort has survived. Many reasons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> for such a situation. One of which is stated as the idiosyncratic rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted the capital to Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{straightforward}} {{narrative of}} the attacks on Dál Riata, a number of interpretations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> of the relations between Óengus, Eadberht and Æthelbald in the period from 740 to 750. One suggestion is that Óengus and Æthelbald were allied against Eadberht, or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain, or bretwaldaship, Óengus collecting tribute north of the River Humber and Æthelbald south of the Humber. This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum Anglorum, and it has more recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by Frank Stenton—that {{it is based on}} a textual error and that Óengus and Æthelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship—is the correct one.|$|E
5|$|Hay Castle was {{substantially}} {{expanded in}} the 17th century, creating a Jacobean mansion. Two explanations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> by historians for this redevelopment. One option is {{that during the}} first half of the 17th century, Howell Gwynne built a manor house to the west of the old keep, which was replaced by a new mansion in 1660 by James Boyle of Hereford. Another reverses this sequence, suggesting that James Boyle left the castle to Howell Gwynne in 1603, and that the mansion was built at the beginning of the century. In either case, the Jacobean building was two storeys tall, three with its facade included, and featured seven dormer gables in a Dutch style and a large staircase. It was built from stone and incorporated the upper floors of the old keep into its design. Formal gardens were constructed outside the keep either around the start of the 17th century or after 1660. In 1702, the house was divided up among different tenants, and passed into the hands of the local Wellington family. Until 1812, the basement of the keep was used to supplement the town gaol.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{took control}} of the case {{on the grounds that the}} artwork could likely cross state lines. They have {{conducted}} hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard, Japanese and French authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers. The FBI believes the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including The Storm on the Sea of Galilee; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited. The FBI stated it believed to know the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased. They have declined to identify the individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System. While other mechanisms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> for many of these peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{character}} {{designs were}} drawn by Etsushi Sajima and {{were based on}} the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi. The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before he could see the animated versions of his designs. The other half of the series' creatures i.e. the various devils (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop designs were done by Hatsue Nakayama and color designs were done by Keiichi Funada. Finally leaving Kazuto Shimoyama to oversee this area of production as the art director. The musical score was composed by Kōtarō Nakagawa. Nakagawa was initially surprised to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>offered</b> to be the musical composer but took up the role as a challenge. In addition to Nagakawa, Sound Direction was done by Satoki Iida along with Sound Effects by Iki Okuda. Other staff members included Assistant Director Yoshimichi Hirai, Animation Designer Eriko Ito, Composite Director Katsufumi Sato, CG Director Yuji Koshida and Ayumu Takahashi as the series Editor and Producer Yasuo Suda.|$|E
