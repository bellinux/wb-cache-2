5|$|In 2000, Lexus {{introduced}} the IS line, {{a series of}} entry-level sport sedans. In 2001, the first convertible was introduced, {{as well as the}} SC 430, a redesigned ES 300 and the third generation LS 430. The GX 470 mid-size SUV debuted in 2002, followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003. The following year, Lexus recorded its 2 millionth U.S. vehicle sale, and the first luxury-branded production hybrid SUV, the RX 400h.

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the tractor gearing box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> revolutions by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> In this case losses in the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R

Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical reminders of the trade.|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} vehicle (EV) powertrain is {{fundamentally different from}} {{the internal combustion engine}} vehicle (ICEV) powertrain. It is mainly due to the difference in the production of driving force, one is from the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and one is from the combustion engine. Thus, the parameters of the EV powertrain cannot inherit from the ICEV powertrain. As the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> is the key component of the EV powertrain, the parameters of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> can be extended to the whole EV powertrain. Additionally, as the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> requirements for EV propulsion are very different from that for industrial application, some parameters of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> are unique to EV powertrain such as the efficiency map, the intermittent power, and the driving-cycle power...|$|R

40|$|A {{share of}} {{vehicles}} with electric powertrains, including {{pure electric vehicles}} and hybrid electric vehicles, is growing intensively nowadays.

5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. <b>Electric</b> <b>motors,</b> on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The {{design of}} <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems {{as we know}} it today, is very {{important}} and has a direct influence on the reliability of the system. In this dissertation, recommendations in design are given to obtain a reliable <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> system. This dissertation covers a literature review of reliability engineering, and this is then applied to an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> system {{in order to determine the}} reliability of the system. This dissertation is divided into five parts: Problem definition, theory and literature survey, economics of reliability engineering, analysis and synthesis of an electrical motor system, conclusions and recommendations. Part I describes the environment of an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> system and presents some fundamental concepts of reliability engineering. It emphasizes the importance of reliability analysis in the design of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems. Part II describes some theory and literature about reliability. It emphasizes some existing reliability analysis methods for development of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems. The reliability prediction method is very useful for analysis of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems. The author emphasizes that economics of reliability engineering should be taken into account in the design process in Part III. The analysis of life cycle costs is very important. Life cycle costs (LCC) usually consist of the initial investment, preventive maintenance costs, repair costs and the costs for production losses and outages due to failures and disturbances. Life cycle costing methodology is useful in analyzing the design, reliability and maintenance during trade off of technical systems and equipments. Part IV focuses a specific <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> system. Some existing reliability analysis methods are used to analyse reliability of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems. It is highlighted how to improve the reliability of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> systems. Some economics considerations are also presented in this section. The main conclusion reached in this dissertation is that failure data feedback, and accurate records are very important for reliability engineering. The author makes some recommendations for reliability of an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> system in design. This dissertation may contain direct information from sources indicated generally by.

U-1s gasoline engines {{were never able to}} meet the speed called for in the contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf. Despite the engine problems, U-1 and her sister ship had the best performance in diving and steering amongst the U-boats under evaluation by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for selection of gear number and transmission gear ratios in mechanical part of a wheel-type tractor with electro-mechanical transmission containing a propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with variablefrequency control. The paper proposes to determine a transmission gear ratio {{on the basis of}} the following: provision of wheel torque dependence on tractor speed which is the best one for a traction process and during transfer from one gear to the other; provision of nominal operational mode of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> for all tractor operations where it is working for a long period of time; provision of minimum possible number of gears; complete realization of internal combustion engine power on the tractor wheels at limit operational mode of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> As a characteristic of the asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with variable-frequency control contains various portions which can be used either completely or partially due to operating conditions, the gear number is determined in the process of transmission gear ration finding but not prior to this. A wheel torque of the tractor with electro-mechanical transmission can be limited according to the following factors: grip of wheel with supporting surface; maximum power of an internal combustion engine which can be transferred to the wheels and a torque which is developed by a propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> It is not proposed to exceed nominal operational mode of the propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> for all the operations of the tractor if it is working for a long period of time because in the case of significant excess of the nominal operational mode of the asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> its rather long operation leads to low efficiency and high losses in power, large heat liberation and consequently requires to develop more complicated system for <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> cooling. An excess of nominal <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> torque can be justified for short-term operational modes because in this case there is no need to select more powerful <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and create an additional gear in the gear-box. </p...|$|R
