50|$|In contrast, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{measurement}} {{is considerably}} more complex. The original <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled {{to the point}} where a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature. The <b>hygrometer</b> measures the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode {{to the surface of the}} mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two photo transistors are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is clear (direct) and scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls the mirror cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> If the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and maintaining continuous operation.|$|R
50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress the {{incoming}} <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Most dryers have a challenge air <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and pressure specification. So if the inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> with a challenge of +70 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of only 32 °F, the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R

5|$|<b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> is the {{temperature}} {{to which a}} given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called <b>dew.</b> The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is a saturation <b>point.</b> When the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity.

The compaction of the landfill clay liner at wet of optimum moisture content with a suitable type of compaction is the most common way of decreasing liner hydraulic conductivity. However, when the clay liner compacted in this way is located in an and region, it loses water and cracks. Cracks decrease the performance of the clay liner as a contaminant barrier.

40|$|Water vapor in the {{atmosphere}} {{plays an important role}} in radiative transfer and the process of radiative balance so critical for understanding global change. It is the principal ingredient in cloud formation, one of the most difficult atmospheric processes to model, and the most variable component of the Earth-atmosphere albedo. And as a free molecule, it is the most active infrared absorber and emitter, thus, the most important greenhouse gas. The radiative impact of water vapor is important at all levels of {{the atmosphere}}. Even though moisture decreases by several orders-of-magnitude from the Earth's surface to the tropopause, recent research has shown that, from a radiative standpoint, a small percentage change in water vapor at any level is nearly equivalent. Therefore accurate and precise measurements of this important atmospheric constituent are needed at all levels to evaluate the full radiative impact. The need for improved measurements in the upper troposphere is particularly important because of the generally hostile (very dry and cold) conditions encountered. Because of the importance of water vapor to the understanding of radiative transfer, the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program initiated a series of measurement campaigns at the Cloud And Radiation Testbed (CART) site in Oklahoma, especially focused on atmospheric water vapor. Three water vapor intensive observation period (water vapor IOP) campaigns were planned. Two of the water vapor IOP campaigns have been completed: the first IOP was held during the fall of 1996 with a focus on boundary layer water vapor measurements, and the second was conducted during the fall of 1997 with a focus on both boundary layer moisture e and moisture in the upper troposphere. This paper presents a review of the intercomparisons of water vapor measurements in the upper troposphere aquired during the second water vapor IOP.

40|$|The {{environmental}} simulation facility {{established at}} the Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZJ) is designed to investigate the performance {{of different types of}} balloon borne ozone sensors as well as air borne humidity sensors to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone and water vapor, respectively. Key component of the facility is a temperature and pressure controlled simulation chamber with a test room volume of about 500 liter (80 x 80 x 80 cm) whereby pressure as well as temperature can be dynamically regulated between 5 and 1000 hPa and between 200 and 300 K (- 2 K/min #<=# rate #<=# + 2 K/min) respectively. The volume mixing ratio of ozone can be dynamically regulated between 5 and 10000 ppbv up to a simulation altitude of about 35 km. The relative humidity in the chamber can be varied from about 95 % down to 2 % over a temperature range between + 30 C and - 70 C and pressure range between 1000 and 100 hPa. Ozone and humidity sensing devices can be calibrated against accurate reference instruments. A fast response dual beam UV-photometer serves as ozone reference. For the calibration of the water vapor sensors a <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> is used for lower/middle tropospheric humidity conditions, while for middle/upper tropospheric conditions a Lyman (#alpha#) fluorescence hygrometer serves as reference. The entire simulation process is computer controlled to provide reproducible conditions with respect to pressure, temperature, ozone concentration and humidity. Since 1994 the chamber is used for the regular (monthly) calibration of water vapor sensing devices which are flown aboard 5 civil ''in-service'' aircraft (Airbus-A 340) within the frame of the European project MOZAIC (measurement of ozone and water vapor on airbus in-service aircraft) for automatic monitoring of the water vapor distribution in the troposphere. The facility is also established as world calibration facility for ozone sondes (WCFOS) as part of the global atmosphere watch (GAW) program of the world meteorological organization (WMO). In the scope of this frame work several intercomparison experiments, JOSIE (=Juelich ozone sonde intercomparison experiment), were conducted to assess the performance of the major types of ozone sondes used within the global network of ozone sounding stations.

40|$|Introduction Enzymatic {{activity}} in solution is largely influenced by environmental {{factors such as}} the physical properties of the system. Viscosity is referred to as an index of the mobility of a system since it is related to the translational diffusion by the Stokes relationship. Kramers’ theory [1] predicts that the rate for the dynamics should have an inverse relationship with viscosity. Even if a large body of work indicates that Kramers’ theory does not always predict protein dynamics properly [2], large amplitude (global) protein motions and, in particular, those involving exterior portions of the protein, appear to follow Kramers’ relation at viscosities above ≈ 1 cP [3, 4] whilst diffusive motions involving smaller portions of the protein are less likely to follow Kramers’ relation at high viscosities [2]. Deviations from Kramers’ relation for exterior protein motions has been attributed to solvent composition and viscosity in the immediate vicinity of the protein. Independently of viscosity, other physical variables could affect the enzyme kinetics in solutions. In particular, in highly viscous concentrated solutions, water activity, which is a thermodynamical variable extensively used to describe the chemical potential of water in binary and complex systems, could play a significant role [5]. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and compare the effect of viscosity and water activity (aw) on the activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) in buffered solutions. HRP (44, 173. 9 Da) is an enzyme with an highly accessible active site whilst LPO is a larger enzyme (78, 431 Da) with a deeply buried active site with a restrictive substrate access channel which should limit the influence of physical properties of the solution (such as viscosity and water activity) on enzymatic catalysis. ExperimentalConcentrated binary and ternary buffered solutions with were prepared by using 0. 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, maltose, trehalose and maltodextrins (: 30. 000). HRP and LPO activity was tested in buffered solutions using the method of Keesey [6]. Viscosity was measured using a falling ball viscometer while water activity was measured using a <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> All measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry was used for the T’g determination. Thermograms were obtained after annealing at T’g + 10 °C. ResultsIn viscous solutions characterized by different composition, the inhibition of the HRP activity was dependent both on the thermodynamical properties of the solution, as described by water activity, and on the mobility of the system, as described by the inverse of viscosity and T-T’g. Viscosity was the most important factor in the inhibition of enzymatic {{activity in}} solutions characterized by the same T’g value, but when T’g was changed, due to changes in the solutes composition, the latter became the key factor in the regulation of the enzyme activity. HRP activity was much more influenced by changes in the water activity than LPO activity which, in turn, was much more influenced by changes in viscosity. The results of this study suggest that for large enzymes the translational diffusivity which, according to the Stokes-Einstein law, is inversely related to viscosity and molecular weight, is a far more critical factor than the accessibility of the active site. On the other hand, the water status of the solution seems to be a far more critical factor for the activity of enzymes with an active site highly accessible and expose to the external environment...|$|E
40|$|Stand {{establishment}} of crops by direct drilling {{is a function}} of seed germination and seedling emergence efficacy and their interactions with the soil physical micro-environment created by direct drill coulters. Experiments conducted in two contrasting controlled climates using 0. 5 tonne undisturbed turf blocks suggested that the three coulter types compared (viz. an experimental chisel coulter, a hoe and a triple disc coulter) performed significantly differently, in terms of wheat seedling emergence, when the seed was direct drilled into a fine sandy loam soil. Overall the chisel coulter promoted highest seedling emergence (63. 5 %) followed by the hoe coulter (50. 6 %) and the triple disc coulter (27. 0 %). When the initial soil moisture potential was close to permanent wilting point, seedling emergence counts between these three coulters were highly significant with the difference between the chisel and triple disc coulters being almost six-fold. When the initial soil moisture level was adequate, seedling emergence counts from the triple disc grooves, were Still significantly lower than from the chisel and hoe coulters which themselves performed equally. When the controlled relative humidity was increased from 60 % to 90 %, seedling emergence increased but this difference was significant only at a lower level of probability of P = 0. 10. Application of pressures (using press wheels) up to 70 kPa over the covered seeds after bar harrowing had no significant effect on seedling emergence at either the low or adequate initial soil moisture levels. When similar pressures were applied directly over the uncovered seeds, seedling emergence significantly increased to 60 % in the hoe coulter grooves and to 28 % in the triple disc coulter grooves compared to the impressed seeds. No significant increase was observed from the chisel coulter groove {{as a result of these}} pressures because it had already promoted a high seedling emergence count of 58 %. Further experiments, using small undisturbed turf blocks, to examine more closely the poor performance of the triple disc coulter, indicated that smearing had not been the main cause of seedling emergence failure. When the triple disc coulter grooves were modified using combinations of pressure applications and seed covering techniques, seedling emergence was significantly improved. It appeared that this improvement in seedling emergence was a function of a modified soil physical micro-environment at the seed-soil interface. Based on these results two hypotheses were evolved. The first hypothesis suggested that the transfer of liquid soil moisture to the seed for germination (and perhaps away from the unprotected seedling after germination but prior to emergence) could be altered by the shape of the seed groove and placement and covering of the seed. This was described as "soil moisture diffusion" The second hypothesis suggested that after the germination, subterranean seedling survival depended on the availability of vapour phase moisture which was also a function of the groove shape and covering medium. This was described as "soil moisture captivity". A thermo-electric <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> was used to measure the in-groove vapour moisture potential within the drilled grooves in the larger turf blocks, in a controlled environment. Significant and repeatable differences in the drying rates of the grooves created by the three coulter types were measured and promised to at least partly explain the underlying causes of their abilities (or lack of abilities in some cases) to promote seedling emergence. Combined counts of seedling emergence and sub-surface seedling survival were moderately correlated (r = 0. 71) with the corresponding rates of loss of in-groove soil vapour moisture. It appeared from the data that the important design characteristics for direct drilling coulters were that they must have the ability to both exploit the limited supply of sub-surface liquid moisture for germination and also retain soil moisture in the vapour form for seedling emergence and/or survival. The latter function appeared to be aided by the creation of minimum surface shattering and maintenance of a high incidence of surface mulch in the form of sod or organic matter. Field experiments suggested that when the only measured soil moisture data available was at or prior to drilling, the present state of knowledge would not permit accurate seedling emergence data to be predicted for any given coulter and covering technique. If however, soil moisture data was available for the period between drilling and seedling emergence, reasonable predictions of seedling emergence could be made, given the characteristics of the coulter types and covering techniques used. Examples of mathematical models were constructed for each of the three coulter types used, to predict seedling emergence as a function of these soil moisture data. The field experiments also confirmed that higher seedling emergence counts could be expected when the chisel coulter was used in dry soils compared with the hoe or triple disc coulters. During a typical spring-summer-autumn period in the Manawatu, when wheat seed was direct-drilled at fortnightly intervals into a "Tokomaru silt loam soil"; from 16 % of the drillings the chisel coulter promoted significantly higher seedling emergence counts than either the hoe or triple disc coulters...|$|E

According to a <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> calculator at this site (as an alternative, one may use the Antoine equation to obtain an approximate value), that partial pressure results in the local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of about 0.86 °C; in other words, the new local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is about equal to the new local temperature.|$|R
30|$|<b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> {{pressure}} {{is needed to}} characterize wet gas and gas condensate reservoir fluids. Industry practitioners often rely on measuring the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> (among other phase behavior properties) using laboratory experiments. In the absence of laboratory data, <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> estimation models (correlations) are usually available to estimate the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> with varying accuracy (discussed below). These models are based on either knowledge of fluid composition or knowledge of some surface fluid properties data (e.g., GCR, API of stock tank oil, and reservoir temperature). For many years, {{the oil and gas}} industry has been actively developing several tools to measure real-time in situ fluid composition and properties. To the best of our knowledge, we are unaware of any simple <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> estimation model based on the down-hole fluid composition measurements except the one we present here. Such model, when available, will allow rapid evaluation of <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> pressure before measuring it in the laboratory with common techniques and will have several applications.|$|R
5000|$|Vortex cores are {{regions of}} low pressure. As a vortex core begins to form, {{the water in}} the air (in the region that is about to become the core) is in vapor phase, which means that the local {{temperature}} is above the local <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> After the vortex core forms, the pressure inside it has decreased from the ambient value, and so the local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> (...) has dropped from the ambient value. Thus, in and of itself, a drop in pressure would tend to keep water in vapor form: The initial <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> was already below the ambient air temperature, and the formation of the vortex has made the local <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> even lower. However, as the vortex core forms, its pressure (and so its <b>dew</b> <b>point)</b> is not the only property that is dropping: The vortex-core temperature is dropping also, and in fact it can drop by much more than the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> does, as we now explain.|$|R
