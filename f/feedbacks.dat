5|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved {{in response to the}} drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane {{in the context of the}} global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate <b>feedbacks</b> and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.|$|E

The magnitude of <b>feedback</b> sign's influence became stronger over trials for self-efficacy, but its effect on satisfaction became weaker over trials for individuals {{with a high level}} of Conscientiousness.

40|$|Current {{methods in}} {{assessing}} a person’s receptivity to <b>feedback</b> are inherently biased. First, these methods are founded upon differing assumptions about <b>feedback</b> availability. <b>Feedback</b> seeking, operationalized as effort toward acquiring <b>feedback,</b> assumes <b>feedback</b> must be actively sought, also thus assumes <b>feedback</b> is not imminent. <b>Feedback</b> avoidance, operationalized as effort toward delaying or avoid receipt of <b>feedback,</b> assumes <b>feedback</b> must be actively avoided, and thus also assumes <b>feedback</b> is imminent.

This research provides a more comprehensive account of <b>feedback</b> receptivity by systematically varying both motivations and <b>feedback</b> availability and examining their relative effects on receptivity. The data supported the influence of motivated factors on receptivity but failed to support the influence of defaulted <b>feedback</b> availability on receptivity. Further, coping resources, perceived utility, and perceived <b>feedback</b> recommendation influenced receptivity.

25|$|Without climate <b>feedbacks,</b> a {{doubling}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration {{would result in}} a global average temperature increase of around 1.2°C.

This is an amplification of the carbon dioxide forcing by a factor of 2.5. Some studies suggest a lower climate sensitivity, but other studies indicate a sensitivity above this range. Partly because of the difficulty in modeling the cloud feedback, the true climate sensitivity remains uncertain.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of <b>feedback</b> types (i. e., outcome, process, and task <b>feedback),</b> <b>feedback</b> propensities, and their {{interactions}} on task performance in an attempt to determine, first, which types of <b>feedback</b> produced better task performance and, second, how <b>feedback</b> propensities influenced relationships between <b>feedback</b> type and performance.

In addition, I predicted that external <b>feedback</b> propensity would moderate the effects of process <b>feedback</b> on performance and initial task performance would moderate the effects of internal <b>feedback</b> propensity on task performance. However, none of the hypotheses were directly supported. Overall, the current study demonstrated support for the proposition that <b>feedback</b> does not consistently improve performance.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} how {{the characteristics of}} <b>feedback</b> receiver, <b>feedback</b> deliverer and <b>feedback</b> information influence psychological <b>feedback</b> reactions of the <b>feedback</b> receiver while largely neglecting that <b>feedback</b> intervention {{is a kind of}} social interaction process. To address this issue, this study proposes that employees’ perceived insider status (PIS), as a kind of employee-organization relationship, could also influence employees’ reactions to supervisory <b>feedback.</b> In particular, this study investigates the influence of PIS focusing on affective and cognitive <b>feedback</b> reactions, namely <b>feedback</b> satisfaction and <b>feedback</b> utility. Surveys were conducted in a machinery manufacturing company in the Guangdong province of China. Samples were collected from 192 employees. Data analysis demonstrated that PIS and <b>feedback</b> utility possessed a U-shaped relationship, whereas PIS and <b>feedback</b> satisfaction exhibited positively linear relationships. The analysis identified two kinds of mediating mechanisms related to <b>feedback</b> satisfaction and <b>feedback</b> utility. Internal <b>feedback</b> motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS and <b>feedback</b> satisfaction but failed to do the same with respect to the relationship between PIS and <b>feedback</b> utility. In contrast, external <b>feedback</b> motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS and <b>feedback</b> utility while failing to mediate the relationship between PIS and <b>feedback</b> satisfaction.

25|$|Soil {{respiration}} and its rate across ecosystems {{is extremely}} important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays {{a large role in}} global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive <b>feedbacks</b> with global climate change. Positive <b>feedbacks</b> are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|E

25|$|Travel 2.0 refers a {{model of}} Web 2.0 on tourism {{industries}} which provided virtual travel communities. Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and <b>feedbacks</b> on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative <b>feedbacks</b> which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative <b>feedbacks</b> would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative <b>feedbacks</b> on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E
