60|$|In this {{petition}} {{there are}} six things considerable: 1. That justice might be deferred. O that justice might be deferred! 'Lord, let it alone,' &c., a while longer. 2. Here is time prefixed, as a space to try if more means will cure a barren fig-tree. 'Lord, let it alone this year also.' 3. The means to help it are propounded, 'until I shall dig about it, and dung it.'[12] 4. Here is also an insinuation of a supposition, that, by thus doing, God's expectation may be answered; 'and if <b>it</b> <b>bear</b> fruit, well.' 5. Here is a supposition that the barren fig-tree may yet abide barren, when Christ hath done what he will unto it; 'and if <b>it</b> <b>bear</b> fruit,' &c. 6. Here is at last a resolution, that if thou continue barren, hewing days will come upon thee; 'and if <b>it</b> <b>bear</b> fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.' But to proceed according to my former method, by way of exposition.|$|R
