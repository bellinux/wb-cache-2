40|$|Theory on {{the value}} of {{business}} relationships has considerably improved in the latest years, also thanks to cross-fertilization from psychology and sociology studies. Anyway, while the contribution to the academic field has been substantive, theory {{on the value}} of business relationships has not found a real and effective application to managerial practice. This paper is aimed at identifying which are the key factors managers face in dealing with relationship value and find out possible relational strategies value-based to manage them. The empirical research is based on a mixed method study, composed by a survey to 171 managers and 84 interviews. <b>Evidences</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that, notwithstanding the complexity of the value concept in a relational and interactional contexts, specific relational strategies value-based are needed to manage value processes.

While some would argue that there is, indeed, a Newfoundland identity, and to some degree nationalism, very few would be able to explain why the former has not been expressed politically. This is important since in areas like Ireland and Quebec, the unique identity felt there has led to nationalism. [...] While the evidence supports the argument that young Newfoundlanders in this sample have a strong sense of identity, the evidence indicates that it has not resulted in nationalism.

40|$|Abstract The {{modular concept}} of {{cerebellar}} connections has been advocated in the lifetime work of Jan Voogd. In this concept, a cerebellar module {{is defined as}} the conglomerate of one or multiple and non-adjacent, para-sagittally arranged zones of Purkinje cells, their specific projection to a well-defined region of the cerebellar nuclei, and the climbing fiber input to these zones by a well-defined region of the inferior olivary complex. The modular organization of these olivo-cortico-nuclear connections is further exemplified by matching reciprocal connections between inferior olive and cerebellar nuclei. Because the different regions of the cerebellar nuclei show highly specific output patterns, cerebellar modules have been suggested to constitute functional entities. This idea is strengthened by the observation that anatomically defined modules adhere to the distribution of chemical markers in the cerebellar cortex suggesting that modules not only differ in their input and output relations but also may differ in operational capabilities. Here, I will briefly review some recent data on the establishment of cerebellar modules in rats. Furthermore, some <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> suggesting that the other main afferent system (i. e., mossy fibers), at least to some extent, also adheres to the modular organiza-tion. Finally, using retrograde transneuronal tracing with rabies virus, some <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be provided that several cerebellar modules may be involved in the control of individual muscles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{systems such}} as Road Runner, there is a trend in super {{computing}} to offload parallel tasks to special purpose co-processors, composed of many relatively simple scalar processors. The cheaper commodity class equivalent of such a processor would be the graphics card, potentially offering super computer power {{within the confines of}} a desktop PC. Graphics cards however are not without problems, these range from the lack of double precision on most cards to a fairly steep drop in performance for using double precision on others, the end result being that in order to utilize the graphics card the computation must be done using single precision. In this paper we propose a method whereby a whole digit of the accuracy lost in single precision matrix multiply can be regained with only a 7 % loss in performance by applying a compensated summation algorithm in a manner previously unexplored, a manner in which, at first glance, shouldn’t provide any benefit but empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that though the novel idea is simple, provides unexpected benefits in terms of accuracy at little cost to performance...|$|E
40|$|The Coyote Cycle of {{oral history}} of the Coeur D’Alene people is rich in {{etiological}} content.

A specific case study of an auxiliary character with emphasis on thematic role in the narratives explains some of the intent in these oral histories.

40|$|There is an implicit, but untested, {{assumption}} in {{the theory}} of securitization that securitization of an issue area is, in general, a problem, as it rules the issue area outside the reach of democratic accountability, and brings in the privilege of state-centered, militaristic thinking. In this chapter, such an assumption is tested in the case of territorial disputes of the South China Sea. Furthermore the chapter will look at the way in which developmentalist discourses have changed, and how legalistic framing could change the strategic debate in East Asia with regards, to the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. While the theory of securitization has so far suggested that “security” cannot be “unspoken” the analysis of this chapter shows that alternative framing that is in practice incompatible with the security framing, could actively desecuritize issues that have been seen as security issues. Finally, the chapter will reveal {{the way in which the}} desecuritization of territorial disputes makes territorial disputes less dangerous. Empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> about this in the case of developmentalist desecuritization, while the treatment of opportunities to frame territorial disputes in legal terms will be more speculative...|$|R
40|$|A {{closer look}} at the colonial {{practices}} of the Spaniards in Peru and the increase of political power through the reforms of Francisco de Toledo and how that indirectly influenced social changes within the Indio caste system.

Amidst the expanding colonial society, an unexpected social backlash developed amongst the Indios. To a great degree these social changes can be attributed to Francisco de Toledo's reforms, which enlarged the overall number of royal and local officials, who desired to manipulate the system and enrich themselves. Toledo's reforms permitted a larger majority of Spaniards to exploit the Indios ' productivity, increase their revenues and appease the crown. To some degree, both indirectly and direct 1 y, the reforms encouraged the Indios to assimilate, adapt, change or hide in order to escape the obligations of the Indio caste system.

40|$|Competition policy {{emerged as}} an {{important}} area of interest during the later stages of Uruguay Round negotiations. The task of establishing competition policy {{is complicated by the}} fact that there already are trade statutes [...] -antidumping, countervailing duty, safeguard actions [...] -that relate to issues of competition. Interestingly, the existing trade statutes often seemed designed to reduce the effect of foreign competition on domestic producers. The tension between the existing trade statutes and competition policy is most probably most clearly evidenced by antidumping law, the most widely used trade statute. In this paper I will concentrate on how one specific amendment, the cumulation provision, clearly makes AD an anti-competitive law and exemplifies the challenges that face those policy-makers who hope to move toward to an economically justified competition policy. <b>Evidence</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that cumulation has led to more multiple petition filings and to smaller competitors being named. I will also argue that cumulation has changed the outcome (from negative to affirmative) in dozens, and possibly hundreds, of cases.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} based on a five month long anthropological {{fieldwork}} in Nairobi, Kenya. The target group of the study is the urban middle class in Nairobi. In the search of understanding/grasping what middle class life is all about, one phrase was frequently cited as a clear definition and desire of middle class life. This phrase was the good life and this gradually became the core element in my fieldwork and also in this thesis. Who belongs to the middle class and who does not, is not something clear nor static, but rather dynamic. The membership of urban middle class can be negotiated and the key is participation in the good life. What is considered as the good life differs, but it is always manifested and performed through spending (or consuming) money. Due to historical processes, places within the city are not neutral, rather loaded with meaning and social status. The place of consumption is therefore of high relevance. Through empirical <b>evidence</b> I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> how the urban middle class strategically uses consumption and places within the city in order to manifest and perform the good life...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper {{is to provide a}} {{characterization}} of how non-native speakers negotiate their own identity and try to establish themselves as language users rather than as language learners, on occasion of cross-cultural encounters. Taking into account a series of interviews and a panel discussion recorded from BBC World and CNN International, the study will claim that, in international encounters, when English constitutes the main or only means of communication and the primary preoccupation is mutual intelligibility, it is advisable to introduce the notion of ELF (English as a Lingua Franca), rather than refer to the yardstick of ENL (English as a Native Language). The <b>evidence</b> collected <b>will</b> <b>show</b> that non-native speakers can engage in conversations that are not only meaningful but also ‘normal’ and ‘ordinary’ (Firth 1996). Even though the corpus of data gathered {{for the purpose of this}} work is not very large and cannot claim to provide an exhaustive description of the uses of English as a lingua franca, it can show how non-native speakers successfully negotiate meaning, as well as their own identity, and get their interlocutors (mainly native-speakers) to accept them as ELF speakers rather than EFL learners...|$|R
