5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Australian {{government}} had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's global security interests. In line with this new focus, the ADF's <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> changed {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} <b>force</b> <b>structure,</b> the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E

5|$|Funding {{shortfalls}} have constrained {{the development}} of the F-FDTL. The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the Oecussi enclave and two reserve infantry battalions. These units formed {{an important part of the}} King's College report's option3 <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> and their absence may have impacted on East Timor's defence policy. As of 2011 the government was yet to announce what, if any, reserve units would be formed, though provisions for such units had been included in legislation.|$|E

5|$|While it was {{intended}} to sell the Chinooks after they were withdrawn from service, experience soon demonstrated that the Black Hawks were unable to fully replace them. In particular, it was found that heavy-lift helicopters were needed to transport fuel supplies for the Black Hawks during exercises and operations. As a result, plans to sell the Chinooks were put on hold in late 1989, and the Army and RAAF began investigating options to reactivate them. The 1991 <b>Force</b> <b>Structure</b> Review recommended that between four and six Chinooks—preferably upgraded to CH-47D standard—be reactivated to support the Black Hawks.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} {{following the}} outbreak of World WarII, No.1 Group was formed under Wrigley's command in Melbourne on 20November 1939, to oversee the operations of air bases and units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Promoted air commodore, in 1940 Wrigley served as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Southern Area, the successor organisation to No.1 Group, before taking up the position of Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in November that year. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. As AMP, Wrigley's responsibilities included organising the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), established on 25March 1941 as the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in the country. He believed that recruiting servicewomen was essential to augment the many ground staff required to support the war effort, and considered that while such an organisation should be constitutionally separate from the RAAF, its members should be closely integrated within the current <b>force</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{participated in}} the {{recovery}} efforts following the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977. Over 300 members of the unit were dispatched to New York State to help with recovery efforts. As requirements and the engineer <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> changed, the brigade inactivated the combat heavy battalion in 1987 and activated another combat airborne battalion. In 1989, the 30th Engineer Battalion (Topographic) {{was added to the}} brigade. Over the years, the brigade has provided engineer support to XVIII Airborne Corps and other Army commands. In addition to training, it has deployed in support of operations across the entire spectrum of conflict from disaster relief to combat operations.|$|E

5|$|The brigade was {{reactivated}} in 1986 at Fort Drum, New York, {{as part of}} {{the third}} Light Infantry Division in the new Army of Excellence <b>force</b> <b>structure.</b> The 1st Brigade consisted of three organic battalions: 1–32nd Infantry, 1–87th Infantry, and 2–22nd Infantry. For exercises and operational employment, the brigade formed the core of TF Warrior, receiving attachments that habitually included 3–6th Field Artillery, 10th Forward Support Battalion, A/3-62nd Air Defense Artillery, A/41st Engineer, A/110th Military Intelligence, A/10th Signal Battalion, and 1st PLT/10th Military Police Company. After its activation, the brigade participated in numerous exercises, including Honduras, Panama, the National Training Center (Fort Irwin, CA), the Joint Readiness Training Center (Fort Polk, LA), REFORGER 88 and 90, and operational deployments to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E
5|$|With few modern tanks at {{the time}} of the Korean War, the Australian Army had to rely on British and US tank support. During the 1950s the Army {{standardised}} on the British Centurion tank, which saw action in Vietnam and remained in service until it was replaced with the German Leopard 1 in the mid-1970s. After an internal debate on whether the Army should continue to operate tanks as part of its <b>force</b> <b>structure,</b> the Australian Government replaced the Leopards with a small fleet of American M1A1 Abrams tanks in 2007, which are now the Army's only tanks. In addition to these types, the Army has operated small numbers of other tank designs for training and evaluation purposes.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a preliminary cost and operational effectiveness analysis of alternative <b>force</b> <b>structures</b> for the United States Marine Corps operational support airlift and {{search and rescue}} missions. The four alternative <b>force</b> <b>structures</b> include C- 12 s and CH- 46 Es, C- 35 s and CH- 46 Es and HV- 609 s. Lifecycle cost analysis of the alternative <b>force</b> <b>structures</b> using Crystal Bali forecasting {{provides a}} 90 % upper confidence level lifecycle cost estimate that identifies a mix of C- 35 s for operational support airlift and CH- 46 Es for search and rescue as the least expensive alternative. Operational effectiveness analysis provides a measure of overall utility {{for each of the}} four alternative <b>force</b> <b>structures</b> based on five measures of effectiveness. The measures of effectiveness examined are air travel time, total travel time, landing site requirements, range versus time on station, and payload versus range. Analytical hierarchy process rankings indicate that the HV- 609 is the preferred alternative considering these measures of effectiveness. Analysis of cost versus operational effectiveness identifies the HV- 609 as the most cost and operationally effective alternative for fulfilling the Marine Corps operational support airlift and search and rescue missions.

5|$|The {{demands of}} combat during World War II led {{to changes in}} the {{composition}} of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed. The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry. These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944, reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men. Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level. The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced, but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful. As a result, the divisions were strengthened for their 1944–45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed. The creation of the jungle divisions represented {{the first time in the}} Australian Army's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which its forces would fight. Previously <b>force</b> <b>structure</b> had been heavily influenced by the British Army, and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence. Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier <b>force</b> <b>structure,</b> as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning. Ultimately, while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia, they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese. As a result, the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised, while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties.|$|E
