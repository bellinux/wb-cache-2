An assignment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> creditors is designed to save time and expense by concluding the affairs of a bankrupt company. <b>The</b> assignment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> creditors is a state form of bankruptcy action versus a federal form of bankruptcy action. <b>The</b> assignment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> creditor’s process is similar in character to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and parallels {{some of the same}} procedures, but is not an actual [...] "bankruptcy" [...] in the form the word is used in the United States.|$|R

5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E

5|$|The Ormulum {{consists}} of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching {{on each of}} the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar (Treharne 2000, p.273).

The motivation was to provide an accessible English text <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the Vulgate, and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all (Treharne 2000, p.273).|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hohenstaufen authority Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily. These revolts resulted in some acts of violence, and the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under Frederick II. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to Lucera in Apulia and Girifalco in Calabria, where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under Charles II of Naples, {{and many of its}} inhabitants sold into slavery. The Jewish community was expelled after {{the establishment}} of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.|$|E

Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home.

Robert Bathurst has complained that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised.

5|$|During the 19thcentury {{the estate}} was again {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} the estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete.

Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had {{by far the best}} of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets.
