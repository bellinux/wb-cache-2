5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific <b>integrin,</b> alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular <b>integrin</b> was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 <b>integrin</b> subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 <b>integrin</b> functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Entry to {{the cell}} begins through {{interaction}} of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) and both CD4 and a chemokine receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the cell surface. gp120 binds to <b>integrin</b> α4β7 activating LFA-1 the central <b>integrin</b> involved {{in the establishment of}} virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to <b>integrin</b> αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Integrins</b> can be {{categorized}} in multiple ways. For example, some α chains have an additional structural element (or [...] "domain") inserted toward the N-terminal, the alpha-A domain (so called {{because it has a}} similar structure to the A-domains found in the protein von Willebrand factor; it is also termed the α-I domain). <b>Integrins</b> carrying this domain either bind to collagens (e.g. <b>integrins</b> α1 β1, and α2 β1), or act as cell-cell adhesion molecules (<b>integrins</b> of the β2 family). This α-I domain is the binding site for ligands of such <b>integrins.</b> Those <b>integrins</b> that don't carry this inserted domain also have an A-domain in their ligand binding site, but this A-domain is found on the β subunit.|$|R
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that there is extensive crosstalk between <b>integrins</b> and TGF-β signalling. TGF-β affects integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration by regulating the expression of <b>integrins,</b> their ligands and integrin-associated proteins. Conversely, several <b>integrins</b> directly control TGF-β activation. In addition, a number of <b>integrins</b> can interfere with both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGF-β signalling in different ways, including the regulation of the expression of TGF-β signalling pathway components, the physical association of <b>integrins</b> with TGF-β receptors and the modulation of downstream effectors. Reciprocal TGF-β–integrin signalling is implicated in normal physiology, {{as well as in}} a variety of pathological processes including systemic sclerosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer; thus, <b>integrins</b> could provide attractive therapeutic targets to interfere with TGF-β signalling in these processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The/ 32 <b>integrins</b> (LFA- 1, Mac-l, and p 150, 95) are {{critical}} for many adhesive functions of leukocytes. Although the binding of the IgG-opsonized particles occurs normally {{in the absence of}} B 2 <b>integrins,</b> phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles by activated neutrophils (PMN) requires these <b>integrins.</b> This observation suggests a role for/ 32 <b>integrins</b> in phagocytosis subsequent to particle binding. To investigate the mechanism of involvement of ~ 2 <b>integrins</b> in IgGmediated functions, we examined the role of/~ 2 <b>integrins</b> in adhesion to immune complex (IC) -coated surfaces.

5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to <b>integrin</b> signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E
25|$|GPCRs {{downstream}} signals {{have been}} shown to possibly interact with <b>integrin</b> signals, such as FAK. <b>Integrin</b> signaling will phosphorylate FAK, which can then decrease GPCR Gαs activity.|$|E
25|$|Galectins {{can both}} promote and inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion. To enhance integrin-mediated adhesion, they cross link between two glycans on {{different}} cells. This brings the cells closer together so <b>integrin</b> binding occurs. They can also hinder adhesion by binding to two glycans {{on the same}} cell, which blocks the <b>integrin</b> binding site. Galectin-8 is specific for the glycans bound to <b>integrin</b> and has a direct role in adhesion as well as activating integrin-specific signaling cascades.|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} <b>integrins</b> exist, and one cell may have {{multiple}} different types on its surface. <b>Integrins</b> {{are found in}} all animals.|$|R
30|$|These <b>integrins</b> are {{currently}} expressed in glioma cells and in neo-vessel endothelial cells, {{in conjunction with}} tumor-related angiogenic processes [6]. The expression of αvβ 3 <b>integrins</b> increases with the malignancy grade of the glioma and appears particularly important in high-grade gliomas where αvβ 3 <b>integrins</b> may facilitate tumor progression [7]. Most of the radiotracers that bind these <b>integrins</b> contain one or several tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) amino acid sequences owing to their high affinity for αvβ 3 <b>integrins</b> [4, 5, 8 – 11]. While some of these RGD-containing peptides have been labeled with Fluor- 18, their synthesis appears to be too complex for routine applications despite their high diagnostic potential [9, 12].|$|R

25|$|Galectin-8, which {{increases}} integrin-mediated adhesion, {{has been shown}} to be downregulated in some cancers. This benefits the cancer since <b>integrin</b> interactions with the extracellular matrix prevent metastasis. Lung cancer studies, however, have demonstrated increased adhesion to galectin-8 with increased metastatic potential, which may be mediated by elevated surface expression and activation of <b>integrin</b> α3β1.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{of adenoviruses}} into the host cell {{involves}} {{two sets of}} interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This {{is followed by a}} secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein interacts with an <b>integrin</b> molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αv <b>integrin.</b> Binding to αv <b>integrin</b> results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αv <b>integrin</b> stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an endosome.|$|E
25|$|Cellular {{activation}} via extracellular chemokines causes pre-formed β2 integrins to {{be released}} from cellular stores. <b>Integrin</b> molecules migrate to the cell surface and congregate in high-avidity patches. Intracellular <b>integrin</b> domains associate with the leukocyte cytoskeleton, via mediation with cytosolic factors such as talin, α-actinin and vinculin. This association causes a conformational shift in the integrin's tertiary structure, allowing ligand access to the binding site. Divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) are also required for integrin-ligand binding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Integrins</b> {{involved}} in cellular adhesion are primarily expressed on leukocytes. β2 <b>integrins</b> on rolling leukocytes bind endothelial cellular adhesion molecules, arresting cell movement.|$|R
30|$|<b>Integrins</b> {{control the}} {{attachment}} of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{and participate in}} cellular defense against genotoxic assaults (Hynes 2002). <b>Integrins</b> are expressed in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells (Varner & Cheresh 1996 a; Varner & Cheresh 1996 b; Varner et al. 1995), and they play important roles in angiogenesis and invasion in glioma (Friedlander et al. 1995; Brooks et al. 1994 a; Brooks et al. 1994 b). αvβ 3 and αvβ 5 <b>integrins</b> regulate cell adhesion (Hodivala-Dilke et al. 2003; Leavesley et al. 1992), and inhibitors of these <b>integrins</b> suppress tumor growth in certain pre-clinical models (MacDonald et al. 2001). Therefore, <b>integrins</b> have attracted attention as potential therapeutic targets in glioma.|$|R
40|$|AbstractG protein-activated K+ channel (GIRK) {{subunits}} {{possess a}} conserved extracellular integrin-binding motif (RGD) and bind directly to β 1 <b>integrins.</b> We expressed GIRK 1 /GIRK 4 channels labeled with {{green fluorescent protein}} in fibroblast cell lines expressing or lacking β 1 <b>integrins.</b> Neither plasma membrane localization nor agonist-evoked GIRK currents were affected {{by the absence of}} β 1 <b>integrins</b> or by incubation with externally applied RGD-containing peptide. Mutation of the aspartate (D) of RGD impaired currents, GIRK glycosylation, and membrane localization, but the interaction with β 1 <b>integrins</b> remained intact. Thus, β 1 <b>integrins</b> are not essential for functional GIRK expression; and the GIRK-integrin interactions involve structural elements other than the RGD motif...|$|R
25|$|CYR61 binds {{directly}} to various <b>integrin</b> receptors {{in a cell}} type-dependent manner, including <b>integrin</b> αvβ3 in endothelial cells, α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells αIIbβ3 in activated platelets, αMβ2 in monocytes and macrophages, and αDβ2 in macrophage foam cells. Where examined, syndecan-4 {{has been identified as}} the HSPG critical for CCN1 functions. The CYR61 binding sites for some of these integrins have been mapped (Figure 1). Due to the cell type specificity of <b>integrin</b> expression, CYR61 acts through distinct integrins to mediate specific functions in different types of cells. For example, CYR61 induces angiogenic functions in endothelial cells through αvβ3, and in fibroblasts promotes cellular senescence and enables TNFα to induce apoptosis through binding to α6β1-HSPGs. However, CYR61 supports cell adhesion through all of the integrins identified above.|$|E

40|$|The <b>integrins</b> {{are a major}} {{class of}} receptors used by cells to {{interact}} with other cells and with the extracellular matrix (Ruoslahti, 1991; Hynes, 1992). <b>Integrins</b> are comprised of noncovalently linked � and � chains that can associate in various combinations and thus determine the ligand-binding specificities of the intact heterodimer (Hynes, 1992; Loftus et al., 1994). A number of ECM proteins including fibronectin, collagens, laminins, and vitronectin are ligands for various <b>integrins.</b> The binding of <b>integrins</b> to insoluble arrays of these proteins serves to anchor cells at specialized sites of cell–matrix adhesion termed focal contacts (Burridge et al., 1988).

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{neurobiology}} of <b>integrins,</b> pathophysiological roles of <b>integrins</b> in neuroplasticity and nervous system disorders, and therapeutic implications of <b>integrins</b> as potential drug targets and possible delivery pathways. Neuroplasticity is a central phenomenon in many neurological conditions such as seizures, trauma, and traumatic brain injury. During the course of many brain diseases, in addition to intracellular compartment changes, alterations in non-cell compartments such as extracellular matrix (ECM) are recognized as an essential process in forming and reorganizing neural connections. <b>Integrins</b> are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate cell–ECM and cell–cell adhesion events. Although the mechanisms of neuroplasticity remain unclear, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>integrins</b> undergo plasticity including clustering through interactions with ECM proteins, modulating ion channels, intracellular Ca 2 + and protein kinases signaling, and reorganization of cytoskeletal filaments. As cell surface receptors, <b>integrins</b> are central to the pathophysiology of many brain diseases, such as epilepsy, and are potential targets for the development of new drugs for neurological disorders...|$|R
40|$|The arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) -binding <b>integrins</b> αvβ 6 and αvβ 8 {{activate}} latent TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 3 in vivo, but it {{is uncertain}} whether other RGD-binding <b>integrins</b> such as <b>integrins</b> αvβ 5 and αvβ 3 activate these TGFβ isoforms. To define the combined role of αvβ 6 - and αvβ 8 -integrin in TGFβ activation, we analyzed mice lacking function of both <b>integrins</b> by means of gene deletion and/or pharmacologic inhibition. Most Itgb 6 –/–;Itgb 8 –/– embryos die at mid-gestation; those that survive develop cleft palate–as observed in Tgfb 3 –/– mice. Itgb 8 –/– mice treated with an anti-αvβ 6 -integrin antibody develop severe autoimmunity and lack Langerhans cells–similar to Tgfb 1 -null mice. These results support a model in which TGFβ 3 -mediated palate fusion and TGFβ 1 -mediated suppression of autoimmunity and generation of Langerhans cells require <b>integrins</b> αvβ 6 and αvβ 8 but not other RGD-binding <b>integrins</b> as TGFβ activators...|$|R

25|$|Leukocyte {{adhesion}} deficiency (LAD) is {{a genetic}} disease {{associated with a}} defect in the leukocyte extravasation process, caused by a defective <b>integrin</b> β2 chain (found in LFA-1 and Mac-1).

40|$|One of the {{important}} factors in controlling the dynamics, structure, and functioning of the cell membrane is the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins and lipids. <b>Integrins</b> {{are one of the}} ubiquitous transmembrane proteins that are vital for numerous cellular functions. <b>Integrins</b> 2 ̆ 7 lateral mobility and rearrangement is essential for <b>integrins</b> primary function of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, cell-cell adhesion, and signaling. Lateral movement allows <b>integrins</b> to associate with extracellular ligand and other cytoplasmic and membrane proteins to incite biological activity such as signaling and downstream effects. This thesis describes the role of both downstream and upstream effectors, such as extracellular ligand, selected cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in altering <b>integrins</b> 2 ̆ 7 lateral dynamics in the cell membrane. <b>Integrins</b> 2 ̆ 7 lateral mobility is studied using two popular fluorescence techniques: single particle tracking (SPT) with ligand-functionalized quantum dots (QDs) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with integrin-Venus fusion proteins. The molecular biology technique called RNA interference (RNAi) is used to selectively reduce the expression of a protein of interest in the cell. The results prove that the ligand binding affinity, selected cytoplasmic and membrane proteins do affect lateral mobility of a subset of <b>integrins...</b>|$|R

25|$|Acting {{through several}} integrins and {{probably}} a few yet unknown other receptors Thy-1 mediates adhesion of leukocytes and monocytes to endothelial cells and fibroblasts, melanoma cells to endothelium, and thymocytes to thymic epithelium.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, chemokines {{released}} by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface <b>integrin</b> molecules {{to switch from}} the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the activated state, integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This causes the immobilisation of the leukocytes, despite the sheer forces of the ongoing blood flow.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{gain access}} to {{keratinocyte}} stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface. Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial attachment of the virus. The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 <b>integrin,</b> and transported to membrane-enclosed vesicles called endosomes. The capsid protein L2 disrupts the membrane of the endosome, allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Integrins</b> work {{alongside}} other receptors such as cadherins, the immunoglobulin superfamily {{cell adhesion}} molecules, selectins and syndecans to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction. Ligands for <b>integrins</b> include fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen and laminin.|$|R

Precursors for both T and B cells require α 4 <b>integrins</b> for normal development within the bone marrow. In contrast, monocytes and natural killer cells can develop normally without α 4 <b>integrins.</b> Thus, there are lymphocyte-specific, developmentally regulated requirements for α 4 <b>integrins</b> in hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.

40|$|Tumors are stiffer {{than normal}} tissue, and tumors have altered <b>integrins.</b> Because <b>integrins</b> are mechanotransducers that {{regulate}} cell fate, we asked whether tissue stiffness could promote malignant behavior by modulating <b>integrins.</b> We found that tumors are rigid {{because they have}} a stiff stroma and elevated Rho-dependent cytoskeletal tension that drives focal adhesions, disrupts adherens junctions, perturbs tissue polarity, enhances growth, and hinders lumen formation. Matrix stiffness perturbs epithelial morphogenesis by clustering <b>integrins</b> to enhance ERK activation and increase ROCK-generated contractility and focal adhesions. Contractile, EGF-transformed epithelia with elevated ERK and Rho activity could be phenotypically reverted to tissues lacking focal adhesions if Rho-generated contractility or ERK activity was decreased. Thus, ERK and Rho constitute part of an integrated mechanoregulatory circuit linking matrix stiffness to cytoskeletal tension through <b>integrins</b> to regulate tissue phenotype...|$|R
