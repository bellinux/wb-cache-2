50|$|This {{section of}} the Brisbane Valley Rail Line was built under the 1895 Railways Guarantee Act which {{provided}} for local authorities to request construction of a railway by guaranteeing to meet any losses and the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> <b>borrowed</b> for construction. The Railways Department was also required to share any deficit equally with the guarantors. The guarantee ended after 14 years unless a profit was made for three consecutive years, at which time it ceased. The cost to the residents in the benefited area served by the rail line including the Harlin Bridge in the financial year 1913-1914 was £3389. Of this amount the Esk Shire Council paid £2000, Crow's Nest Shire Council £194, Nanango Shire Council £490 and Treasury £705. The nett revenue of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line was positive until the 1917-18 financial year after which the line experienced a period of losses until 1932 following which it again returned substantial nett revenues.|$|E

40|$|A multi year {{financial}} {{model was}} used to evaluate the economics of contract finishing of hogs. The model includes projected income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, as well as the calculation of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) using discounted after tax cash flows. The model uses contract fees and incentive schemes, and the evaluation of manure and how much of it can be captured as income. It uses depreciation <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> investment (which affects the amount of income taxes paid), <b>interest</b> costs <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital,</b> labor, utilities, insurance, maintenance, property taxes, and the cost of spreading the manure as expenses. The effect of an injection of patient capital was also calculated. The calculations were done for a 20 year period, from the time the facility is built and stocked with hogs {{to the end of the}} serviceable life of the barn. The results indicate that there are at least three conditions within the barn enterprise that have to be met in order for it to become economically viable. The first condition is the life of the contract. If the barn has a serviceable life of 20 years, it must be full of pigs for all or most of that time to generate competitive rates of return. The second condition is the capture of the nutrient value of the manure. The hog owners have not been able to capture the nutrient value of the manure because they don’t usually own the land surrounding their enterprises, that is to say stand alone barns have not bee...|$|R
40|$|Companies financed through <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital</b> {{are allowed}} a tax {{deduction}} for the costs re-lated to their <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> A similar tax relief for companies financed through share-holder’s equity does not exist, why these companies are taxed higher than companies fi-nanced by <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> The result {{is that there is}} an asymmetric tax treatment of companies depending on how they are financed. The autumn of 2012, the Swedish government presents a proposal for an investor deduc-tion which seeks to equalize the above mentioned asymmetry. The proposed investor de-duction is a tax relief for investments in shares in a startup- or small company equal to 50 percent of the acquisition cost of that investment. The venture capital deduction, which in this thesis is treated {{as an alternative to the}} inves-tor deduction, is an interest-free tax credit which significate that two-thirds of the acquisi-tion cost is deductible from taxation at the time of the acquisition. Another alternative is the UK's Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), which offers a package of tax reliefs that becomes applicable when an individual invests in a company for example a tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of acquisition. A final option is the Notional Interest Deduction (NID) which is {{a tax deduction}} for companies regarding a fictitious <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> equity. Of these models, only the NID deduction equalizes the tax asymmetry, because of that it is a relief that is comparable to the tax credit deduction for <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> However entails all models, except the venture capital deduction, to make external capital more accessible by reducing the external investor's required rate of return by allowing a permanent tax relief.

Issues such as higher than expected building period, building cost and <b>interest</b> charged <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital</b> hinder this noble idea. Policies of various arms of government in Nigeria had been unstable over the years due to frequent changes in the polity. The main objectives of this paper was to assess the acceptability of the National housing fund programme by the populace {{from the point of view}} of their participation, and evaluate the impact of the scheme on real estate development activities in the country as a whole. At the empirical level, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (Apex Bank), was studied with respect to both the collection of the national housing fund and the granting of mortgage loans to both the primary mortgage institutions and private real estate developers in the country. Current significant bottlenecks in real estate development as identified by primary mortgage institutions and private estate developers in Nigeria were looked into in an attempt at offering workable solutions. The result of this study shows that for the populace to achieve maximum benefits accruable from the sustainability of the national housing fund, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria should enhance its credibility by promptly considering loan applications forwarded. A situation where mortgage loan applications are not considered on time or funds not released to beneficiaries on time, can frustrate individuals. Once this is done, the national housing scheme would assist Nigerians to face the challenges of housing the masses squarely thereby achieving global competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{contributions}} of Karl Marx (1864 - 1875) and Rudolph Hilferding (1810) to corporate finance. Firstly we present Marx’s analysis {{of the division of}} gross profit of joint-stock companies into management fees, <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital,</b> and profit of enterprise. Among the capital assets, Marx places more emphasis on debt contracts whose yields are fixed and develops a monetary analysis of the determination of these yields. Secondly we present Hilferding’s theory of promoter’s profit. This author resumes Marx’s theory but put the emphasis on the securities (shares) of joint-stock companies whose yields, the dividends, are uncertain, and risky. Hilferding introduces the risk premium in the interest rate used to capitalize the profit of enterprise, which gives rise to the promoter’s profit. Promoter’s profit arises from the conversion of profit-bearing capital into dividend-bearing capital. Our topic is not a general study of Marx’s and Hilferding’s writings <b>on</b> value, money, <b>capital,</b> cycle and connections between industrial and banking capital – cf. J. Schumpeter (1954), S. de Brunhoff (1971, 1973), W. A. Darity & B. L. Horn (1985), C. M. Germer (1998), A. Nelson (1999); J. de Boyer (2003), S. Hollander (2008), J. E. King (2010). In particular we do not inquire the continuity or discontinuity between Marx and Hilferding about the determinants of the value of money and of prices of commodities. We restrict our study to the characteristics of joint-stock companies and to the determinants of interest rates, rate of profit <b>on</b> own <b>capital</b> and market valorisation of this <b>capital.</b> <b>On</b> this limited topic, as far as we know, there are relatively few studies in the secondary literature: A. A. Bolbol & M. A. Lovewell (2001), de Boyer, and Hollander already quoted. Following the introduction, section 2 introduces the profit of enterprise and presents the interactions established by Marx between the forces of supply of, and demand for, interest-bearing capital and the distinct motives of the demand for money; i. e. demand for money as a means of purchase, as a means of payment, international and national, or as a means of hoarding. It leads {{to take into account the}} functioning of the money market and to conclude that the “bank rate” policy of the central bank is the key determinant of the <b>interest</b> rates established <b>on</b> the market for interest bearing capital. Section 3 is devoted to Marx’s criticism of both currency and banking schools concerning this “bank rate” policy. Section 4 introduces the analysis of the leverage effect of <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>on</b> the profitability, and riskiness, <b>on</b> own <b>capital</b> as well as, according to Marx, the separation of ownership from management that results from the creation of joint stock companies. Section 5 focuses the equity risk premium and promoter’s profit introduced by Hilferding. Section 6 discusses Hilferding’s results (1910) in the light of Modigliani-Miller theorem (1958) ...|$|R
40|$|In Nebraska, 1989 {{was another}} year of active market {{activity}} and increasing agricultural land values. These {{were two of}} the findings evident from the 1990 Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Survey reports. The 1990 survey revealed a smaller average rate of increase of 9 percent during the 12 -month period ending February 1, 1990 than reported for the year earlier. This smaller increase is a reflection of previous increases in farmland values and some decrease in net farm income during 1989. The crop reporting districts showing the highest average land value change for the 12 -month period were the North and Central Districts with 18 and 17 percent respectively. These increases were fueled by large gains in grazing land values, with cropland values also showing relatively large gains. The greatest portion of buyers again were active farmers, frequently looking to expand existing farm operations. These newly purchased parcels were often within 5 miles of the buyers 2 ̆ 7 residences, implying very geographically-localized markets. The primary reasons for selling farmland in 1989 were estate settlement and retirement/health. Of the actual transactions during the 1989 observed survey reporters, 42 percent were cash sales involving no debt. The incidence of cash sales has decreased gradually over the past 3 years. Mortgage financing has increased slightly in recent years to 47 percent of the transactions reported in 1989. For 1990, reported cash rental rates on cropland either remained relatively stable or were slightly higher than 1989 levels. But the 1990 pasture rents experienced most dramatic increases, especially on an AUM (animal-unit-month) basis. The combination of reduced forage production from dry weather and profitable livestock prices has been the force behind these increases in pasture rents. Rates of return to farmland given by reports is an estimate of the net rate of return that land owners in their area could expect at present real estate values. The percentage rates found for each type of land varies, but for 1990 the estimated rates of return on irrigated land, dryland cropland, and grassland were relatively consistent across regions. Irrigated land showed the highest rate at 7 percent with dryland cropland and grassland following at 6 and 5 percent respectively. These estimated rates of return for 1990 tended to be slightly lower than those of 1989. The expected rate of return from farmland is very especially important when looking to purchase land with <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> One fundamental principle for a sound financial management program is to use debt capital only when the rate of return for the asset matches or exceeds the rate of <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> Judging from the averages reported in the survey, farmland currently will not generate rates of return adequate to justify heavily debt-leveraged acquisitions. Even when the buyer is willing to forgo returns on his/her own equity, the debt serving potential is still constrained. As for future outlook, most survey reporters expected 1990 market activity to be similar to or slightly greater than 1989. Farm real estate conditions seem to dictate stable to slightly increased values for 1990, with the weather being the main determinate of the outcome...|$|R
40|$|The single European {{currency}} has direct (elimination of currency-exchange costs, low <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital,</b> stable nominal {{exchange rates}} between EMU participants) and indirect effects (on real income and growth) on European tourism: • Following {{the introduction of}} the single currency, tourists will no longer be burdened with the costs of currency exchange and therefore feel a positive income effect. Hence, they will have a larger disposable budget, which may result in higher demand for other goods and services. However, besides these positive effects on income, there will also be a shift in demand, with destinations within EMU becoming cheaper relative to those outside EMU. Demand for destinations within the euro zone from outside EMU may tend to increase, although the effects are expected to be fairly insignificant on account of the relative price decline. • The creation of EMU results in a one-time drop of long-term interest rates. In the field of tourism, a lowering of interest rates would grant the small and medium-sized businesses of the hotel and catering sector, many of them highly in debt, some financial breathing space. This might result in more capital spending and an increased competitiveness. • In the field of tourism, the exchange-rate turbulence of the 1990 s have had a noticeable influence on the development of market shares. Owing to {{the introduction of the}} single European currency, shifts of international travel flows under the impact of exchange rate fluctuations will no longer occur in the euro zone. Hence, price-related influences of travel flows within the euro zone will only be due to regional price differences, which are, however, limited to a relatively narrow margin on account of the stability pact. Austrian tourism, in particular, will benefit from the single currency, since soft-currency countries are expected to experience comparatively stronger price increases. Stable exchange rates also eliminate the need for rate hedging, which in turn may induce travel operators to offer their products at lower prices. • The establishment of the European Monetary Union with a single currency and a central monetary policy results in a higher level of efficiency and capital accumulation than can ever be achieved in a situation with different currencies, which in turn generates higher economic growth and stimulates activities in tourism. To assess the effects of the establishment of EMU, a forecasting model designed for international tourism was used; the baseline version of the forecast was compared with the hypothetical case of non-establishment of EMU (simulation version). An attempt was made to identify the effects of EMU by looking at the development of the balance of tourism for the period from 1999 to 2003 relative to GDP. Under the impact of EMU, Austria will achieve an increase of its cumulative balance of tourist travel by 1. 5 percent of GDP and, hence, be among the clear winners of EMU in this respect, besides Germany and France. The biggest hypothetical losses due to the introduction of the single currency will be suffered by Finland and Italy (– 1. 3 percent and – 1. 2 percent of GDP, respectively). In general, an analysis of cumulative balances shows that the hard-currency countries will benefit from EMU, while the soft-currency countries have to expect some losses.
