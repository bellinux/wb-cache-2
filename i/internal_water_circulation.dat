In this process, walls of the crucible are cooled by <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> which {{protect them from the}} corrosion and allow higher temperature of the molten glass. Moreover, a mechanical stirrer and air bubbling system promote a good homogeneity of the melt. This study describes how the air bubbling in the glass is modelled in our simulation and enlightens his important role in the homogenisation of the glass during his elaboration. Air bubbling in liquids as viscous as the glass (viscosity up to 10 Pa. s) is not common and specific models have to be built. Two different models are used, first one is a semi-empirical based model, and the second is a two phase model (VOF) ...|$|E

Siret River Basin level, water resources are in the same situation still occupies an important place in the total resources of the country. Economic and social development requires the provision of additional water requirements, but wich should be used sensibly. Representing the Water resource taken directly from natural sources of surface and ground water, requirement ensures water supply used in various destinations such as population and industrial and agricultural businesses. The water resource is not evenly distributed in time and space. Also, and its use is done unevenly, with maximum requirement periods, medium or low. There are periods when the water requisit are not covered by unarranged direct sources even though technological processes are equipped with <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> systems or connected external to water networks. In order to ensure water requirements in any situation and in any case with deficite hydroclimatic or with maximum requirements of perspective, on the watercourse are realized hydrotechnics works, according complex planning schemes a hydrographical basins. Thus, the water courses have been furnished with accumulations, derivatives and water intakes which now provides full water requirements. In the Siret River Basin, hydrotechnics works were made in correlation with social and economic development, wich in the decade 1980 - 1990 recorded the largest water requirements. Reducing economic activities correlated to reducing water loss from networks distribution but and with modernization of the technological processes, the last two decades have led to significant reductions in water requirements. Under these conditions some hydrotechnic arrangements with main water alimentation role, have changed initial functions or {{are in the process of}} redevelopment to become profitable and maintain aquatic and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. In this paper we present some aspects regarding the trends of evolution water requirements and Facilities and hydrotechnic structures with role by water alimentation of the users from the Siret River Basin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Gas {{removal from}} the {{papermaking}} process {{is currently a}} standard practice, whereas purification of the <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> has become common only recently. Both unit processes have progressed greatly during recent decades and new concepts are constantly being developed. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the efficiency and applicability of a channel flow design introduced by Metso for passive white water deaeration and to study the dynamics of passive bubbly gas removal. In addition, separation of the detrimental process water components by selective flotation during deaeration was studied to add further functionality to the channel flow design. Turbulent mixing at the flow discharge and the consequent air entrainment were seen to limit the gas separation efficiency. Also, the properties of different white waters notably affect their deaeration through viscous forces, the concentration of surface active components and bubble-particle interactions. Thus similar levels of gas separation cannot be achieved with all process waters. The analysis showed that the drag of small microbubbles is mostly caused by hydrophobic contamination and the dispersed particles that readily attach to the bubbles. Correlations were derived based on experimental data to provide new information on the drag force experienced by small bubbles in white waters. Chemically unaided flotation of white water in the channel flow was shown to be efficient in separating hydrophobic contaminants that have adverse effects on paper machine production and product quality. Both good reductions in contaminant content and high selectivity in their removal were achieved. Channel flow with an overflow can be considered well suited for {{the first stage of}} froth separation, while further treatment of the channel flow reject may consist of a secondary flotation or other process that enables the recirculation of fines and fillers. Although a certain level of losses of fines and fillers must be expected, substantial fraction of these solid components can be returned to the process stream. The proposed multifunctional process, channel flow deaeration and frothing of white water, was seen to be straightforward, economical and feasible while also providing benefits in terms of total process efficiency that are not delivered by any current process scheme. The experimental parameters presented here regarding bubble dynamics and flotation efficiency can be used to achieve better models of these processes...|$|E

40|$|Different {{types of}} land use are usually present in the areas {{adjacent}} to many shallow karst cavities. Over time, the increasing amount of potentially harmful matter and energy, of mainly anthropic origin or influence, that reaches {{the interior of a}} shallow karst cavity can modify the hypogeal ecosystem and increase the risk of damage to the Palaeolithic rock art often preserved within the cavity. This study proposes a new Protected Area status based on the geological processes that control these matter and energy fluxes into the Altamira cave karst system. Analysis of the geological characteristics of the shallow karst system shows that direct and lateral infiltration, <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> <b>circulation,</b> ventilation, gas exchange and transmission of vibrations are the processes that control these matter and energy fluxes into the cave. This study applies a comprehensive methodological approach based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to establish the area of influence of each transfer process. The stratigraphic and structural characteristics of the interior of the cave were determined using 3 D Laser Scanning topography combined with classical field work, data gathering, cartography and a porosity–permeability analysis of host rock samples. As a result, it was possible to determine the hydrogeological behavior of the cave. In addition, by mapping and modeling the surface parameters it was possible to identify the main features restricting hydrological behavior and hence direct and lateral infiltration into the cave. These surface parameters included the shape of the drainage network and a geomorphological and structural characterization via digital terrain models. Geological and geomorphological maps and models integrated into the GIS environment defined the areas involved in gas exchange and ventilation processes. Likewise, areas that could potentially transmit vibrations directly into the cave were identified. This study shows {{that it is possible to}} define a Protected Area by quantifying the area of influence related to each transfer process. The combined maximum area of influence of all the processes will result in the new Protected Area. This area will thus encompass all the processes that account for most of the matter and energy carried into the cave and will fulfill the criteria used to define the Protected Area. This methodology is based on the spatial quantification of processes and entities of geological origin and can therefore be applied to any shallow karst system that requires protection.
