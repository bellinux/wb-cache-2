5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range <b>from</b> <b>pain</b> in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E

40|$|Background: Besides chronic fatigue, {{patients}} with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have debilitating widespread <b>pain.</b> Yet <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS is often ignored by clinicians and researchers. Objectives: To examine whether pain is a unique feature of CFS, or does it share the same underlying mechanisms as other CFS symptoms? Second, it is examined whether effective treatments for <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS are currently available. Study Design: Narrative review covering the scientific literature up through December 2011. Setting: Several universities. Results: From the available literature, it is concluded that musculoskeletal factors are unlikely to account for <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS. <b>Pain</b> {{seems to be one}} out of many symptoms related to central sensitization from CFS. This idea is supported by the findings of generalized hyperalgesia (including widespread increased responsiveness to painful stimuli) and dysfunctional endogenous analgesia in response to noxious thermal stimuli. Pain catastrophizing and depression partly account for <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS. <b>Pain</b> increases during exercise is probably {{due to the lack of}} endogenous analgesia and activation of several genes in response to exercise in CFS. There is currently no evidence in support for the efficacy of complementary medicine in the treatment of <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS. Intensive education about the biology of <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS (within the framework of central sensitization) has positive short-term effects for {{patients with}} CFS, and fatigue-targeting cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be effective for <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS as well. Limitations: The role of the deficient hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in relation to <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS, as well as the interactions with immune (dys) functioning require further study. Conclusion: Recent research has increased our understanding of <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> CFS, including its treatment. It is advocated to optimize current CFS treatment protocols by targeting the underlying mechanism for those patients having severe pain...|$|R

25|$|Early {{complications}} include shock, infection, systemic {{inflammatory response}} syndrome, low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and dehydration.

Shallow breathing <b>from</b> <b>pain</b> can lead to lung collapse. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing inflammation. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen to relieve the pressure.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings.

The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born <b>From</b> <b>Pain,</b> as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour.

Through his machinations reign, he was led to suspect his favorite brother, Antigonus—whom he had entrusted with a share in the government, and whom he treated almost as a coregent—of designs against him. When he showed signs of disease, the queen conspired to murder Antigonus. She deceived the king with suggestions that Antigonus was attempting to overthrow him by force. Salome then convinced Antigonus that his king wished to see his new armor, while telling Aristobulus that his brother was coming to kill him. Antigonus was killed by Aristobulus's guards before he could get close to his brother. Days later, Aristobulus died <b>from</b> <b>pain</b> and internal bleeding from an unknown disease, which Jews perceived his death as a sign of God's disgruntlement.

25|$|The Keys to the Kingdom {{are seven}} objects of power {{given to the}} Trustees along with command over their demesnes. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the {{rightful}} owner of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, somewhat <b>from</b> <b>pain</b> but not at all from discomfort. A rightful owner of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, {{the use of a}} Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.|$|E

Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and {{says that he is}} not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu's arm and scrape the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who heard them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to play a game of weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching <b>from</b> <b>pain.</b> When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high. After Hua Tuo's successful operation, Guan Yu allegedly rewards him with a sumptuous banquet, and offers a gift of 100 ounces of gold, but Hua Tuo refuses, saying that a physician's duty is to heal patients and not to make profit. Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, this story of him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme.|$|E

500|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either {{temporary}} or permanent.

Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury, a total loss of sensation and muscle function, or incomplete, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. [...] Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord, the symptoms can vary widely, <b>from</b> <b>pain</b> or numbness to paralysis to incontinence. [...] The prognosis also ranges widely, from full recovery in rare cases to permanent tetraplegia (also called quadriplegia) in [...] injuries {{at the level of the}} neck, and paraplegia in lower injuries. Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy, pressure sores, infections, and respiratory problems.|$|E
