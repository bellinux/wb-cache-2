50|$|The DEAH and SKI {{families}} have had proteins {{that have been}} identified {{to be related to}} the <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> family. These two relatives have a few particularly unique motifs that are conserved within their own family. <b>DEAD</b> <b>box,</b> DEAH, and the SKI families are all referred to as DExD/H proteins. They are all quite distinct from one another and there is not one protein that belongs to more than one of these families. It is thought that each family has a specific role in RNA metabolism, for example both <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> and DEAH box proteins NTPase activities become stimulated by RNA, but <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> proteins use ATP and DEAH does not.|$|E

50|$|The eIF4A {{translation}} {{initiation factor}} {{was the first}} <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> protein {{found to have a}} RNA dependent ATPase activity. It has been proposed that this abundant protein helps in unwinding the secondary structure in the 5'-untranslated region. This can inhibit the scanning process of the small ribosomal subunit, if not unwound. Ded1 is another <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> protein that is also needed for translation initiation, but its exact role in this process is still obscure. Vasa, a <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> protein highly related to Ded1 plays a part in translation initiation by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> protein family. <b>DEAD</b> <b>box</b> proteins, {{characterized}} by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases.

Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear matrix protein.

50|$|By 1996, the slasher {{film was}} pretty much a fad of the 1980s that had not {{translated}} to the 1990s. The subgenre's surprising resurrection with Scream was proof that the slasher film, like many of its iconic villains, refused to stay <b>dead.</b> A <b>box</b> office smash {{at the tail end}} of 1996, Scream skillfully juggled the postmodern humor found in Quentin Tarantino's landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994) with visceral horror. The film played on nostalgia for those who had frequented theaters during the slasher's Golden Age, yet also appealed to a younger audience who saw their contemporary stars menaced and terrorized by homicidal maniacs for the first time. In a decade where pop culture was cannibalizing itself, Scream exploited this and worked as a straightforward slasher whodunit.|$|R
