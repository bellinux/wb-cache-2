50|$|In {{more recent}} times, the Nieuport 28 {{has become a}} {{favorite}} subject for homebuilders wishing to recreate a World War 1 fighter, as its wood construction (some replicas substitute a metal tube <b>fuselage),</b> <b>light</b> weight and availability of modern engines such as the Rotec R3600 nine cylinder radial, have led to number of replicas being offered as kits., a number of home-built replicas have taken to the air.|$|R
50|$|The Sikorsky S-75 was {{developed}} under the US Army's Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP), {{the goal of}} which was the development of an all-composite helicopter <b>fuselage,</b> <b>lighter</b> and less costly to build than predominantly metal airframes in support of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. In February 1981, contracts were awarded to Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter, with Bell submitting its Model D292. The S-75 flew {{for the first time in}} July 1984.|$|R
50|$|Many Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers carried {{anti-flash}} white without insignia on {{the under}} {{side of the}} <b>fuselage</b> with <b>light</b> silver-gray or natural metal (later light camouflage) on the upper surfaces.|$|R
50|$|A bizarre Reebok Scheme was {{temporarily}} applied to some aircraft but was quickly decided against. In the late 1980s, the company {{decided to return}} to its roots with the reintroduction of the Harper and George/Cars and Concepts/Halston Ultra Color Scheme. A slightly modified Alexander Girard Sky Font was used in place of the Cars and Concepts Braniff Script. For Braniff's new Airbus A320-231 aircraft a unique Braniff Billboard Scheme was applied that featured a White Upper <b>Fuselage,</b> <b>Light</b> Blue Lower <b>Fuselage,</b> and massive Red, Purple, or Grey Braniff lettering down {{the entire length of the}} aircraft body. The lettering was a modified Girard Sky Font.|$|R
50|$|Peru {{purchased}} seven aircraft for the Peruvian Air Force, with deliveries {{completed in}} May 1939. In Peruvian service, these aircraft were fitted with bomb racks under the <b>fuselage</b> for <b>light</b> bombs. The Peruvian NA-50s {{took part in}} the Ecuadorian-Peruvian war of July 1941, supporting Army of Peru ground forces.|$|R
50|$|The Bell D-292 was {{developed}} under the US Army's Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP), {{which was a}} project to develop an all-composite helicopter <b>fuselage,</b> considerably <b>lighter</b> and less costly to build than predominantly metal airframes, {{in support of the}} LHX program. In February 1981, contracts were awarded to Sikorsky and Bell Helicopters, with Sikorsky submitting the S-75. Both companies were to build three airframes, one tool-proof version, one static-test version and a flight-test vehicle.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{unpowered}} variants, the DG-800S and DG-808S, aimed at competition flying. These pure glider variants have a shorter and <b>lighter</b> <b>fuselage</b> {{built in the}} moulds of the DG-600 and allow {{a broader range of}} wing loadings.|$|R
5|$|Five Belfast-built 302s {{modified}} for longer-range {{but with}} limited takeoff weight due to thinner <b>fuselage</b> skin and <b>lighter</b> landing gear. Originally ordered by Capital Airlines which were cancelled {{and then for}} Northeast Airlines which also cancelled. All modified to other variants.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuselage</b> was a <b>light</b> alloy {{semi-monocoque}} with a nose-mounted 65 hp (48 kW) Continental A65 {{flat-four engine}} driving a fixed pitch, two-blade propeller. The single-seat cockpit placed the pilot over the wing under a two-piece blown canopy. The Gypsy Hawk had a fixed, unfaired tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
2500|$|The ram air turbine, {{capable of}} {{generating}} 100 kVA, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and {{located in the}} lower surface of the <b>fuselage.</b> In <b>light</b> of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven nickel-cadmium technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems. In late 2015, MSN24 was delivered with [...] lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd’s 4–6 months.|$|R
2500|$|The 747-400's {{airframe}} features {{extended and}} lighter wings than previous 747s, capped by winglets. The winglets {{result in a}} 3 percent increase in long-range cruise, improved takeoff performance, and higher cruise altitudes. The extended wingspan also gains an additional leading edge flap section. When unfurnished, the basic 747-400 <b>fuselage</b> is <b>lighter</b> than preceding models, but when fitted out it is heavier and stronger than previous models. The landing gear uses the same configuration as previous 747s, but with carbon brakes replacing the previous steel ones, and overall weight savings of [...]|$|R
50|$|A third {{model was}} then built, {{this time with}} a {{twin-engine}} configuration. The <b>fuselage</b> was <b>lighter</b> while the two Salmson 60 hp engines were placed at the front {{on either side of the}} fuselage. The blades of the rotors were folded when stationary. The first flight was made by Collin on 15 September 1936 and tests were carried out until the autumn of 1937. However, the results were disappointing, especially in comparison with the prototype Florine II. In 1937, further development stopped. This helicopter was destroyed during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|A new name, Sabena World Airlines, and colours were {{introduced}} for the 1990s. The new livery had an overall white colour {{and the white}} circle tail logo in blue on the fin. A large [...] "Sabena" [...] title covered the <b>fuselage</b> in <b>light</b> blue and the name [...] "Belgian World Airlines" [...] was at times just visible, though the title was also painted on the fuselage in small, clear letters. The 1990s saw further fleet type renewal: the DC-10-30s were replaced with twin-engined Airbus A330 and the Boeing 747s with four-engined Airbus A340.|$|R

50|$|The EM-10 Bielik (white-tailed eagle) is a {{low cost}} Polish {{military}} training aircraft prototype, built by Margański & Mysłowski Zakłady Lotnicze, first flown on 4 June 2003. The single engine aircraft has a composite (mostly carbon fibre) <b>fuselage</b> with a <b>light</b> alloy aft section and the pressurized cockpit is fitted with ejection seats.|$|R
50|$|The Vautour was {{designed}} by Georges Abrial of the Institut Aérotechnique de Saint-Cyr and built by Louis Peyret. Each wing, joined to a centre-section {{on top of the}} <b>fuselage</b> with <b>light</b> dihedral, had a rectangular plan apart from an angled tip and carried a broad chord aileron which filled about 60% of the span. They were of mixed construction with two rectangular section dural spars and plywood ribs. Each wing was braced with a pair of parallel struts, dural tubes enclosed in streamlined, wooden fairings, between the lower fuselage longerons and the wing spars just inside the ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was similar to}} other contemporary airliners, but the construction was mixed. Welded steel {{was used for the}} <b>fuselage</b> structure, with <b>light</b> alloy covering fitted to the nose, underside and rear fuselage, and fabric covering for the fuselage sides and roof. The three-spar wing was also of wooden construction, with plywood skinning. The engines drove three-bladed metal Constant speed propellers.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} to satisfy Air Ministry {{specification}} P.27/32, which was for a single-engined long-range day bomber. The A.W.29 was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane. Its front fuselage was a welded tubular steel structure, and the rear <b>fuselage</b> a monocoque <b>light</b> alloy with an unbraced tailplane, fin and rudder. The conventional landing gear was hydraulically retractable by either an engine-driven or hand pump leaving the tyres partially exposed. The long-chord cowled, nose-mounted engine drove a three-bladed propeller.|$|R
50|$|The {{powerplant}} chosen was a Lorraine-Dietrich 12Fa Courlis with 12 cylinders {{arranged in}} a W configuration. Its maximum output was an impressive 600 h.p. (447 kW) but {{it proved to be}} too heavy for the small and <b>light</b> <b>fuselage,</b> which weighted only 1,100 kg, and caused a dangerous tendency to go into a spin at low speed. This shortcoming could not be eliminated, so the prototype, officially designated I.A.R. C.V. 11/W.8, had finally to be abandoned.|$|R
40|$|Mangled plane {{wreckage}} in a field. The weeds are crushed {{suggesting a}} vehicle had backed {{up to the}} wreckage. There are no other signs of an investigation in the photo. Photograph taken for a newspaper owned by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. Caption: "Crumpled <b>Fuselage</b> of a <b>light</b> airplane that crashed Saturday night lies in a remote pasture between Blanchard and the H. E. Bailey Turnpike. An Oklahoma Jaycee official, his wife and another man, all of Lawton, died in the crash. ...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{engine was}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 18R, a W18 engine with three {{cylinder}} banks separated by 80°, each individually tightly cowled. The cockpit was well behind the wing trailing edge where the upper engine bank cowling merged, unbroken in line, {{into the upper}} fuselage, so the pilot had little forward vision. Structurally the <b>fuselage</b> was a <b>light</b> metal-covered monocoque. The fin had Nieuport's characteristic elliptical profile and the horizontal tail, set low on the fuselage, was a broad oval in plan.|$|R
50|$|In a May 1943 Heinkel factory {{document}} showing possible offensive bombload configurations {{and flight}} consumable (fuel, etc.) weights for the He 277, two differing bomb bay sizes (interior dimensions of 1.5 x 7.5 meters for the He 277's tailwheel version, and 1.75 x 7.0 meters for the tricycle undercarriage version) were considered, {{with the latter}} bomb bay configuration existing within a 1.90 meter width <b>fuselage.</b> The <b>lightest</b> warload of six 500 kg (1,100 lb) SC 500 bombs for each bomb bay configuration, gave the tricycle-geared, 1.9 meter exterior width wider-fuselage version, considering a larger load (12,200 kg/26,895 lb) of fuel, a possible stated maximum range of 11,100 km, equalling the potential range capability of the earlier-designed Me 261, an indicator of {{what could have been}} achieved had the 277 been in full consideration from its beginnings for the Amerika Bomber design competition.|$|R
40|$|A semi-empirical {{theory is}} {{presented}} for {{the estimation of}} aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a steadily rotating (spinning) airplane fuselage, with a particular emphasis on the prediction of its auto-rotational behavior. This approach {{is based on an}} extension of the available analytical methods for high angle of attack and side-slip and then coupling this procedure with strip theory for application to a rotating airplane fuselage. The analysis is applied to the <b>fuselage</b> of a <b>light</b> general aviation airplane and the results are shown to be in fair agreement with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Fuelled by a need {{to reduce}} viscous drag of airframes, {{significant}} advances {{have been made in}} the last decade to design lifting surface geometries with considerable amounts of laminar flow. In contrast to the present understanding of practical limits for natural laminar flow over lifting surfaces, limited experimental results are available examining applicability of natural laminar flow over axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric fuselage shapes at relevantly high length Reynolds numbers. The drag benefits attainable by realizing laminar flow over nonlifting aircraft components such as fuselages and nacelles are shown. A flight experiment to investigate transition location and transition mode over the forward <b>fuselage</b> of a <b>light</b> twin engine propeller driven airplane is examined...|$|R
5000|$|SEALITE: Intended as the {{definitive}} {{version of the}} Seasprite for the LAMPS program. A 'lightweight' design for use on naval destroyers and escort vessels which had helicopter deck loading limits of about 6,000 lb (2,720 kg). Was to utilize the dynamic system of the basic UH-2 helicopter, but with a small, <b>lighter</b> <b>fuselage,</b> new skid landing gear, two Pratt & Whitney (UACL) PT6 (T400-CP-400) turboshaft engines and a three-blade folding rotor with a new rotor hub to keep the maximum gross weight at 7,900 lb (3,583 kg). Planned in three variants, ASW, CMD (Cruise Missile Defense, i.e. anti-ASM), and General Purpose. The company designation for the SEALITE was K-820. Due to post-Vietnam cutbacks, the SH-2F was ultimately procured instead.|$|R
5000|$|The G.50 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} of all-metal construction, with a semi-monocoque <b>fuselage</b> with <b>light</b> alloy skinning, {{while the}} wings had a steel tube centre-section structure with duralumin outer wings and alloy skins. Flaps were fitted to the aircraft's wings {{to improve its}} take-off and landing performance. The powerplant was a single Fiat A.74 R.C.38 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, rated at [...] for take-off and [...] at 3000 m enclosed in a NACA cowling and driving a three-bladed constant speed propeller. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit under a sliding transparent canopy. He was provided with a reflector sight to aim the fighter's armament of two 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns with 300 rounds of ammunition per gun fitted ahead of the cockpit, synchronised to fire through the propeller. The aircraft was fitted with a retractable landing gear, with the mainwheels retracting inwards and a castoring tailwheel. It was the first front line Italian monoplane fighter with a retractable undercarriage, an enclosed cockpit and a constant speed propeller; these improvements gave it a maximum speed that was 33 km/h (21 mph) faster than its contemporary, the Fiat CR.42 biplane.|$|R
50|$|On 25 June 1917, Delling {{transferred}} to the Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Service). He underwent pilot's training at the Bavarian Jastaschule 2 in Furth. Upon graduation, on 16 March 1918 he was posted direct to a fighter squadron, Royal Bavarian Jagdstaffel 34. In accordance with German custom, Delling was allowed to mark his own Albatros D.V, serial numbered D.4483/17. Over the basic silvery white of the <b>fuselage</b> went a <b>light</b> red wash from nose to cockpit, with the same red in a wide band around the fuselage. Wings remained standard five-color lozenge camouflage. The tailplane maintained its stock coloring of green and lavender on top, but the undersides were light blue and the rudder was painted white. Delling is also known to have operated a third or fourth hand Fokker Dr.I triplane, though probably without his personal markings.|$|R
5000|$|The Scorpion is a tandem-seat twinjet {{aircraft}} with an all-composite material <b>fuselage</b> {{designed for}} <b>light</b> attack and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Production costs were minimized by using common commercial {{off the shelf}} technology, manufacturing resources and components developed for Cessna's business jets; such as the flap drive mechanism is from the Cessna Citation XLS and Cessna Citation Mustang, the aileron drive mechanism is from the Citation X. Textron AirLand calls the Scorpion an ISR/strike aircraft, instead of a [...] "light attack" [...] aircraft. The joint venture also states the Scorpion is intended to handle [...] "non-traditional ISR" [...] flights such as those performed by U.S. fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Scorpion is designed to cheaply perform armed reconnaissance using sensors to cruise above 15,000 ft, higher than most ground fire can reach, and still be rugged enough to sustain minimal damage.|$|R
25|$|In November 1916, Pfalz hired Rudolph Gehringer from Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH. As Pfalz’s {{new chief}} engineer, Gehringer {{immediately}} commenced {{work on an}} original fighter design. The resulting D.III emerged in April 1917. Like the Rolands, the D.III used a plywood monocoque fuselage. Two layers of thin plywood strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered {{with a layer of}} fabric, and doped. This Wickelrumpf method gave the <b>fuselage</b> great strength, <b>light</b> weight, and smooth contours compared to conventional construction techniques. However, it also proved to be more labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, fuselages of the Wickelrumpf type proved to be liable to twisting or warping in service, affecting performance as well as causing control problems. This has been attributed to moisture absorption in damp front-line conditions or to the use of insufficiently seasoned wood.|$|R

40|$|A 1 / 5 -scale model {{composite}} <b>fuselage</b> {{concept for}} <b>light</b> aircraft and rotorcraft {{has been developed}} to satisfy structural and flight loads requirements and to satisfy design goals for improved crashworthiness. The 1 / 5 -scale model fuselage consists of a relatively rigid upper section which forms the passenger cabin, a stiff structural floor, and an energy absorbing subfloor {{which is designed to}} limit impact forces during a crash event. The focus of the present paper is to describe the crashworthy evaluation of the fuselage concept through impact testing and finite element simulation using the nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic code, MSC/DYTRAN. The impact design requirement for the scale model fuselage is to achieve and maintain a 125 -g floorlevel acceleration for a 31 ft/s vertical impact onto a rigid surface. This impact requirement corresponds to a 25 -g floor-level acceleration for a geometrically-similar full-scale fuselage section. The energy absorption behavior of two different s [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Its latest livery, {{which was}} first {{introduced}} in October 2004, has, so far, only been applied to the Boeing 737s in the fleet. It is a white <b>fuselage</b> with a <b>light</b> blue belly and engines, with the airline's name above the windows. The [...] "Bahamas" [...] part of the name is in light blue, the [...] "air" [...] part in red. On the tail is the colourful logo of the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. Older liveries are relegated to the Dash 8's, some of which maintained the traditional Bahamian flag colors of black, aquamarine and gold located on the tailfin, including aquamarine and gold stripes on the rearward half of the fuselage since their purchase in the mid-1980s. The newer Dash 8 models remain in solid white livery, yet maintains the Bahamian flag on the tailfin only. All Dash 8's maintain the Bahamasair logo on the top fuselage, near the front doors.|$|R
5000|$|It had a nose-mounted, [...] Lorraine 12E Courlis W-12 engine {{water-cooled}} with a {{honeycomb radiator}} and a Lamblin oil cooler on the fuselage underside. The forward fuselage was ash framed, changing to pine aft. In the engine area {{it was covered}} with aluminium, the central part was fabric covered and the rear plywood skinned. The upper <b>fuselage</b> had a <b>light,</b> rounded wooden decking. There were two, tandem, open cockpits close to each other, with the forward one, from which it was flown, between the trailing edges.The upper edge had a rounded, almost semicircular cut out to improve the pilot's upward view and the lower edges had quadrantal cut-outs at the roots for downward vision. The rear cockpit had provision for a machine gun mounting. The fuselage tapered aft to conventional, unbalanced tail surfaces with a continuously curved tailplane and elevators positioned {{near the top of}} the fuselage. The fin and rudder were also smoothly curved together; the latter extended to the keel and worked in a rounded elevator cut-out.|$|R
