40|$|The {{large scale}} {{integration}} of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) requires sophisticated control techniques for efficient power transfer under faults and/or off-nominal grid conditions. A RES is efficiently integrated to the grid via proper {{control of the}} Grid Side Converter (GSC) by accurately estimating the grid voltage phase angle. Moving Average Filter (MAF) based Phase Lock Loop (PLL) techniques provide reduced complexity, however, they present disadvantages under specific grid fault conditions. The most recent MAF based technique is the EPMAFPLL, which provides improved dynamic response and reduces the phase error under off-nominal <b>grid</b> <b>frequencies.</b> However, the EPMAFPLL presents high phase and frequency overshoot {{at the time of}} fault. Furthermore, inaccurate harmonic mitigation under off-nominal <b>grid</b> <b>frequencies</b> was not investigated in EPMAFPLL. A modified EPMAFPLL (EPMAFPLL Type 2) is proposed in this paper.

Counts can be directly converted into frequency of occurrence or stand percentages by dividing the number of cells that contain a seeded plant by 100.

The main drawback of a comb-filter-based phase-locked loop (CF-PLL) is the slow dynamic response. This paper presents a modified comb-filter-based phase-locked loop (MCF-PLL) by improving the pole-zero pattern of the comb filter, and gives the parameters’ setting method of the controller, based on the discrete model of MCF-PLL. In order to improve the disturbance resistibility of MCF-PLL when the power <b>grid’s</b> <b>frequency</b> changes, this paper proposes a frequency-adaptive modified, comb-filter-based, phase-locked loop (FAMCF-PLL) and its digital implementation scheme. Experimental results show that FAMCF-PLL has good steady-state and dynamic performance under distorted grid conditions.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new synchronization algorithm for grid connection of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) in wind generation system. A stator flux-oriented vector control {{is used for}} the variable speed DFIG operation. By controlling the generator excitation current the amplitude of the stator EMF is adjusted equal to the amplitude of the grid voltage. To set the generator frequency equal to the grid one, the turbine pitch angle controller accelerates the turbine/generator until it reaches the synchronous speed. A slight difference of stator and <b>grid</b> <b>frequencies</b> may cause the large phase difference between the two voltages. To compensate for this phase difference, a PLL algorithm is used. After the synchronization is achieved, the generator is connected to the grid and is controlled to extract the maximum power.
