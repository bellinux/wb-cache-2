40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to understand the optimal size and location for air-inlets within confined spaces such as domestic kitchens for improved ventilation processes. This analysis was carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) factors and comfort levels were used as performance indicators. A model kitchen was constructed including a gas range cooker and an <b>Extraction</b> <b>Hood</b> and the cooking process was simulated. Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) concentration was used as the IAQ indicator to establish efficiency of the ventilation process. The effects of the various air-inlet sizes and locations were determined by observing the performance of the kitchen hood in maintaining the recommended level of CO 2 within the room...|$|E

50|$|Large scale {{cyclones}} {{are used}} in sawmills to remove sawdust from extracted air. Cyclones are also used in oil refineries to separate oils and gases, and in the cement industry as components of kiln preheaters. Cyclones are increasingly used in the household, as the core technology in bagless types of portable vacuum cleaners and central vacuum cleaners. Cyclones are also used in industrial and professional kitchen ventilation for separating the grease from the exhaust air in <b>extraction</b> <b>hoods.</b> Smaller cyclones are used to separate airborne particles for analysis. Some are small enough to be worn clipped to clothing, and are used to separate respirable particles for later analysis.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a case of}} {{hydrogen}} release in a typical research laboratory for the characterisation {{of hydrogen}} solid-state storage materials has been considered. The laboratory is equipped with various testing equipments {{for the assessment of}} hydrogen capacity in materials typically in the 1 to 200 bar pressure range and temperatures up to 500 °C. Hydrogen is delivered at 200 bar by a 50 l gas bottle and a compressor located outside the laboratory. The safety measures directly related to hydrogen hazard consist in a distributed ventilation of the laboratory and air <b>extraction</b> fume <b>hoods</b> located on top of each instrument. Goal of this work is the modelling of hydrogen accidental release in a real laboratory case, in order to provide a more fundamental basis for the laboratory safety design and assist the decision on the number and position of the safety sensors. The computational fluid dynamics code (CFD) ANSYS-CFX has been selected in order to perform the numerical investigations. Two basic accidental release scenarios have been assumed both at 200 bar: a major leak corresponding to a guillotine breaking of the hydrogen distribution line and a smaller leak typical for a not properly tight junction.

40|$|Cooking fumes Ultrafine {{particles}} Number concentration Kitchen hood Fine particles Cooking fumes {{are among}} the most important sources of indoor fine and ultrafine particles. Exposure to ultrafine particles may cause pulmonary inflammation and enhance allergic reactions, especially in susceptible individuals. Limiting particular exposure caused by cooking may be important for these individuals. In this study, the number concentration of sub-micrometer particles and their spread during and after the frying of beefsteak were measured in a kitchen and the neigh-boring room. The kitchen was equipped with a modern <b>extraction</b> <b>hood.</b> The level of particles increased rapidly in the kitchen when frying was started regardless of the use of the hood. The sub-micrometer particles spread rapidly to the neighboring room. In both rooms, the main size fraction of the particles was below 0. 5 mm. Continuing the extraction for 30 min after the end of frying gave a significantly reduced number of particles in all size fractions in the neighboring room...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{extraction}} hoods {{commonly used}} as inlet {{element of the}} local ventilation systems exhibit limited emission capture over moderate distances from {{the source of the}} hazardous emissions. Proposed inclusion of a swirling peripheral jet was found to increase the effective length over which the <b>extraction</b> <b>hood</b> successfully captures harmful fumes. However information on a detailed pattern field of the vortex focused inflow was insufficient thus restricting the potential applications of the method. Approach: The numerical modeling study of the focusing by vortex inflow was accomplished to reveal the implication of the key operating parameters. In addition the visualization technique was applied to confirm the fume capturing features. Results: The simulated overall flow field patterns for an inflow of 10 m sec - 1 value under sets of 0. 5 - 1. 5 swirl numbers and 0 - 21 m sec - 1 outcome velocities of peripheral jet showed the arrangement and contour of the capture stream. Under optimum parameters the capture zone derived from the vector velocity field yielded up to 4 inlet diameters near-axis distance from the extractor entrance. The complimentary observations using laser sheet visualization technique confirmed the enhanced capturing capacity from the mist or smoke sources of emission. Conclusion: Through numerical modeling study the capacity of peripheral vortex shielding to generate the more concentrated exhaust inflow comparing with action of the conventional hood has been elucidated...|$|E
30|$|PG-ECD of {{the iron}} growth {{catalyst}} has been performed according to the method published before with some modifications [14]. All electrochemical experiments {{have been carried out}} in an <b>extraction</b> <b>hood.</b> Formamide (spectrophotometric grade ≥  99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to prepare the plating bath (i.e., electrodeposition solution) and was opened and stored exclusively in an Ar-filled glove box. FeCl 2 was used right after purchase and stored in a desiccator. All the solutions used for PG-ECD were prepared fresh immediately before each experiment, and were not reused afterwards. Plating solution: 0.01  M FeCl 2 / 0.1  M LiClO 4 /formamide (LiClO 4 as supporting electrolyte). The electrolysis cell was a three-electrode beaker cell (10  mL), and deposition was done using a VMP 5 -channel Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Bio Logic). The working electrode (battery grade copper foil, Goodfellow, pre-cleaned with ethanol) was a circular piece (A =  1.539  cm 2) fitted with a copper tape connection and insulated on one face with kapton tape. The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl, in 3  M KCl. The counter electrode was Pt on glass prepared as described in the supporting information file. PG-ECD parameters: current density i = − 1.62  mAcm− 2, time on (T ON): 0.001  s, time off (T OFF): 0.5  s, 500 pulses. After Fe deposition the samples were rinsed with de-ionized water (Millipore Milli-Q system), and acetone to remove the Kapton tape, glue residues, and the contact. Then they were rinsed again with de-ionized water and dried with an air-gun.|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} of welding fumes must be optimised {{in order to}} achieve an improvement in the working conditions for welders and protection from harmful welding fumes. The integrated extractor torches offer a high potential here since these permit extraction directly at the place where the fumes originate and make the laborious handling of an <b>extraction</b> <b>hood</b> unnecessary. In order to allow the further minimisation of the burdens caused by harmful metal oxides arising during welding, a comprehensive investigation of systems already available on the market was conducted within the framework of a research project and an optimised trade-off (compromise) solution was developed from this. For this purpose, the existing systems were initially investigated and assessed with the aid of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation and a special schlieren test bench. On the basis of the specific properties of the systems investigated in each case, it was possible to develop the trade-off solution and to investigate and assess it also using CFD simulations and the schlieren test bench in realistic conditions. Not only the welding fume extraction but also the shielding gas coverage were investigated and assessed in this respect so that the extractor torch system could be optimised in an all-encompassing way. The measurement of the welding fume emissions made it possible to confirm the good results for the trade-off solution and to prove a distinct reduction in the harmful emissions in comparison with other extractor torch variants. Thus, a system which unites a high extraction capacity with good shielding gas coverage and, at the same time, has a compact construction shape is now available. It may not only reduce the dangers for the welder due to harmful welding fumes but also increase the competitiveness of welding plants using local extraction systems and an optimised welding quality...|$|E
40|$|Possible {{connections}} {{have been}} shown between exposure to cooking fumes and adverse health effects, such as lung cancer, rhinitis and reduced lung function. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor the personal exposure to some of the harmful components of cooking fumes during the frying of beefsteak under experimental conditions resembling both domestic and occupational cooking situations, and during real-life occupational cooking. In addition, the aim was to investigate the occurrence of the same components during a variety of frying procedures, i. e. with different frying fats, cooking appliances and kitchen exhaust hoods. The spreading of cooking fumes in the kitchen and neighbouring rooms in private homes was also explored. In a custom-built laboratory kitchen, standardized experiments were performed under conditions similar to the frying of beefsteak in real-life domestic and occupational conditions. Personal sampling was conducted of total particles, high molecular weight aldehydes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ultrafine particles. In addition, stationary measurements of ultrafine and submicrometer particles were performed in the kitchen and in the neighbouring room. Tests were conducted under the use of different frying fats (margarine, soya bean oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil), different types (4 types) and settings (2 levels) of kitchen exhaust hoods and different cooking appliances (gas, electric). In addition, personal sampling of total particles, high molecular weight aldehydes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was conducted in three restaurant kitchens. The studies confirmed the presence of carcinogenic components (higher aldehydes and PAHs) in fumes from Norwegian cooking styles which were collected in the breathing zone of the cook. It was also shown that the fumes spread to neighbouring rooms, and that leaving the kitchen <b>extraction</b> <b>hood</b> on for 30 minutes after the end of frying reduced the spreading significantly. The use of different types and settings of kitchen extraction hoods resulted in different exposure conditions. The choice of frying fat also seemed to affect the concentrations of particulate matter and chemical components produced during the frying of beefsteak, but the studies were not comprehensive enough to recommend preferable fats. In addition, the results indicated that frying on a gas stove caused a higher exposure to some of the hazardous components in cooking fumes than frying on an electric stove. Furthermore, the results suggested that cooking under experimental conditions may give a correct reflection of occupational exposure conditions if numerous repetitions of a very specific and standardized cooking method are performed. The level of total particles and the level of PAHs and higher aldehydes did not covariate, suggesting that the measured levels of particulate matter alone are unsuitable as indicators of the actual health risk inflicted upon persons exposed to cooking fumes. It seems vital to reduce the exposure to cooking fumes as far as possible. In the area of extraction hoods, more research is needed in order to develop optimal systems. Additional studies are required in order to be able to identify relations between exposure to and adverse effects of cooking fumes. Dr. philos. Dr. philos...|$|E
