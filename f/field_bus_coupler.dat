5000|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is {{a device}} {{which is used}} to couple one bus to the other without any {{interruption}} in power supply and without creating hazardous arcs. <b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is a breaker used to couple two busbars in order to perform maintenance on other circuit breakers associatedwith that busbar.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{industrial}} application of UPPAAL, {{in which a}} commercial <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> protocol (AF 100) is modelled and analysed using the tool. During the case study, a number of imperfections in the protocol logic and its implementation are found and their sources are debugged based on abstract models of the protocol; respective improvements have been suggested. In this paper, we shall summarize our experiences {{in dealing with the}} complexity of the protocol using various modelling and abstraction features provided in UPPAAL. As an example, we study the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> of AF 100, which serves as the data link layer of the protocol. 1...|$|R

30|$|It can {{complete}} the redundancy protection functions of 110 kV single set configuration protection, including the redundancy protection of single-ended electrical quantity protection of 110 kV circuits (including reclosing, excluding pilot protection), and 110 kV <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> (<b>bus</b> sectioned) overcurrent protection. Redundancy is unnecessary in case both main protection and backup protection are configured for 110 kV main transformer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> {{configurations}} {{are available}} as non-terminated or internally terminated. If {{two or more}} non-terminated couplers are used on a <b>bus,</b> then the <b>couplers</b> {{at each end of}} the bus must be terminated externally with 78 ohm terminators on the unused bus connections of the end couplers. Alternately, internally single terminated couplers (with or without the non-functional bus connectors) can be supplied.|$|R
50|$|Terminating {{resistors}} {{values of}} 78.7 ohms 2 watt 1% are {{used on the}} MIL-STD-1553 bus. At the two ends of the bus, resistors connect between the positive (high) and negative (low) signal wires either in internally terminated <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> or external connectorized terminators.|$|R
50|$|Actuators {{receive data}} telegrams {{which are then}} {{converted}} into actions. This can include controlling blinds, dimming lights or controlling {{heating and air conditioning}} systems. Actuators are also selected depending on the required application and consist of a <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> and an application module with the corresponding application program.|$|R
50|$|Stubs for RTs, the BC, or BMs, are {{generally}} {{connected to the}} bus through coupling boxes, which may provide a single or multiple stub connections. These provide the required shielding (≥ 75 percent) and, for transformer coupled stubs, contain the coupling transformers and isolation resistors. They have two external connectors through which the bus feeds, and one or more external connectors to which the stub or stubs connect. These stub connectors should not be terminated with matching resistors, but left open circuit when not used, with blanking caps where necessary. One of the bus connectors may be terminated where the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is physically {{at the end of}} the bus cable, i.e. it is not normally considered essential to have a length of bus cable between the last <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> and the termination resistor.|$|R
5000|$|A Pluribus {{consisted}} {{of two or more}} standard 19" [...] electronic equipment racks, each divided into four bays. Each bay contained a backplane bus and an independent power supply. A bay might contain a processor bus, a shared memory bus, or an I/O <b>bus.</b> Custom-built <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> connected the bays to one another so that the processors could reach the shared memory and the I/O devices.|$|R
50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the <b>bus</b> without other <b>couplers.</b> RFI dust caps (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
50|$|The 400 kV {{substation}} interconnects four generator circuits, six feeders, two inter-bus transformers {{and includes}} two <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> switches and one main busbar section. The circuits {{are back to}} back and are arranged with the generator and interbus transformer connections on the power station side and the line entries {{on the opposite side}} of the substation. The current line entries are Bicker Fen-Walpole, Bicker Fen-Spalding North, Keadby 2, High Marnham, Cottam, and Keadby 1.|$|R

50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{specifies}} the transformer {{characteristics and}} turns ratio of 1.4:1 {{with the higher}} turns on the isolation resistor side of the stub. The MIL-STD-1553B also specifies the isolation resistors that are placed in series with each connection to the <b>bus.</b> Normally <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> are available with 1.4:1 transformer ratios and 59 ohm (2 watt 1%) resistors. For special applications, couplers can be supplied with different transformer ratios (e.g., 1:1) and other resistance values (e.g., 54.9 ohms).|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{goal of this}} yet-to-start {{project is}} to {{investigate}} the use of CSP-channels for distributed embedded systems. Common industrial <b>field</b> <b>busses</b> such as CAN, USB etc, interconnect the constituting subsystems. The applications, we want to use as test vehicle, are essentially hard real time. They are taken {{from the field of}} mechatronics (for example, robot control, production machine control, automotive). First, one <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> will be selected, on which the prototype of our CSP channel library will be ported, and an industrial demonstrator will be built. Performance tests will be done, to catch the peculiarities of the <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> in the context of real-time control. Results may necessitate whether adaptation to really real-time behavior of the <b>field</b> <b>bus,</b> as described by might be needed. In {{the second half of the}} project, CSP channels are implemented on the other chosen <b>field</b> <b>busses.</b> After performance tests, we expect to be able to indicate which <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> is best appropriate for a certain application.

40|$|Abstract—The {{current trends}} in service {{consolidation}} over Internet Protocol (IP) also stimulates {{the integration of}} the industrial automation system with the information technology (IT) infrastructure for more efficient information access and more cost-effective production and management. Field buses have been the de facto communication standard in industrial automation, but mostly based on manufacture-specific protocols. Thus, the interoperability between the manufacturer-specific <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems and the external operating environment is the critical factor in enabling the networked industrial automation systems. However, most of the existing <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> integration solutions lack either flexibility or scalability. In this paper, we propose a service-oriented architecture (SOA) based <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> integration architecture (SOAFBIA), where each <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> system is encapsulated with optional interface, manageability interface, and semantic descriptions in a stand format to facilitate interoperability. Moreover, a resource agent is proposed as an enhanced service broker, which implement not only the standard service registry functionality in SOA, but also the resource management functions including admission control, service scheduling, and load balancing.

40|$|In {{process and}} systems engineering, <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems must meet certain conditions. Not only function-related {{properties}} but frequently also safety regulations must be complied with. In hazardous areas of chemical, petrochemical and sewage treatment plants, {{the type of}} protection 'Intrinsic Safety' is frequently used, which is superior to other protection concepts in terms of construction and ease of handling. The manufacturers of measuring and control equipment and the users of equipment in hazardous areas are therefore most interested in advantageously using the type of protection 'Intrinsic Safety' also for <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems. To achieve this, a concept had {{to be worked out}} which allows a simple configuration and interconnection of the different components to be realized as independently as possible of the present state of standardization which is still unstable. The Intrinsic Safety concept for <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems described in this publication is designated as FISCO (<b>Field</b> <b>bus</b> Intrinsically Safe COncept). The parameters for the scope of application of this concept are summarized in tables for the categories 'ib' and 'ia'. In addition, comments are made on the optimization of the <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> system with a view to optimizing, for example, the number of bus-connected devices or the length of the cable.

30|$|It can {{optimize}} and {{supplement the}} backup protection function, including supplementing the tripping failure protection function of 110 kV circuit breaker, adding the accelerated overcurrent protection on low-voltage {{side of the}} main transformer, and shortening the time for fault elimination of backup protection. Also, the simple bus protection functions of 35 kV and 10 kV buses are constructed based on the GOOSE information on the protection starting and operation of each bay. According to circuit breaker operating mode in the substation, one zone of transformer backup protection operation logic is added: if this logic judges that the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> (or <b>bus</b> sectioning) CB is in trip state before protection tripping, the time delay of tripping circuit breakers at both sides of transformer will be shortened.|$|R

A single Datacon <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> supports up to 256 devices on a multidrop RG 62 A/U coaxial cable with up to 33 devices or 2, 000 feet between repeaters or buffered branches.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two {{important}} concerns in decentralized control: (1) communication over <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> and (2) {{the transition from}} a single powerful, centralized controller to many smaller, distributed controllers.
