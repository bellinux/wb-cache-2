5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> dog is cured, {{in that he}} is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
25|$|In {{numerous}} {{cases in}} both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> acid has eaten away {{too much of the}} relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E
25|$|All Religions are One {{comprises}} ten plates, each {{of which}} is roughly 5.4 X 4cm., with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7d and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series.

500|$|Commenting on the combat, Paprocki {{said that}} despite the {{simplified}} combo system, the developers have [...] "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force God of War is known for {{within the confines of}} the [...] platform." [...] Because of the simplified system, situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. [...] However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a [...] "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an autosave feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which [...] "can lead to unbearable frustration." [...] Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and quick time events make the combat [...] "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is [...] "clearly on the combat" [...] and felt that the combat system was [...] "a little shallow". He said <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> abundance of enemies [...] "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".|$|E
2500|$|The couplet sums {{up with a}} {{potential}} answer {{to all of the}} questions that the author was posing throughout the entire sonnet. He says, [...] "thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee" [...] in the first line of the couplet. This is suggesting that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> speaker is saying that if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
2500|$|Church has a four-leafed {{cruciform}} layout, square {{entrance and}} base with a dome covering it. Present-day appearance is undoubtedly {{significantly different from}} the previous, when it was covered with carved stone from the outside, which can still be seen only at the bottom. It was probably [...] decorated with mosaics and frescoes from the inside. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> unskilled master built it entirely spontaneously with no accurate measures and models.|$|E

2500|$|... "That the Lord {{had visited}} his people in giving them bread": {{that he had}} been kind and gracious to the people of Israel, by {{granting}} them plenty of provisions; which might be their happy case after Gideon had vanquished the Midianites, who came yearly, and destroyed and carried off the fruits of the earth, which had caused a famine; see Judges 6:3. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> famine had continued ten years, see [...] nor need this be thought incredible, since there was a famine in Lydia, which lasted eighteen years. Note that [...] "Beth-lehem" [...] means [...] "Bread-house." ...|$|E
2500|$|Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons's {{physical}} comedy {{to that of}} Buster Keaton {{and other}} silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that [...] "You can't teach that." [...] Lorre describes Parsons' [...] "great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as 'inspired'." [...] Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons' performance as [...] "so spot-on, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> character and the actor are the same person." [...] Parsons admits that the work is [...] "more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take. And that's really the fun of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the Massachusetts {{minister}} Phillips Payson preached of the American Revolution that [...] "the {{finger of}} God has indeed been so conspicuous in {{every stage of}} our glorious struggle, that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wonders and miracles performed for Israel of old, were repeated anew for the American Israel, in our day." [...] Payson also likened George III to pharaoh, saying: [...] "The hardness that possessed the heart of Pharaoh of old, seems to have calloused {{the heart of the}} British King; and the madness that drove that ancient tyrant and his hosts into the sea, appears to have possessed the British court and councils." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simon Critchley {{says that}} {{the meaning of the}} couplet is that [...] "if you don't {{reproduce}} you can leave no acceptable audit". He evens compares Sonnet 4 to The Merchant of Venice in which Shakespeare is trying to emphasize themes concerning [...] "increase, contract, abundance, waste, 'niggarding,' or miserliness". This {{can be seen in the}} aforementioned complexities described by Pequigney. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. This idea is reinforced by Joyce Stuphen who says that [...] "In sonnet 4, it is nature that 'calls thee to be gone' and demands the 'acceptable audit'". Therefore, the couplet seems to sum up the complexity of the sonnet with a proclaimed consequence.|$|E
2500|$|Figure #5 and #6 seem to {{be closely}} related. Figure #5 is Oceanus or Neptune whose {{significance}} is often seen as one balancing the scene across from #4 and #7, and also an important onlooker, as he represents the realm of water. [...] Below him is a reclined personification of either Gaia or Italia Turrita. The scholars who see Gaia link her with the cornucopia and the children surrounding her, who may represent seasons. It might be odd that Gaia holds the horn of plenty when <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> horn is not presently producing anything. This supports an argument {{that she is not}} Gaia, but Italia, for historically there was famine at the scene’s event. [...] Also, she wears a bulla, a locket of some sort, around her neck, which, again, would seem odd for Gaia to wear. [...] Either way, the children represent seasons, probably summer and fall, as one of them carries ears of corn.|$|E
