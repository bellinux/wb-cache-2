25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, the nightclub's {{fire alarm}} had activated, and {{although}} there were four possible exits, most people headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> through which they had entered. The ensuing stampede led to a crush in the narrow hallway leading to that exit, quickly blocking the exit completely and resulting in numerous deaths and injuries among the patrons and staff. A total of 462 people were in attendance, even though the club's official licensed capacity was 404. One hundred lost their lives, and {{about half of the}} survivors were injured, either from burns, smoke inhalation, thermal trauma, or trampling. Among those who perished in the fire were Great White's lead guitarist, Ty Longley, and the show's emcee, WHJY DJ Mike [...] "The Doctor" [...] Gonsalves. There is reason to believe that Longley and Gonsalves tried to salvage equipment during the early stage of the fire and lost valuable time to escape before dense, toxic smoke made breathing near impossible at zero visibility. Longley is believed to have initially made it out of the building but then re-entered in an attempt to rescue his guitar. Furthermore, a number of survivors later stated that a bouncer stopped people trying to escape via the stage exit, stating that that door was [...] "for the band only." ...|$|E

50|$|The Travelall range {{underwent}} {{the same}} changes {{as did the}} light trucks, in April 1961. The C-100/C-110 Travelall now rode on a 119 inch chassis. Similar to the Travelall was a four-door panel van, with glazing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> only.|$|R
50|$|All 2017 models {{received}} a second facelift that features new alloy wheel designs, reshaped headlights and a reshaped grill. The new grill and headlights {{come from the}} 75th Anniversary Edition models of 2016, however, without the bronze-painted accents. In addition, all models receive a new 'GRAND CHEROKEE' emblem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} the Rekord P2 {{followed}} the fashion trends of the time, being less ornate than its predecessor, and in consequence being perceived as [...] "less American looking". <b>The</b> <b>front</b> grille was wider and the tail fins almost completely disappeared, although the embellishment of body creases around the rear lights was curiously elaborate. The panoramic screen was gone which made it possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> to be wider, facilitating easier entry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> driver and passengers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he howled, {{and dropped}} back, while Hal, taking {{advantage}} of this stroke of good luck, made another dash <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll git my lantern, an' then we kin {{go after}} them tramps," [...] {{announced}} Elias Lacy; {{and in a moment}} more he reappeared with a smoky lantern and started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "Come on, an' show me where them tramps are," [...] he said, determinedly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the idea}} came to me that I might do a little scratching, and, turning around until my tail was pointed {{straight}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> I kept my hind feet at work till Foxy began to cough and choke {{at a rate that}} made me feel as if I were doing a pretty good job.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{a limited}} (200 units) version of the G500 Cabriolet, commemorating {{the end of the}} G-Class Cabriolet production, with a {{collapsible}} soft top in beige with a draught-stop, beige-coloured tonneau cover, radiator grill in chrome, 5-spoke light-alloy wheels in titanium grey, “Final Edition 200” monogram on the B-pillar, sand-coloured and black designo leather seats, trim on the centre console in [...] "designo" [...] satin-finish light brown poplar wood, leather trim <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> and an AMG performance steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Equipment {{levels were}} high <b>for</b> <b>the</b> price. Initially, Renault sold the R16 {{with just a}} 1.4 L {{gasoline}} engine in GL specification for which [...] was claimed; in March 1968 there appeared at the Geneva Motor Show the 1.6 L I4 TS which could top 100 mi/h km/h. An automatic transmission version, designated the Renault 16 TA, was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show early in 1969. The top-line model was the TX, launched at the Paris Motor Show in October 1973, featuring a 5-speed manual transmission. Equipment included power windows <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and central door locking, {{one of the first}} family cars in Europe to feature such equipment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just came}} from the library. I left a pair of skates in the gym., and I {{was going to get}} them. I've been in the library for half an hour," [...] went on the dude of the school. [...] "It's an outrage the way you've treated me. I am going to report it to Doctor Clay." [...] And he started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the school.|$|E
60|$|After {{turning over}} many plans, {{they decided that}} the {{procession}} should come to Primpton House at the appointed hour, when Captain Parsons would receive it from the triumphal arch at the gate.... When the servant announced that the function was ready to begin, an announcement emphasised by the discordant notes of the brass band, Mary hurriedly explained to James {{what was expected of}} him, and they all made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|I didn't wait to {{hear any}} more. Things were getting too hot. I sneaked softly out of my bush and raced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> I sprinted {{up to my room}} and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel. And then I found I hadn't the key. It wasn't for the deuce of a time that I recollected I had shifted it to my evening {{trousers}} the night before and must have forgotten to take it out again.|$|E
60|$|Instantly Willie {{dropped his}} irksome labor and slouched lazily toward the machine, the {{occupants}} of which were descending and heading <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Case <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Jeb Case met them before they reached the porch and Willie lolled against a pillar listening eagerly to all that was said.|$|R
50|$|A dual zone {{climate control}} system is {{standard}} and available only on Limited trim designations with a 6-speed fan; the standard air conditioning/heating system has a 4-speed fan. Lower trim levels have silver metallic trim on the interior door panels and dashboard, with woodgrain on Limited vehicles. An optional LED accessory lighting package in blue can be installed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> passenger footwells and a matching illuminated sill panel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> Oddly, <b>the</b> North American version has exposed cupholders without a retractable cover, whereas international versions have a retractable cover <b>for</b> <b>the</b> console installed cupholders. For model year 2011, the 2.5GT received some interior changes, replacing the woodgrain inserts on the doors and dashboard with faux carbon fiber inserts already offered on Legacy models internationally, along with contrasting stitching on the black leather interior, similar to the Japanese version and aluminum cross drilled pedals. XM Satellite Radio is also offered on Premium and Limited trim packages.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2005, Audi {{announced}} a limited edition run of 250 special edition S4 saloon cars, celebrating 25 years of quattro four wheel drive. This exclusive model {{was called the}} Audi S4 25quattro. Available only in the United States, the exterior has unique front and rear bumpers, a carbon fibre boot lip spoiler and lower front splitter, a rear functional red tow hook, and a high gloss Phantom Black painted grille with the [...] "quattro" [...] emblem. 15-spoke DTM alloy wheels, along with optional dealer-fitted 'Audi four-rings' decals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> complete <b>the</b> exterior makeover. Black and grey contrasting interior leathers, along with [...] "quattro" [...] embossed into the Recaro seats, together with a [...] "1 of 250" [...] exclusive quattro gear shift knob <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manual-only gearbox define the interior changes and act as a subtle reminder of the exclusivity that the limited numbers command.|$|R
60|$|Just for {{one brief}} moment the thought {{occurred}} to me to throw myself upon him with my whole weight--which was considerable--and make a wild dash <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> But it was more than probable that I should be intercepted and brought back, after which no doubt I would be an object of suspicion to these rascals and my life would not be worth an hour's purchase. With the young girl's warnings ringing in my ears, I felt that my one chance of safety and of circumventing these criminals lay in my seeming ingenuousness and complete guileless-ness.|$|E
60|$|George {{snatched}} it up, and rushed downstairs. In the sitting-room, all {{was dark and}} silent: there was no fire, no breakfast. George {{said it was a}} wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came home in the evening. Then he dashed on his great-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> The door was not even unbolted. George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy old woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door, and ran out.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{separate}} door opening from the Greshamsbury pew {{out into the}} Greshamsbury grounds, so that the family were not forced into unseemly community with the village multitude in going to and from their prayers; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the church led out into a road which had no connexion with the private path. It was not unusual with Frank and his father to go round, after the service, to the chief entrance, {{so that they might}} speak to their neighbours, and get rid of some of the exclusiveness which was intended for them. On this morning the squire did so; but Frank walked home with his mother and sisters, so that Mary saw no more of him.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the B (or center) pillar on four-door sedans, the pillar is {{typically}} a closed steel structure welded at the bottom to the car's rocker panel and floorpan, {{as well as on the}} top to the roof rail or panel. This pillar provides structural support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's roof panel and is designed <b>for</b> latching <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and mounting <b>the</b> hinges <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rear doors.|$|R
50|$|The manor is a {{rectangular}} building with two side annexes with roof terraces. The facades are richly decorated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period: <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> {{is flanked by}} fluted pilasters and the windows are outlined with fillets and rest on moulded sills on consoles. The window frames are topped with cornices or pediments. Under the hipped slate roof, the eaves are adorned with modillions. On the ground floor, a peristyle runs right {{across the back of}} the manor and extends onto the sides, towards the annexes. This Colonial-style gallery offers fabulous views of the park, the lake and the mountains.|$|R

6000|$|... "I trust not, young sir; she swooned as I {{brought her}} down, but I at once poured some cordial between her lips, {{and when she}} opened her eyes, just before you came down, I assured her that we were all safe, {{and that there was no}} cause for the least fear; thereupon she closed her eyes again, and is, methinks, asleep. When she wakes I shall give her the {{medicine}} that my daughter brought. I trust that she will erelong recover. Her attack was doubtless brought on by the news that we received yesterday of the murder of so many of our countrymen. We had already talked of taking refuge here, but deemed not that there was any pressing need of haste, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> is a very strong one, and could have resisted any attacks long enough to give us ample time to retire here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Everybody made a rush <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> because, of course, a {{stranger}} don't come EVERY year, {{and so he}} lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, {{like it was the}} lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|Father Brown {{was made}} of two men. There {{was a man of}} action, who was as modest as a {{primrose}} and as punctual as a clock; who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it. There was also a man of reflection, who was much simpler but much stronger, who could not easily be stopped; whose thought was always (in the only intelligent sense of the words) free thought. He could not help, even unconsciously, asking himself all the questions that there were to be asked, and answering as many of them as he could; all that went on like his breathing or circulation. But he never consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty; and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested. He was just about to resume his trudge in the twilight, telling himself it was no affair of his, but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories about what the odd noises might mean. Then the grey sky-line brightened into silver, and in the broadening light he realized that he had been to the house which belonged to an Anglo-Indian Major named Putnam; and that the Major had a native cook from Malta who was of his communion. He also began to remember that pistol-shots are sometimes serious things; accompanied with consequences with which he was legitimately concerned. He turned back and went in at the garden gate, making <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} in the morning, after a maddening hour in his own garden {{on the edge of}} the {{retreating}} brook, Midmore went off to confront more damage at Sidney's. The first thing that met him was the pig, snowy white, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> water had washed him out of his new sty, calling on high heaven <b>for</b> breakfast. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> had been forced open, and the flood had registered its own height in a brown dado on the walls. Midmore chased the pig out and called up the stairs.|$|R
5000|$|With {{everyone}} dead {{except for}} Kay, she barricades {{herself in the}} beach house and struggles to stay awake.

6000|$|Slowly he {{made his}} way down into the hall, and slowly he opened <b>for</b> himself <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and escaped from the house on to the gravel drive. There he found his cousin Ned still seated in the phaeton, and slowly driving round <b>the</b> circle in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> hall <b>door.</b> The squire succeeded in gaining such command over his own gait and countenance that his cousin divined nothing of the truth as he clambered up into his seat. But he soon showed his temper. [...] "What the devil have you got the reins in this way for?" ...|$|R
60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street. Of course I turned too, and then I put on steam, and, giving a laugh as I turned around to look at Jone, I charged on, {{intending}} to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what Jone had to say about it; but you may believe, ma'am, that I was amazed when I saw only a little way in front of me the bath-chair stand where we had hired our machines! And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, {{it would be a lot}} better to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, and so I just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E
6000|$|And {{they went}} on talking, but of what Lennan no longer knew, lost in this sudden feeling of sick fear. In the {{presence}} of these 'English Grundys,' so superior to all vulgar sensations, he could not give vent to his alarm; already they viewed him as unsound for having fainted. Then he grasped that there had begun all round him a sort of luxurious speculation on what might have happened to the Stormers. The descent was very nasty; there was a particularly bad traverse. The 'Grundy,' whose collar was not now crumpled, said he did not believe in women climbing. It was one of the signs of the times that he most deplored. The mother of the young 'Grundys' countered him at once: In practice she agreed that they were out of place, but theoretically she could not see why they should not climb. An American standing near threw all into confusion by saying he guessed that it might be liable to develop their understandings. Lennan made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> The moon had just come up over in the South, and exactly under it he could see their mountain. What visions he had then! He saw her lying dead, saw himself climbing down in the moonlight and raising her still-living, but half-frozen, form from some perilous ledge. Even that was almost better than this actuality of not knowing where she was, or what had happened. People passed out into the moonlight, looking curiously at his set face staring so fixedly. One or two asked him if he were anxious, and he answered: [...] "Oh no, thanks!" [...] Soon {{there would have to be}} a search party. How soon? He would, he must be, of it! They should not stop him this time. And suddenly he thought: Ah, it is all because I stayed up there this afternoon talking to that girl, all because I forgot HER! ...|$|E
