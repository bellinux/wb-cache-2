40|$|ABSTRACT: Discussion of {{challenges}} and success criteria of large diameter, long distance on-grade HDD gravity sewer installations {{with a case}} study and trued solutions for design, risk mitigation, communication and configuration management. A contractor’s perspective. In a project that spanned over 5 years from its earliest conception to its final installation, the Fox Hollow Sanitary Sewer HDD HDPE on grade installation {{proved to be an}} example of the need for contractor collaboration from the planning and design phase right through to project closeout. The project was initiated to install 312 m of 660 mm DIPS DR 9 HDPE at a 1. 5 %, grade crossing the Fox Hollow Ravine, a main London traffic artery (Wonderland Rd), passing directly adjacent to a 500 year old Attawandaron Indian Village and terminating in the west slope of Medway Creek / Snake Creek confluence (navigable waters) located in the Medway Valley Heritage Forest. The successful <b>gravity</b> <b>installation</b> would enable the decommissioning of an aged pumping station and support continued growth {{in the northern part of}} the city. Utilization of magnetometer in an installation that was at its termination 21 m below grade and the affects chamber construction staging had on the HDD process are examined and lessons learned are included in this discussion. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{adaptive}} optics assisted, near-infrared VLTI instrument - GRAVITY - for precision narrow-angle astrometry and interferometric phase referenced imaging of faint objects. Precision astrometry and phase-referenced interferometric imaging will realize {{the most advanced}} vision of optical/infrared interferometry with the VLT. Our most ambitious science goal is to study motions within a few times the event horizon size of the Galactic Center massive black hole and to test General Relativity in its strong field limit. We define the science reference cases for GRAVITY and derive the top level requirements for <b>GRAVITY.</b> The <b>installation</b> of the instrument at the VLTI is planned for 2012.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. In this study, the distribution characteristics of C 02, a promising natural refrigerant, were experimentally investigated for a parallel flow evaporator with 10 flat aluminum tubes. The tubes have the length of 1000 mm and each tube has six micro-channels with a diameter of 0. 8 mm. To detect the flow distribution into the tubes, the wall temperatures were measured along the tubes which are heated by flexible electric resistance heating wires. If the mass flow rate in a tube is lower than others, the superheating of the refrigerant would occur earlier in that tube and the corresponding wall temperature become higher. To investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>gravity,</b> three <b>installation</b> positions of the evaporator were considered; vertical headers/ horizontal tubes (case I), horizontal headers/ horizontal tubes (case 2), and horizontal headers/ vertical tubes (case 3). Experimental results showed that case I was most greatly influenced by the gravity. The refrigerant vapor was supposed to be collected at {{the upper part of the}} inlet header because of the gravity. The refrigerant distribution becomes better with the increase of the evaporating temperature and mass flux. ej 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{installing}} tidal energy technology are high, requiring expensive vessels to drill sockets {{in the sea}} bed or to handle gravity based structures of substantial mass, and this impacts on the commercial viability of any proposed marine renewables development. This thesis offers {{a viable alternative to}} socketed or <b>gravity</b> based <b>installations</b> by proposing that the downwards lift force that can be developed from the flow over a hydrofoil can be used to resist the slip and overturning moments applied to a structure by the flow. The fundamental theory of axial and crossflow energy conversion devices is outlined and the current methods of fixing and supporting tidal stream devices are analysed. The origins of tidal stream flows are discussed and the effects of local topography, bathymetry and system resonance are used to explain the significant differences between real tidal behaviour and the ideal of Newton’s equilibrium theory. The idiosyncratic and localised nature of tidal streams is thereby made clear as well as the need for a solid understanding of the resource prior to device design and installation. The principles of classical hydrodynamics and conformal mapping are used in the context of relating theoretical lift and drag functions to low aspect ratio hydrofoils with endplates, and a numerical model of distributed surface pressures around a hydrofoil is demonstrated. Subsequently, the concept is evaluated using two 1 / 7 th scale test devices, one is field tested in a large stream under real flow conditions, and the second in a tow tank under ideal laboratory conditions. The limitations and challenges of model scaling are shown and the semi-empirical Froude method of scaling using residual forces is applied to the towing model. Analysis of the experimental data shows a correlation with normal distribution and extrapolation of the experimental results shows that the Sea Snail can operate with an average lift coefficient of 0. 7 and drag coefficient of 0. 18. Application of the experimental data to the full scale device demonstrates that the Sea Snail principle is not only valid, but is a significant advance on existing installation methodologies.
