5|$|This garment {{instantly}} received significant global media coverage, and {{has been}} cited along with Elizabeth Hurley's black Versace dress {{as one of the}} most high-profile <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> made the designer Versace a household name. In addition, this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace. It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath's Dress of the Year collection, at which point it was described as a key example of the close relationship between fashions, celebrities and publicity. Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015, Lopez still owns the original gown. In 2015, fifteen years since Lopez first wore it, the dress is still inextricably associated with her and Versace.|$|E
25|$|The {{wearing of}} low-cut <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> exposed breasts was {{considered}} more acceptable {{than it is}} today—with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts. Low cut <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common across Europe until the Victorian period, though a woman's bared legs, ankles and shoulders were considered more risqué.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{embarked}} on her career of social reform with energy and determination. Schooling herself in reform issues, {{she found herself}} drawn to the more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon she was wearing the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E

25|$|In many European {{societies}} {{between the}} Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being {{considered to be}} more risqué than exposed breasts. In aristocratic and upper-class circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, {{as a sign of}} beauty, wealth or social position. The bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical Greece that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period. After the French Revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.|$|E
25|$|His {{government}} {{supervised the}} people's lives very closely. Early in his rule, Banda instituted a dress code rooted in his socially conservative predilections. Women {{were not allowed}} to wear see-through clothing, have visible cleavage, trousers, or wear skirts or <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> went above the knee. The only exception to this was at vacation resorts and country clubs, where they could not be seen by the general public. Banda explained that these restrictions were not designed to oppress women, but instill respect and dignity for them. Men's hair had to be no longer than collar length, and foreign visitors at the airport were given mandatory haircuts if necessary. Any man who ventured into public with long hair could also be seized by police and subjected to an involuntary haircut.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed {{breasts were}} common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and {{emulated}} by all classes. Anne of Brittany {{has also been}} painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.|$|E

500|$|Following her conversion, Davis let {{her hair}} grow long, stopped wearing makeup and jewelry, and began wearing skirts and <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> fall below the knee, {{in keeping with}} Apostolic Pentecostal tenets {{regarding}} outward holiness and modest dress. She also held a weekly Bible study for female inmates at the local jail. In an interview in January 2016, Davis said that she believed that [...] "we are living in end times."

500|$|The {{three girls}} all have oval-shaped heads, {{abnormally}} large eyes (inspired by Margaret Keane's art), stubby arms and legs, and lack noses, ears, fingers, necks, and flat feet with toes (McCracken preferred {{them to look}} more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a [...] "realistic" [...] look, meaning fewer body parts were needed). Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup wear <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> match the colors of their eyes with black belts, as well as white tights and black Mary Janes. The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the two Powerpuff Girls' personalities: Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.|$|E
500|$|Foulkes {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "picture-perfect brunette". Since becoming the T-Mobile girl, she is known for the pink summer <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> she wears in most of the ads. [...] She has been styled by Debra LeClair, a stylist at T-Mobile. In August 2011, Sprint Nextel's Virgin Mobile prepaid service referred to T-Mobile and Foulkes with caricature ads featuring a brunette in a pink dress. Two months earlier, Cricket Wireless used negative attack marketing against T-Mobile without referring to Foulkes. Although dresses in the earlier commercials were frequently described as pink, more recent commercials are noted for the use of [...] magenta dresses. T-mobile has a color trademark for the color magenta and markets itself using its corporate colors.|$|E

500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E
500|$|Alice {{debuted in}} Carroll's {{first draft of}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's Adventures Under Ground. Under Ground {{originated}} from stories told to the Liddell sisters during an afternoon on 4 July 1862 while rowing on the Isis with his friend Robinson Duckworth, and on subsequent rowing trips. At the request of ten-year-old Alice Liddell, Carroll wrote down the stories as Alice's Adventures Under Ground, which he completed in February 1864. Under Ground contains thirty-seven illustrations, twenty-seven of which Alice is depicted in. As his drawings of Alice bear little physical resemblance to Alice Liddell, whose given name she shares, {{it has been suggested}} that Alice's younger sister, Edith, might have been his model. He portrays his protagonist as wearing a tunic, in contrast to the tailored <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> the Liddell sisters might have worn. His illustrations drew influence from the Pre-Raphaelite painters Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Arthur Hughes, whose painting Girl with the Liliacs (1863) he visually alluded to in one drawing in Under Ground. He gave the hand-written Alice's Adventures Under Ground to Alice Liddell in November 1864.|$|E
500|$|Anna's costumes in {{the film}} were {{informed}} {{by the research of}} Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials should be used for the costumes. Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated <b>dresses,</b> <b>that</b> allows movements, giving the character a free range of [...] "twirl all she wants" [...] throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are running around in the snow, they have to have petticoats, undergarments, capes, [...] "and they have all these layers and layers of things that are all meticulously designed," [...] Brittney explained.|$|E

Their twisted view of life leads them to treat killing {{as a way of}} [...] "having fun", even treating a bounty hunt as a game of tag. Luki, dressed mostly in black, has a large knife and throws smaller knives. Noki, dressed mostly in pink, has a machine gun.

They refer to Heine and Giovanni as older [...] "brothers", and are afraid of their [...] "mother" [...] Einstürzen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{publicity}} Cassini {{derived from}} his work for Mrs. Kennedy received led women from 18 to 80 to copy the look of simple, geometric dresses in sumptuous fabrics and pillbox hats with an elegant coiffure. Meticulously tailored and featuring oversized buttons and boxy jackets, as well as occasionally dramatic décolletage. Cassini designed a reported 300 outfits for the First Lady, including a much-copied coat made of leopard pelts and a Swiss double satin white gown decorated by a single cocarde which she wore to the Inaugural Gala Ball in 1961. This was Mrs. Kennedy's first official appearance as First Lady Elect. The dress was subsequently {{named one of the}} [...] "50 <b>Dresses</b> <b>that</b> Changed the World" [...] by the Design Museum in England.|$|E

2500|$|The people, and {{especially}} the women, from the New Kingdom are described as highly religious and beautiful in faces and body shapes; less brown than [...] "the other indigenous that we have seen". The women wore white, black and colourful <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> covered their bodies from breast to feet instead of the capes and mantles seen with other natives (Yndias). On their heads they wore garlands (guirnaldas) of cotton, decorated with flowers. The caciques wore hats (...) made of cotton. The wives of the caciques wore a type of kofia on their heads. The climate and daytime is described as roughly the same all year round and {{the architecture of the}} houses as made of wood. The houses of the caciques are located behind various circular posts, described in Epítome as [...] "a labyrinth of Troy". The houses were surrounded by large patios and painted walls.|$|E
2500|$|According to Richie Unterberger, Franklin is [...] "one of {{the giants}} of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged." [...] She has often been {{described}} as a great singer and musician due to [...] "vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience." [...] Franklin's voice has been described as being a [...] "powerful mezzo-soprano voice" [...] and has been praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs. Of describing Franklin's voice as a youngster on her first album, Songs of Faith, released when she was just fourteen, Jerry Wexler explained that Franklin's voice [...] "was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant." [...] Franklin's image went through rapid changes throughout her career. During the 1960s, Franklin was known for wearing bouffant hairdos and extravagant <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> were sometimes embellished with either mink fur or feathers. In the 1970s, embracing her roots, Franklin briefly wore an Afro and the Afrocentric styled clothing admired by her peers. In the mid-1970s, after dropping weight, Franklin began wearing more fitted attire. By the 1980s, she had settled on wearing evening gowns and extravagant dresses.|$|E
2500|$|Beatlemania did not {{of itself}} create the {{apparent}} iconoclasm of the 1960s; however, as one writer put it, [...] "just as Noël Coward and Cole Porter reflected the louche, carefree {{attitude of the}} [...] Twenties, so did the Beatles' music capture the rhythm of breaking free experienced by {{an entire generation of}} people growing up in the Sixties". By the middle of the decade, British pop music had stimulated the fashion boom of what Time called [...] “swinging London”. Associated initially with such [...] "mod" [...] designs as Quant's mini-skirt, this soon embraced a range of essentially Bohemian styles. These included the military and Victorian fashions popularised by stars who frequented boutiques such as Granny Takes a Trip, the [...] "fusion of fashion, art and lifestyle" [...] opened by Nigel Waymouth in the King's Road, Chelsea in January 1966, and, by 1967, the hippie look largely imported from America (although, as noted, London stores such as Biba had, for some time, displayed <b>dresses</b> <b>that</b> drew on Pre-Raphaelite imagery). The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, whose early girl friend, Linda Keith, had, in her late teens, been a bohemian force in West Hampstead, noted on the Stones' return from an American tour in 1967 how quickly hippiedom had transformed the London scene.|$|E
