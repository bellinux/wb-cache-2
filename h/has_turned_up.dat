25|$|The refined nebular {{model was}} {{developed}} {{entirely on the}} basis of observations of the Solar System {{because it was the only}} one known until the mid-1990s. It was not confidently assumed to be widely applicable to other planetary systems, although scientists were anxious to test the nebular model by finding of protoplanetary discs or even planets around other stars. As of August 30, 2013, the discovery of 941 extrasolar planets <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> many surprises, and the nebular model must be revised to account for these discovered planetary systems, or new models considered.|$|E

25|$|The {{quest for}} the Dorian {{invasion}} had begun {{as an attempt to}} explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by Homer and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological evidence will turn up or <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} {{most probably}} {{spent his entire}} life in Amsterdam, only occasionally visiting other cities in connection with his professional activities: {{he was asked to}} inspect organs, give opinions and advice on organ building and restoration, etc. These duties resulted in short visits to Delft, Dordrecht (1614), Enkhuizen, Haarlem (1594), Harderwijk (1608), Middelburg (1603), Nijmegen (1605), Rotterdam (1610), Rhenen (1616), as well as Deventer, his birthplace (1595, 1616). Sweelinck's longest voyage was to Antwerpen in 1604, when he was commissioned by the Amsterdam authorities to buy a harpsichord for the city. No documentary evidence <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> to support the tradition, going back to Mattheson, that Sweelinck visited Venice– perhaps a confusion with his brother, the painter Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink, who did– and similarly {{there is no evidence that}} he ever crossed the English Channel, although copies of his music did such as the pieces included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. His popularity as a composer, performer and teacher increased steadily during his lifetime. Contemporaries nicknamed him Orpheus of Amsterdam and even the city authorities frequently brought important visitors to hear Sweelinck's improvisations.|$|E
500|$|The {{engagement}} of Gopal and Latha is fixed {{and while the}} reception is being held, a young woman arrives, claiming to be Chitra, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal says the woman is an impostor, but she and her uncle produce evidence which convinces even Gopal's police officer friend Kumar. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled. Chitra and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his [...] "wife" [...] <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up.</b> Several days later, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone. In a flashback, when Chitra was ready to leave Gopal, he slapped her. Chitra, suffering from a heart condition, is unable to take the insult of his slap and dies from the shock. Gopal realises that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulates the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricates the necessary {{evidence to show that}} Chitra committed suicide. Thus, Gopal escapes from the charges of murder. Not wishing to continue living in Singapore, he leaves by a ship to India.|$|E

500|$|Rhys forces Erin {{to miss a}} {{class and}} Barber {{revealed}} that Rhys feels no guilt about what he has done. He quipped [...] "His plan is falling into place perfectly. You'll see that Kate later tries to tell Erin what Rhys is up to. But the guy is a charmer {{and is able to}} make Erin believe that Kate is the one with the problem." [...] Rhys manages to convince Erin that Kate is a jealous ex-girlfriend and that he does not want her place on the program. Rhys charms Erin [...] "into his bed", but he is put out when she calls time on their relationship to focus on her studies. Rhys later learns Erin <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> late for surgery and during dinner together, he spills wine on Erin's top. When she turns up at the hospital, she smells of alcohol. Rhys then implies to Karl that she has a drinking problem. Barber explained [...] "Rhys just has to plant the seed of doubt, fake some concern for his colleague, and rumour and innuendo does the rest..." [...] Erin quits the program, giving Rhys the chance to successfully apply for her place.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "The X-Files at its most generic". The two noted that the episode had only one good visual gimmick; the ability for Pinker to walk through walls, which, they argue, was never exploited to its full extent. Ultimately, the two conduced that, [...] "'Trevor' is just a bit too disposable and routine to hold much interest". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C" [...] and wrote that the story [...] "almost works", but that it [...] "focuses {{too much on the}} 'monster' and not enough on Mulder and Scully." [...] He called the finished product [...] "something that has a very manufactured quality to it". Furthermore, he criticized the name of the episode, noting that, since half-way through the episode no one <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> with the name Trevor and the antagonist is obviously motivated by something instead of money, Pinker [...] "must have a son". VanDerWerff did, however, positively compliment the death sequences as well as the corpses, calling the latter [...] "nicely gruesome". In a comparative list between Fringe episodes and The X-Files episodes, UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben named [...] "Trevor" [...] as the least effective [...] "walking through walls" [...] story, being beaten by the Fringe episode [...] "Safe".|$|E

2500|$|A 2007 paper {{published}} in PNAS put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens {{had been introduced}} into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times. These findings were challenged by a later study {{published in}} the same journal, that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative mtDNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin. The origin and dating remains an open issue. [...] Whether or not early Polynesian–American exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacy of such contact <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Yosano Akiko, {{the first}} author to make a modern Japanese {{translation}} of Genji, believed that Murasaki Shikibu had only written chapters 1 to 33, and that chapters 35 to 54 were written by her daughter Daini no Sanmi. Other scholars have also doubted the authorship of chapters 42 to 54 (particularly 44, which contains rare examples of continuity mistakes). According to Royall Tyler's introduction to his English translation of the work, recent computer analysis <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> [...] "statistically significant" [...] discrepancies of style between chapters 4554 and the rest, and also among the early chapters.|$|E

2500|$|O'Nolan, who {{had studied}} German in Dublin, may have spent at least parts of 1933 and 1934 in Germany, namely in Cologne and Bonn, {{although}} details are uncertain and contested. He claimed himself, in 1965, that he [...] "spent many months in the Rhineland and at Bonn drifting away from the strict pursuit of study." [...] So far, no external evidence <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> that would back up this sojourn (or an also anecdotal short-term marriage to one 'Clara Ungerland' from Cologne). In their biography Costello and van de Kamp, discussing the inconclusive evidence, state that [...] "...it must remain a mystery, {{in the absence of}} documented evidence an area of mere speculation, representing in a way the other mysteries of life of Brian O'Nolan that still defy the researcher." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bad Seed, {{published}} in April 1954, {{was a critical}} and commercial success, and introduced Rhoda Penmark, an eight-year-old sociopath and burgeoning serial killer. The novel became an instant bestseller and was widely praised by critics for its use of suspense and horror. James Kelley writes, for The New York Times Book Review, [...] "The Bad Seed scores a direct hit, either as exposition of a problem or {{as a work of}} art. Venturing a prediction and a glance over the shoulder: no more satisfactory novel will be written in 1954 or <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> in recent memory." [...] Although March lived long enough to see the critical praise bestowed upon the novel and hear of its commercial success, he died before the novel's full impact became apparent. It went on to sell more than a million copies, was nominated for the 1955 National Book Award, adapted into a successful and long-running Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson, and was adapted for film twice, in 1956 (directed by Mervyn LeRoy) and in 1985 (directed by Paul Wendkos).|$|E
