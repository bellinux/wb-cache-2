25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end.

25|$|Generally, {{humans can}} live {{normally}} {{with just one}} kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished <b>does</b> <b>one</b> develop chronic kidney disease. Renal replacement therapy, {{in the form of}} dialysis or kidney transplantation, is indicated when the glomerular filtration rate has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Gene therapy {{refers to}} a form of {{treatment}} where a healthy gene is introduced to a patient. This should alleviate the defect caused by a faulty gene or slow the progression of disease. A major obstacle has been the delivery of genes to the appropriate cell, tissue, and organ affected by the disorder. How <b>does</b> <b>one</b> introduce a gene into the potentially trillions of cells which carry the defective copy? This question has been the roadblock between understanding the genetic disorder and correcting the genetic disorder.|$|E

Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, and perhaps it does not apply here. TransGeneration <b>does</b> <b>one</b> thing, and it does it well. It shows the viewer the reality and normality {{of the lives of}} these students and those around them, their family and friends." ...|$|E

500|$|Philosophy of {{mathematics}} {{is concerned with}} the philosophical foundations and implications {{of mathematics}}. The central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and {{what is the nature of}} mathematical propositions. Is asking whether [...] "1+1=2" [...] is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. What does it mean to prove a mathematical theorem and how <b>does</b> <b>one</b> know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} difficulties Pawnee experiences {{during the third}} season were reflective {{of the financial crisis}} facing the nation and much of the world when the episodes were produced. The idea of state auditors visiting Pawnee, and the subsequent government shutdown, were inspired by news reports at the time of a number of states that were considering a shut down of schools, parks and other services due to the global recession. Amy Poehler described one of the early themes of the season as Leslie Knope trying to maintain her optimism about public service in the face of economic cutbacks and cynicism about government: [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>one</b> person work in government and not become cynical? How does someone believe that change could happen without losing faith?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to writers R. M. Koster and Guillermo Sánchez, Spadafora {{returned}} to Panama {{on a bus}} from Costa Rica. After crossing the border, witnesses saw Spadafora removed from the bus by the PDF. His decapitated body was later found showing signs of brutal torture, wrapped in a United States Postal Service mail bag. Noriega was widely believed {{to be responsible for}} the murder, and according to Koster and Sánchez, the U.S. had intelligence implicating Noriega. On the day of Spadafora's arrest, the U.S. National Security Agency monitored a telephone conversation between Noriega and Luis Córdoba, the military commander in Chiriquí province where Spadafora was arrested. During the conversation Córdoba told Noriega, [...] "We have the rabid dog." [...] Noriega responded [...] "And what <b>does</b> <b>one</b> do with a dog that has rabies?" [...] Spadafora's murder badly damaged Noriega's image, both within and outside Panama, and was among the reasons for the U.S. beginning to view Noriega as a liability rather than an asset, despite his ongoing support for U.S. interventions elsewhere.|$|E

Pritam has given many hits, but like his tunes in Life in a... Metro, {{this one will}} be remembered for breaking the monotony in his sound. There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity that makes this album a winner." [...] Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very rarely <b>does</b> <b>one</b> get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; this is one of them. So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Barfi!s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam. He has totally reinvented himself with this album which defies Bollywood norms and boasts of a sound of its own." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Adhyatma Ramayana, while Tara wails {{over the}} death of Vali, Rama preaches to her, saying that the body is ephemeral, while only the soul is eternal; he tells her she should not grieve over the decay of Vali's body. Tara {{questions}} him asking [...] "if the body is destructible, why <b>does</b> <b>one</b> feel pleasure and pain". Rama informs her that due to ahamkara (egoism) the mind is chained in bondage to desires. He declares that Tara will remain untouched by karma and be emancipated from the bondage of life. Having heard his sermon, and because she had been devoted to him in a previous birth, Tara thus becomes free of egoism and undergoes self-realization. This discourse of Rama also appears in Tulsidas's Ramacharitamanasa, but it is curtailed to just two verses and is possibly borrowed from the former text. Rama says that the body is perishable, but the soul is immortal and listening to this, the enlightened Tara bows to Rama and gains the boon of supreme devotion.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Ron tells Chris the changes do not play to his staff's strengths because Jerry only does well in the background, Tom only does well if people are all aware of his activities, and April only does well if people leave her the hell alone. Chris takes in Ron's well-reasoned arguments and they cut a deal where Chris will return everything to the way it was after Ron <b>does</b> <b>one</b> more week of interacting with the public. Nevertheless, Tom is frustrated with the experience and begins to contemplate leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests.|$|E

500|$|Life Begins was {{inspired}} by Bullen's re-evaluation {{of the lives of}} people around him as they approached 40 years old. During a conversation with a friend he realised that three women he knew had had failed marriages {{by the time they reached}} 40. The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire, who had signed an exclusive [...] "golden handcuffs" [...] deal with ITV. Two months after the series was announced, Lancashire left Life Begins, feeling unable to commit to a potentially long-running series. ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin. Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee, who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil (Alexander Armstrong). When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her, she realises that she must begin her life again. Bullen wrote the series with John Forte. The first series was broadcast in 2004. As with Cold Feet, he integrated events from his own life into the storylines; Maggie's father suffers from Alzheimer's disease as <b>does</b> <b>one</b> of Bullen's own relatives. He researched Maggie's travel agency job by spending a week at a travel agents' in Bristol.|$|E
500|$|Shubhangi Khapre of Daily News and Analysis {{noted in}} her article titled Forget {{political}} will, Raj has state support, stated, [...] "Ever since its birth on 9 March 2006, MNS has been nurtured by the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with an ulterior motive of splitting the Shiv Sena. Ironically, the Sena itself was given a 'protected childhood' in the late 1960s by the then Congress {{as a tool to}} war with the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, covertly the administration has provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank. The purpose is to split the 26% [...] Marathi voters in Mumbai, which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena. The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune." [...] She further noted, [...] "Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy: A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters {{on the one hand and}} drive Mumbai’s North Indian community— which was being targeted as [...] "outsiders" [...] by the MNS— to Congress’s lap. North Indians, who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai, constitute a sizeable— and hence decisive— vote bank. Forget political will, it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj. Or else, how <b>does</b> <b>one</b> explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets?" [...] She also said, [...] "(Vilasrao) Deshmukh is no better. He has often said, [...] "My administration will not tolerate divisive forces. Nobody is above the law"." [...] She expressed her views in reference to, Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi signboard on the shops and establishments in the metropolis. [...] "If you don't have political will, then give that message to the people that we can not do anything," [...] Division Bench of Justice J N Patel and K K Tated said dissatisfied about government's inaction against hooliganism of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists. [...] "Why no action has been taken against respondent number six (Raj Thackeray)? Are some people 'untouchable' for you?" [...] Justice Patel asked as government failed to file a proper reply regarding the action taken.|$|E
