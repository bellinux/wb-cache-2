After successful completion of the In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase, additional satellites were launched. On 30 November 2007 the 27 EU transport ministers involved reached an agreement that Galileo should be operational by 2013, but later press releases suggest it was delayed to 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment or SITE was an <b>experimental</b> <b>satellite</b> {{communications}} project {{launched in}} India in 1975, designed jointly by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The project made available informational television programmes to rural India. The main {{objectives of the}} experiment were to educate the poor people of India on various issues via satellite broadcasting, and also to help India gain technical experience {{in the field of}} satellite communications.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) {{provided}} {{assistance of}} $500,000 {{for setting up}} the <b>Experimental</b> <b>Satellite</b> Communications Earth Station (ESCES) at Ahmedabad and nominated the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as the executing agency for this project. The UNDP provided another $1.5million, for setting up a TV studio at Ahmedabad and a TV transmitter at Pij in Kheda district. It also gave assistance for setting up a TV Training Institute to train many of the programme production staff who would join All India Radio to work on SITE. UNESCO was the executing agency for this project. UNICEF contributed to SITE by sponsoring 21 film modules produced by Shyam Benegal, a noted Indian filmmaker. This resulted {{in a lot of}} interaction between filmmakers and folk-artists. Shyam Benegal went on to include many of these artists in his children's feature film Charandas Chor (1975).|$|E

The vehicle carried Technology Experiment Satellite (Indian experimental earth observation satellite), BIRD (German earth observation satellite) and PROBA (<b>experimental</b> <b>satellite</b> from Belgium). This was India's and ISRO's second commercial spaceflight.
