5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him a Christian.|$|E
500|$|While at headquarters, Middleton {{had learned}} that his {{predecessor}} did not get along with Louisiana's governor, Huey P. Long. Middleton was told a few stories about the governor that made him curious <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on him the day after arriving in town. While the meeting {{turned out to be}} somewhat awkward for Major Middleton, it began a friendship between the two men. [...] Governor Long loved LSU, and loved the cadet corps there. When Middleton mentioned to him that the cadet band of just a few dozen members was rather rag-tag, the governor saw to it that the band would grow to 250 members. Governor Long was a showman, and enjoyed parades and fanfare, and would negotiate special fares to get the cadets and band transported to athletic events across the region. [...] Because of the governor's dealings, LSU transformed from a third rate school in 1930 to the largest university in the south by 1936.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wording of}} this clause caused much {{controversy}} {{at the time}} it was first used. When William Henry Harrison died in office, a debate arose over whether the Vice President would become President, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an Acting President. Harrison's Vice President, John Tyler, believed that he had the right to become President. However, many Senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as President, setting a precedent that made it possible for later Vice Presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the President's death. The [...] "Tyler Precedent" [...] established that if the President dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President.|$|E
