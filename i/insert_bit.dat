40|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{technology was}} extended and modified to drill the first well of a subsurface geothermal energy extraction {{system at the}} Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock (HDR) experimental site. Borehole geometries, extremely hard and abrasive granite rock, and high formation temperatures combined to provide a challenging environment for directional drilling tools and instrumentation. Completing {{the first of the}} two-wellbore HDR system resulted in the definition of operation limitations of -many conventional directional drilling tools, instrumentation, and techniques. The successful completion of the first wellbore, Energy Extraction Well No. 2 (EE- 21), to a measured depth of 4. 7 km (15, 300 ft) in granite reservoir rock with a bottomhole temperature of 320 C (610 F) required {{the development of a new}} high-temperature downhole motor and modification of existing wireline-conveyed steering tool systems. Conventional rotary-driven directional assemblies were successfully modified to accommodate the very hard and abrasive rock encountered while drilling nearly 2. 6 km (8, 500 ft) of directional hole to a final inclination of 35 {sup o} from the vertical at the controlled azimuthal orientation. Data were collected to optimize the drilling procedures far the programmed directional drilling of well EE- 3 parallel to, and 370 metres (1, 200 ft) above, Drilling equipment and techniques used in drilling wellbores for extraction of geothermal energy from hot granite were generally similar to those that are standard and common to hydrocarbon drilling practices. However, it was necessary to design some new equipment for this program: some equipment was modified especially for this program and some was operated beyond normal ratings. These tools and procedures met with various degrees of success. Two types of shock subs were developed and tested during this project. However, downhole time was limited, and formations were so varied that analysis of the capabilities of these items is not conclusive. Temperature limits of the tools were exceeded. EE- 2. Commercial drilling and fishing jars were improved during the drilling program. Three-cone, tungsten-carbide <b>insert</b> <b>bit</b> performance with downhole motors was limited by rapid gauge wear.

40|$|Operations Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Aberdeen, Scotland The Vidar Viking {{came under}} {{contract}} on 22 July 2004, when mobilization began in Aberdeen, Scotland. Mobilization in Aberdeen included two major installations: a moonpool {{and a full}} coring/drilling spread. By 26 July, all equipment for the Vidar Viking had arrived, including information technology equipment bound for the Oden. The derrick was load-tested and certified. The Vidar Viking took on {{a full complement of}} fuel at Aberdeen. Test Coring Site: Witch Ground, North Sea The Vidar Viking set sail for Landskrona, Sweden, on 28 July 2004. While the ship was en route, a first test of the drilling equipment was conducted in the Witch Ground area of the North Sea, ~ 8 h steam from Aberdeen. A test borehole was drilled in 152 m water depth to a depth of 37 meters below seafloor (mbsf) using the British Geological Survey's (BGS's) advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel. Cores were obtained with both systems. The APC recovered > 4 m in all runs (maximum = 4. 5 m). The Vidar Viking left the test coring site at 1900 h on 30 July and proceeded to Landskrona. Meanwhile, mobilization of the Oden proceeded at Gothenburg, Sweden, which included loading the laboratory equipment. On the evening of 31 July, the Oden set sail for Tromsø, Norway. Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Landskrona, Sweden The Vidar Viking reached Landskrona on the morning of 1 August 2004. The stern notch, a 100 ton section required by the Vidar Viking when working in ice, and the helideck were installed. The remaining containers were loaded onto the deck, including the core and European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling Science Operator curation containers sent from Bremen, Germany. Other mobilization work continued until the morning of 3 August, when the Vidar Viking departed for Tromsø. Mobilization of Vidar Viking and Oden, Tromsø, Norway The Oden arrived in Tromsø on the evening of 5 August 2004. The Vidar Viking arrived on the morning of 7 August. Two helicopters, required for ice reconnaissance missions, landed on the Oden and were secured. Rendezvous of three Expedition 302 ships Expedition 302 officially began when the Oden left Tromsø, Norway, at 2350 h on 7 August 2004. The Vidar Viking remained in Tromsø for the next 12 h to wait for dynamic positioning spare parts to arrive. The Oden transited to 81 ° 56 'N, 44 ° 59 'E to meet the other two ships in the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) fleet for Expedition 302, the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Vidar Viking, {{at the edge of the}} polar ice pack on 10 August. The fleet entered the ice together with the Sovetskiy Soyuz leading, the Oden following, and the Vidar Viking bringing up the rear. Transit to first site During the transit to the operational area, ice reconnaissance and personnel transfer flights began on 12 August 2004. The fleet made unprecedented headway of 8 – 10 kt in sea ice. The fleet arrived on site at 2350 h on 13 August and began preparations for drilling and operations for maintaining position in sea ice. Preparations for drilling began with clearing ice from the moonpool. Once this was done, a steel skirt was deployed through and below the moonpool to protect the drill string from ice impact below the hull. Once the ice protection skirt was in place, the drill floor and iron roughneck were installed. The drill floor was ready for operations by 0900 h on 15 August. During this time, the fleet's ability to maintain station was tested by positioning the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Oden upstream of the Vidar Viking. The initial stationkeeping tests were successful, and the Fleet Manager gave approval to start drilling operations at 1100 h on 15 August. Site operations Cores were recovered in five holes (Holes M 0002 A, M 0003 A, M 0004 A, M 0004 B, and M 0004 C) (Table T 1). Hole M 0001 A was abandoned after the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was lost. Logging was attempted in two holes and data were collected in Hole M 0004 B. Table T 2 documents the allocation of time, broken down into (1) waiting for better ice conditions, (2) operational breakdown, and (3) drilling operations. Waiting for better ice conditions was labeled "W. " If waiting on ice conditions required pulling pipe and subsequent preparations to begin drilling operations, these times were included in the W category because that time delay was caused by the "waiting for ice" situation. "Breakdown time" is defined as operational time consumed as a result of equipment or mechanical failure. The loss of a BHA, for example, regardless if caused by human error or mechanical failure, necessitated a drill string trip. If the trip time was caused by equipment failure, it was considered as breakdown time "B. " Site M 0001 (SP 2720 on Line AWI 91090) Site M 0001 (shotpoint [SP] 2720 on Line AWI 91090) was reached at 1100 h on 15 August 2004. Later that day during drill string deployment, the high-pressure mud valve on the top drive was damaged. The valve was removed, the rest of the drill string was run, and then the broken valve was replaced. Pipe trips were slowed or stopped intermittently to allow overheated hydraulic fluid in the new drill rig to cool. By 16 August, the drill string was deployed to the seafloor and the first piston corer was deployed at 0600 h. After pumping for 30 min, pressure was not obtained and the piston corer was retrieved without having fired. Damaged seals on the piston corer were replaced. Ice conditions were marginal, and at 0900 h operations were stopped and the drill string was lifted from the seabed. Ice conditions improved by 1400 h, and operations continued. The piston corer was deployed again, and no pressure developed in the drill string. Upon retrieval, the piston corer had not fired. It was suspected that the piston corer had not latched into the BHA. The extended core barrel was then deployed but was not recovered, which indicated that the BHA was lost. At 2000 h, the drill string was tripped to the surface and the BHA and extended core barrel losses were confirmed. Beginning early on 17 August, a new BHA was assembled and lowering of the drill string began. When > 800 m was deployed, the high-pressure mud valve on the swivel was damaged during pipe handling. The drill string was tripped to the surface because the operator did not want to risk leaving the drill string hanging in the water column for an unspecified period of time. After completing the pipe trip, the damage was assessed and the Oden's chief engineer was tasked with manufacturing a new valve using materials from a spare pup joint. As an interim solution, a conventional valve assembly was installed, which restricted operations so that no piston core could be deployed. Ice conditions deteriorated between 0900 and 2200 h, and the time was utilized to move the Vidar Viking to a new position (Hole M 0002 A). Because there were no mud valve spares, the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat began making arrangements for a Swedish Air Force C- 130 airdrop of two new valve parts and one conventional valve assembly. Site M 0002 (SP 2560 on Line AWI- 91090) Based on a strategy developed by the ice management team, the drill string was lowered while drifting onto the location of Site M 0002. By 2200 h on 18 August 2004, this strategy put the Vidar Viking within 190 m of the proposed site. The final positioning was done by icebreaking this short distance to Hole M 0002 A. Once on location at 0820 h, three more drill pipes were added and coring started. Because the mud valve was not yet repaired, the extended core barrel was deployed instead of the APC. A first attempt at coring was unsuccessful, but after adding more pipe and drilling another core run, some core was retrieved. The first core on deck arrived at 1335 h at a water depth of 1209 m. Drilling operations continued throughout the afternoon. The newly fabricated mud valve from the Oden arrived late in the afternoon, and preparations were made for its installation during a wireline trip. The temporary valve was replaced before more drill pipe was added for the next core run. By midnight on 19 August, a depth of 31 mbsf had been reached. Drilling and extended core barrel coring continued until 23 August (Table T 1) when the Fleet Manager ordered the drill pipe to be pulled to 40 mbsf because ice conditions had deteriorated. Permission to continue drilling operations was given midday, and operations continued until 2100 h when the ice conditions forced the termination of Hole M 0002 A at a depth of 271. 69 m. The drill string was tripped to the drill deck during the morning of 24 August. After waiting for ice conditions to change in the afternoon, a transit began at 1930 h to a position from which the Vidar Viking could drift onto location while tripping in the drill string. While we waited for improved ice conditions and operations set up for the next site continued, an air gun seismic survey was run from the Oden to tie Site M 0002 to the next site (Site M 0003). Site M 0003 (SP 2521 on Line AWI- 91090) The Vidar Viking reached the ice-drift position at 2100 h and awaited ice reconnaissance results. The iron roughneck, which had been removed to repair oil leaks, was installed after repairs; the ice protector skirt was lowered; and the drill floor was prepared. At 2300 h, the BHA and drill collars were run. At 0240 h on 25 August 2004, after 400 m of pipe had been deployed, the housing of the iron roughneck cracked and had to be removed for major repairs. Operations resumed at 1400 h using power tongs. The seafloor was reached at ~ 2300 h, and at 0110 h on 26 August, the first APC core was recovered from Hole M 0003 A (Table T 1). A second APC core with a shattered liner was recovered. The third APC core became stuck in the BHA. While trying to release the corer, the wireline parted at the mechanical termination, and it was necessary to pull the string. Hole M 0003 A was terminated at 0440 h. The ice management team conducted ice reconnaissance surveys, reviewed options, and recommended that the fleet move to a location farther west, where a longer-term prediction of relatively good ice could be made. Once the site was selected, the ice team predicted an upstream ice position for the Vidar Viking to start to drift onto the new location. The fleet steamed to the updrift ice position, arriving at 0630 h on 27 August. During this time, wireline termination repair, APC service, and iron roughneck testing and refitting took place. Site M 0004 (SP 3006 [Holes M 0004 A and M 0004 B] and 3004 [Hole M 0004 C] on Line AWI- 91090) At 0755 h on 27 August 2004 during the pipe trip to the seafloor, the high-pressure mud valve was damaged again. The valve was removed, and the remaining string was run to 1150 m depth while the valve was repaired. At 1800 h, the Vidar Viking was on location (Hole M 0004 A). Once on station, the repaired mud valve was installed and the drill string was run to the seabed. At 2230 h, drilling operations in Hole M 0004 A commenced and the hole was advanced by washing ahead to 17 mbsf (Table T 1) before a piston corer was deployed. Shortly after midnight on 28 August 2004, the APC became stuck in the BHA but was freed after ~ 1 h. Once on deck, the plastic liner in the core barrel was found to be shattered and 3. 5 m of the core was stuck in the barrel. In light of these problems with the APC—in particular, the risk of junking the hole again—it was decided to switch to extended core barrel coring. Two extended core barrel cores were recovered to a depth of 30. 5 mbsf followed by washing to 265 mbsf using the <b>insert</b> <b>bit.</b> This decision to wash ahead was made in order to recover sediment deeper than that recovered in Hole M 0002 A. By 2240 h, a depth of 265 mbsf was reached. Extended core barrel coring operations continued for the next 3 days (29 – 31 August), where the hole was advanced at varying rates with good to poor recovery. During this time, the drilling was very slow (e. g., 1 m/h) and recovery in many cores was zero (Cores 302 -M 0004 A- 13 X through 18 X). Different strategies were tried to improve the advance rate. At times, the hole was advanced by washing ahead in an attempt to make faster progress but this strategy was ultimately abandoned after it was found that the washing rate was almost the same as the coring rate. On 31 August from 0200 to 0500 h, for two coring runs in a row no core was recovered. The extended core barrel shoe was switched to a coring shoe for a third attempt at recovery. This coring run cleared a blockage in the bit as evidenced by a large drop in pump pressure. Following this core (with good recovery) and after clearing the blocked bit, core recovery and advancement improved over the next 12 h until basement was reached in Core 302 -M 0004 A- 35 X. Basement penetration was difficult (8 m penetration in 12 h with low core recovery), and a decision was made at 0900 on 1 September to stop coring at a total depth of 428 mbsf and conduct logging in Hole M 0004 A. The logging tools were moved to the rig floor, and the tool string (Formation MicroScanner–Accelerator Porosity Sonde–Natural Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Tool–Scintillation Gamma Ray Tool [FMS-APS-NGT-SGT]) and wireline rig-up proceeded simultaneously. The run into hole commenced at 2130 h. This was done at low speed in order to allow the tools to warm up. Communication with the tool was initially established, and it was lowered to the end of the drill pipe. A computer malfunction caused a communication loss to the tools. The problem was corrected by 0200 h. The tool was powered up, and attempts were made to get the tool to pass through the BHA into the open hole. All efforts failed at the same depth (~ 1366 meters below rig floor [mbrf]); so, while at rest at this depth, the calipers were opened on the FMS to check whether it was free or lodged. The calipers had some movement, which indicated that the tool string was free. The landing ring for the core barrel is the narrowest section of the whole pipe string (95 mm) and lies ~ 6 m above the bit. All the logging tools had been checked through a landing ring dockside in Aberdeen, but there was no hole calibration ring on board that could be used as a second check. Sequentially, four more logging attempts were made. Each time, it was assumed that the logging tools were too large in diameter and the string diameter was further reduced by removing the larger diameter components. The APS bowspring was removed first, followed by the knuckle joint. Finally, only the narrowest velocity-density string was deployed, which failed to clear the bit at the same depth as the previous runs. After the fifth attempt failed, the logging time allocated had been consumed and attempts to log Hole M 0004 A ended at 1045 h on 2 September. After the logging gear was cleared away and the drill string was lifted out of the seabed, preparations were made to start a second hole (Hole M 0004 B) at the site. During preparations, the inner barrel was deployed but did not latch. After an improvised downhole hammer was deployed and worked for 2 h, a short length of core (~ 10 cm of mudstone), which had been partially blocking the BHA, was recovered. By 2030 h on 2 September, the Vidar Viking was at the new position for the next hole (Hole M 0004 B). Coring in Hole M 0004 B started at a depth of 10 mbsf using the extended core barrel because the APC was deemed too risky. After retrieving the first sample, the hole was washed to 20 mbsf for an in situ temperature measurement. The BGS temperature probe was lowered to the base of the hole, pushed into the sediment, and programmed to record the temperature every 5 s. The probe was left to record temperature for 40 min, after which it was retrieved. Plans to wash to a depth of 215 mbsf, core to 230 mbsf, and then wash to 250 mbsf and log were stymied by problems with drilling pressure lines/gauges freezing at – 10 ?C. Because of these problems and the limited time left, the hole was only advanced to a depth of 220 mbsf. Temperature measurements were made at 60 and 100 mbsf. At 0000 h on 4 September, the pipe was pulled to 65 mbsf to prepare for logging. Rigging of the wireline and tool string occurred concurrently, and rig-up of both was completed by 0415 h.

Similarly to previously considered convolutional interleavers, the new interleavers are designed as block interleavers and their performance in different code structures is compared with the interleaver having higher periods and space value of 1. In each comparison, the number of <b>inserted</b> stuff <b>bits</b> {{at the end of each}} data block is considered to be of similar order. Finally, suitable modification to the new interleavers is proposed improving performance for the codes with lower number of stuff bits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel asynchronous CDMA multi-user detector, the block-based MMSE (B-MMSE) multi-user detector, {{in which the}} data stream is segmented into blocks by <b>inserting</b> zero <b>bits</b> and detection takes place block-by-block without compromising the MMSE detection efficiency. The BER performance of the B-MMSE detector is studied {{and the results are}} compared with those of the decorrelating detector. It is shown that the B-MMSE detector offers promising detection efficiency at a much lower implementation complexity, which is linear in the product of number of users and block size, than that of the traditional MMSE detector.

If the horse refuses the bit, the groom should hold the bit against the horse's teeth with his fingers, and insert his left thumb in the horse's jaws. If the horse still refuses, the groom should press the animal's lips against his canine tooth, which should make the horse open his mouth.|$|R

Except for the clock bits - that [...] "x" [...] bit, and the [...] "0" [...] in the [...] "01" [...] code - {{this is the same}} as the FM table, and that is how this code gets its name.

40|$|The {{project has}} seen {{quite a bit}} of {{activity}} in this quarter, highlighted by the fabrication of a <b>bit</b> <b>insert</b> for field testing. In addition: (1) Several alternative process techniques were attempted to prevent bloating, cracking and delamination of FM material that occurs during binder burnout. The approaches included fabrication of FM material by three pass extrusion and warm isostatic pressing of green material, slow and confined burnouts as well as, burnout of thin plate instead of rod stock. Happily, a confined burnout followed by HIPing, produced FM button inserts without bloating or delamination. (2) Four rock <b>bit</b> <b>inserts</b> were produced from FM material and are ready for use on blast hole bits in the field. (3) Six of the project participants from Michigan Technological University, Advanced Ceramic Manufacturing, and The Robbins Group visited the Superior Rock Bit Company in Minnesota and planned the field test of FM inserts...|$|R
40|$|In Part I of {{this series}} of two papers, {{a new way of}} {{constructing}} turbo codes was proposed. The presented algorithm frequently terminates the trellis of the first component encoder by <b>inserting</b> tail <b>bits</b> into the data sequence and can almost arbitrarily change the code rate by changing the number of tails. In addition to the flexibility of the rate change, the theoretical and empirical evaluation of the proposed codes on Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels indicate that in the 'waterfall' region the bit error rate of the terminated codes may be lower than the unmodified code. This is especially the case with correlated fading channels and puncturing...|$|R

This {{is supposed to be}} inserted at 23:59:03, during minute 59 of the hour (during which the timestamp for minute :00 is transmitted), so that the minute markers are all broadcast at the correct times, but for the leap second at the end of December 2016, it was apparently inserted at 23:58:03.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{modification}} of a typical turbo code allowing for adaptive changing of the code rate and signal synchronization properties. The proposed algorithm inserts pilot symbols into the code structure and frequently terminates the first trellis of the turbo encoder by <b>inserting</b> tail <b>bits</b> into the data sequence. By changing {{the length of the}} number of bits between the termination of the trellis, the rate of the code can be almost arbitrarily changed. Moreover, such an approach allows for: constant interleaver length, simpler decoder and improved channel estimation using the properties of turbo codes. We show that the performance of the proposed system is better than the performance of the systems using typical pilot synchronization...|$|R

In order to overcome CFO at the receiver, a new OFDM symbol structure based on extending the transmitted symbol by <b>inserting</b> extra <b>bits</b> at the front of it before transmission is applied in this paper. The proposed method is capable of correcting {{frequency offset}} in the range of multiples of subcarrier spacing depending on the number of added extra bits. This is performed at the expense of transmitted power and data rate due to the insertion of extra bits. Simulation results indicate the performance improvement over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath fading channels...|$|R
