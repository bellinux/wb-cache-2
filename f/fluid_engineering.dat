5000|$|In heavy {{industrial}} or <b>fluid</b> <b>engineering</b> contexts, a {{choke valve}} {{is a particular}} design of valve that raises and lowers a solid cylinder (called a [...] "plug" [...] or [...] "stem") which is placed around or inside another cylinder that has holes or slots. The design of a choke valve means fluids flowing through the cage are coming from all sides and that the streams of flow (through the holes or slots) collide with {{each other at the}} center of the cage cylinder, thereby dissipating the energy of the fluid through [...] "flow impingement". The main advantage of choke valves is that they can be designed to be totally linear in their flow rate.|$|E

The interrelationship between pressure and nozzle diameter as this effects the specific energy of cutting coal is investigated and it is shown t-hat for a given pump horsepower it is more effective to use a large nozzle diameter and accept a lower effective jet pressure than to increase the jet pressure by use of a smaller nozzle.
