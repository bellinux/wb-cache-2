In the part dealing with the solid-state amperometric sensor for NO 2 research was aimed at development of new solid electrolyte. This electrolyte is developed as a system of ionic liquid embedded in the structure of a polymer, when the ionic liquid joints the properties of a solvent and a dissolved salt. The electrolyte therefore does not contain any volatile component and is long-term chemically and electrochemically stable. Several series of electrolytes were prepared with different polymers or macromonomers and imidazolium-based ionic liquids. The composition, especially the polymer-IL ratio was optimized.

40|$|Monitoring organic {{environmental}} contaminants is {{of crucial}} importance to ensure public health. This requires simple, portable and robust devices {{to carry out}} on-site analysis. For this purpose, a low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) microfluidic potentiometric device (LTCC/μPOT) was developed {{for the first time}} for an organic compound: sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Sensory materials relied on newly designed plastic antibodies. Sol–gel, self-assembling monolayer and molecular-imprinting techniques were merged for this purpose. Silica beads were amine-modified and linked to SMX via glutaraldehyde modification. Condensation polymerization was conducted around SMX to fill the vacant spaces. SMX was removed after, leaving behind imprinted sites of complementary shape. The obtained particles were used as ionophores in plasticized PVC membranes. The most suitable membrane composition was selected in steady-state assays. Its suitability to flow analysis was verified in flow-injection studies with regular tubular electrodes. The LTCC/μPOT device integrated a bidimensional mixer, an embedded reference electrode based on Ag/AgCl and an Ag-based contact screen-printed under a micromachined cavity of 600 μm depth. The sensing membranes were deposited over this contact and acted as <b>indicating</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Under optimum conditions, the SMX sensor displayed slopes of about − 58. 7 mV/decade in a range from 12. 7 to 250 μg/mL, providing a detection limit of 3. 85 μg/mL and a sampling throughput of 36 samples/h with a reagent consumption of 3. 3 mL per sample.
