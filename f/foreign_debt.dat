5|$|The era of import {{substitution}} ended in 1976, {{but at the}} same time growing government spending, large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> by the late 1980s, which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay {{a portion of}} the debt of other states if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's total <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, {{the debt}} reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP. This substantial increase {{is attributed to}} effects of regional instability causing: decrease in tourist activity; decreased foreign investments; increased military expenditure; attacks on Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; expenses from hosting Syrian refugees and accumulated interests from loans. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers {{only a small part}} of these costs, 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan. An economic programme was adopted by the government which aims to reduce Jordan's debt-to-GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2021.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval {{arms race}} was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced {{to take out a}} £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationships}} between <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt,</b> macroeconomic volatility, and risk premia in {{a model of a}} small open emerging market economy. The external value of the local currency is counter-cyclical, so that <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt</b> requires larger repayments than local currency debt in bad states of nature. The level of <b>foreign</b> currency-denominated <b>debts,</b> therefore, affects the volatility of aggregate demand and by extension of the exchange rate. Exchange rate volatility is in turn an important determinant of the risk premium on local currency debt. Finally, this risk premium is {{a major factor in the}} choice of local versus foreign currency for emerging market borrowers. The mutual endogeneity of <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt,</b> risk premia, and macroeconomic volatility creates important feedback effects in the economy: small increases in international risk aversion may entail large amplification effects on macroeconomic volatility since domestic borrowers substitute towards cheaper but riskier <b>foreign</b> currency <b>debt</b> finance. <b>Foreign</b> currency <b>debt</b> Volatility Risk premia Amplification...|$|R

5|$|The {{early and}} mid-1980s saw {{economic}} trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's {{largest and most}} expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished {{by the end of}} the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya's <b>foreign</b> <b>debt</b> rose, and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in August 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, most of them Egyptian and Tunisian. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked either to the NFSL or the Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} idea {{of building}} a railway between Norway's two largest cities was launched by Hans Gløersen on 24 August 1871 in Bergensposten. The forest supervisor in Voss suggested building the railway via Voss and Hallingdal {{to connect with the}} Krøderen Line. Back in 1866 the same person had launched the idea of the Jæren Line. Within days of the launch of the Bergen Line the city council had assimilated support for the suggestion. In 1872 the railway director Carl Abraham Pihl and two engineers went on a survey tour to look at the suggested line. At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiative, and that local municipalities and private investors would then pay about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through <b>foreign</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's <b>foreign</b> <b>debt,</b> but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{views the}} problem of {{sovereign}} risk as one of insufficient penalties. Foreign creditors can only be repaid if the government enforces <b>foreign</b> <b>debts.</b> And this will only happen if foreign creditors can effectively use the threat of imposing penalties to the country. Guided by this assessment of the problem, policy prescriptions to reduce sovereign risk have focused on providing incentives for governments to enforce <b>foreign</b> <b>debts.</b> For instance, countries might want to favor increased trade ties {{and other forms of}} foreign dependence that make them vulnerable to foreign retaliation thereby increasing the costs of default penalties.

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's <b>foreign</b> <b>debt,</b> which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
25|$|This {{strategy}} {{was effective in}} promoting growth, but it also raised Brazil's import requirements markedly, increasing the already large current-account deficit.
