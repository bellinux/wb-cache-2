5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|As {{he slowly}} regains his memory, Mike recalls his {{feelings}} for Susan and challenges Ian for her affections. When Susan learns {{that the two}} had made a bet on her {{in a game of}} poker, she calls off the wedding and declares that she does not want to see either of them again. Realizing that letting both of them go <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> Susan decides to take Ian back. However, he tells her that he cannot {{spend the rest of his}} life wondering if she is still in love with Mike, and he leaves. Susan and Mike reunite and become engaged. The couple get married in a private ceremony in the woods, with Julie as their only guest.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} one finale, Shelby adopts Quinn and Puck's newborn daughter, Beth. She leaves Vocal Adrenaline before the {{beginning}} of the next school year. Shelby returns in the second episode of the third season, having been recruited to lead a second glee club at McKinley High by Sugar Motta's father when Sugar is refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. Struggling at being a mother, she forms a romantic bond with eighteen-year-old student Puck, leading to a sexual relationship before she tells him that their relationship <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and resigns from McKinley in the eighth episode. While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.|$|E

5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} also names {{two other}} sons; however, Matheson considered the manuscript {{to be of}} dubious authority, {{since it is the}} only source for these names. It lists Leod's third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. The manuscript continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal man of his name there, his descendants were known not as MacLeods, but as MacElliots. The manuscript states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> since John's daughter couldn't have married later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod's fourth son is listed by the manuscript as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod.|$|E
5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began {{in the second part of}} the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to see Lord Boyle's 'empire' {{as merely}} being {{exclusively}} {{confined to the}} development of the 'Raleigh estates': for instance, his acquisition of the entirety of the town of Bandon was not completed until 1625. Other towns which also form part of Boyle's municipal development legacy (which records employment of over 4,000 people during his lifetime) include Midleton, Castlemartyr, Charleville and Doneraile.|$|E
25|$|When {{scientists}} use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry.

It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.|$|E

25|$|Modulus {{refers to}} the {{stiffness}} of the graphite, not the amount of material used {{or the number of}} graphite fibres incorporated into the sheets. Buying a rod based solely on the modulus rating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> because other factors must be considered, for example, if the fisherman does not want the stiffest rod for light line techniques or cranking. In addition, other qualities must be incorporated in the graphite itself and the rod must be designed correctly to ensure the best performance and durability of the rod. The other components that go into a quality rod can also add significantly to the cost.|$|E
25|$|Chapter 2 {{is about}} {{economics}} {{as it has}} been practised in the years leading up to 2009. The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> because mathematical models will always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, and that this is partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering good advice. Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business cycle theory and efficient market theory.|$|E

25|$|Leosthenes (Greek: Λεωσθένης; died 323 BC) was an Athenian who was {{commander}} of the combined Greek army in the Lamian War. Leosthenes is usually identified {{as the son of}} that Leosthenes who had suffered exile in 362/1 BC and who had fled to the court of Philip II. It is unknown by what means he had obtained the high reputation he had when he first makes his appearance in history. It has been generally inferred, from a passage in Strabo, that he had first served under Alexander the Great in Asia; but it now seems certain that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and rather the reference should have been to Leonnatus.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has found}} a genetic {{component}} in sleep paralysis. The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence {{to the idea that}} sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.|$|E
