The writing problems, such as lexical poverty and miscollocations, are commonly seen in their writing. DDL, a corpus-assisted language learning approach, was considered as advantageous in solving learners’ writing problems. But to ensure the effectiveness of DDL activities, a careful design should be considered. An examination of previous <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> in writing demonstrates that the following factors may affect the learning outcomes of DDL activities.|$|E
40|$|Since Tim Johns ’ (1991 a, 1991 b) {{pioneering}} articles, {{the number}} of data-driven learning (<b>DDL)</b> <b>studies</b> {{of the use of}} corpora in the English language teaching (ELT) classroom has been increasing. While most of them have involved students at the university level, there has been very little research involving secondary school students. This study reports the findings of a computer-aided error analysis (CEA) of a Korean secondary school students ’ corpus and an investigation into students ’ and teachers ’ attitudes towards concordance-based materials and a DDL approach to teaching writing and grammar in the Korean ELT classroom. The CEA was conducted on a small corpus (19, 610 words) of writing in English produced by Korean secondary school students and identified the most common errors they produced using the error-tagging software tool, UCLEE (Dagneaux, et al., 1996). The findings revealed the ten most frequent error types...|$|E
40|$|Many uses {{have been}} found for corpora in {{language}} teaching and learning, most radically perhaps where learners explore the data themselves. Such procedures are especially associated with Tim Johns, who proposed what he called 'data-driven learning' over 20 years ago. While he described his techniques in detail {{in a number of}} papers, researchers and practitioners over the years have adapted Johns' procedures and invented new ones of their own, with the result that {{it can be difficult to}} pin down exactly what DDL is. In a tribute to Johns, this paper traces the evolution of DDL through his work from 1984 up until his death in 2009, as well as in <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> by other researchers. The enormous variety of activities possible with corpora means it is difficult if not impossible to identify any single element which is either necessary or sufficient for an activity to qualify as DDL. This paper therefore defends a prototype definition of DDL: the further an activity is from the central, prototypical core, the less DDL-like it is, but any cut-off point beyond which we might like to say 'this is no longer DDL' seems likely to be arbitrary rather than empirically grounded or based on a coherent, hermetic definition...|$|E

30|$|Data-driven {{learning}} (DDL), {{involving the}} {{direct or indirect}} application of corpus technology, has received considerable attention among researchers and teachers {{over the past two}} decades. Johns and King (1991), being generally regarded as the most influential advocates of DDL, defined DDL as “the use in the classroom of computer-generated concordances to get students to explore regularities of patterning in the target language, and the development of activities and exercises based on concordance output”. Later, DDL was interpreted in various ways by different researchers thus {{there seemed to be no}} single and watertight definition of DDL (Boulton 2011). However, it could be found that the common aspects of DDL are the use of authentic corpus data and student-centered exploratory learning activities (e.g. Boulton 2009, 2010, 2011; Smart 2014). Compared with the traditional rule-based language learning approach, DDL has its own advantages in the following aspects: Firstly, DDL is based on naturally-occurring language in corpora, which can provide authentic input for learners. Secondly, DDL promotes learners’ active involvement in the learning process, which usually requires learners to discover or explore language rules by themselves based on their observation and analysis of the concordance output. Thirdly, unlike the rule-based language learning tending to separate grammar and lexis, DDL fosters a more lexico-grammatical approach by allowing students to use a concordancer to retrieve frequently occurred lexical or grammatical patterns for a search item (Flowerdew 2015). Due to the above advantages, DDL is suggested as effective in promoting foreign language or second language (L 2) learning. The earlier <b>studies</b> about <b>DDL</b> were mostly theoretical but recent years have witnessed an increasing number of empirical <b>studies</b> about <b>DDL.</b> These <b>studies</b> have generally confirmed the positive sides of DDL in various aspects of language learning, such as promoting learner autonomy, increasing language awareness, enhancing noticing skills, extending learners’ cognitive abilities, etc.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} {{analysis}} of previous <b>DDL</b> <b>studies,</b> {{it becomes clear}} that task type, methodology, language proficiency and training as well as the choice of corpora are important variables to be considered while designing DDL activities. It is also obvious that the carefully designed DDL activities are effective in helping learners solve some writing problems. Nevertheless, there are still some limitations of these studies. Firstly, most of the studies just focus on the immediate effects of DDL in classroom settings or computer labs such as improving the accuracy of error-correction. However, as remarked by Boulton (2011), the biggest advantage of DDL lies in medium-term or longer-term benefits. Secondly, {{there is a lack of}} empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of different types of corpora in DDL activities. To complement existing research and to aid teachers in presenting future guidance to students, the present study conducts an empirical study on EFL learners in mainland China, aiming to achieve the following purposes. Firstly, it intends to explore whether the independent DDL activities outside the classroom over a whole term can facilitate EFL learners’ writing development in terms of fluency, accuracy and complexity. Secondly, to compare which type of corpora is more useful for Chinese EFL learners in DDL activities. Thirdly, to investigate EFL learners’ perceptions of BNCweb-assisted DDL activities.|$|E
40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{has contributed}} considerably to the arsenal of tools available for language description, with methodologies applicable to virtually any area of language study. Yet like most academic disciplines, corpus linguistics is generally limited to researchers and other professionals; {{in the fields}} of foreign/second language teaching and learning, this involves considerable mediation upstream before the results filter down to the end users - teachers and learners. An alternative would be for corpus data to feature directly in the learning process, with learners acting as "researchers" to explore the language themselves. This is commonly referred to as "data-driven learning" (DDL), an idea particularly associated with the seminal collection of papers edited by Johns and King (1991). The last 20 years has seen substantial research interest in DDL, with countless scholarly articles arguing its various merits, though it is frequently remarked that empirical research is disturbingly lacking. However, Boulton (forthcoming) lists over 70 studies which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 corpus consultation. This suggests that the research exists, but is fragmented and lacking in visibility and accessibility to a wider community. The aim of the present paper is to bring together the DDL research in ESP, where Gavioli (2005) argues convincingly that the learners represent a major population who stand to gain from DDL. An overview is presented of the tools, corpora, methodologies and research questions covered in 20 empirical <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> for ESP. The overwhelming majority show that learners are able to work with corpora in many contexts and for many purposes, and respond positively to the approach. In terms of learning outcomes, the results are generally promising, though not perhaps as conclusive as one might hope. Reasons for this are discussed, but it is argued that there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding corpus use in ESP {{in a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|E
40|$|Electronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in what has become known as “data-driven learning” (DDL). The arguments for and against have accumulated over nearly 30 years: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. One of {{the most important of these}} is the use of the technology itself: whether one sympathises that this is a problem or not, it is clearly an obstacle to DDL for a variety of reasons, and only removing the computer from the equation will help to overcome it. It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the very first instantiations of DDL relied heavily on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice in many <b>DDL</b> <b>studies.</b> However, to date there has been no empirical research aiming to compare the use of paper-based and hands-on corpus consultation directly. In this study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class, alternating between paper-based materials and hands-on consultation so that each learner had experience of both. After 10 weeks all students were at least moderately familiar with both formats; the efficiency of each was then compared by testing the final two items covered – language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. It is clear that some learners prefer working on paper at least initially, while others are quickly open to working directly on computer. The differences are discussed in relation to feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course, taking account of individual motivations and learning styles. The overall results suggest that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for <b>DDL.</b> The <b>study</b> looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to corpus consultation, and how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|R
40|$|Data-driven {{learning}} (DDL), an inductive teaching {{approach in}} which students learn through corpus interaction, has gained recent traction as way to teach specialized vocabulary in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes. There is little research, however, that addresses how to choose specialized vocabulary for teaching with <b>DDL.</b> This <b>study</b> addressed this gap in research by exploring the potential of a three-part analytical, corpus-based system for determining vocabulary to teach with DDL for a specific context of language use. This system included (1) identifying words that were significantly more frequent in a specialized expert corpus than in a corpus of general English, (2) narrowing to words that showed patterned differences in use between the specialized corpus and a student corpus, and (3) narrowing further to words with salient enough patterns of usage to teach with DDL. This three-part system {{was applied to the}} context of civil engineering in order to find vocabulary words to teach civil engineering students with low-proficiency writing skills at Portland State University. For the first step in my analytical system, I found 201 words that occurred significantly more frequently in civil engineering practitioner writing than in the Corpus of Contemporary American English and that met requirements for frequency, distribution, and other criteria. I tested the second and third steps on 45 of these words and identified 14 words that showed evidence of needing to be taught and being well suited to DDL. After reflecting on my process, I found that the analytical system was successful in meeting my goals for finding civil engineering vocabulary for data-driven activities. I also made several observations that may be useful for ESP teachers who are interested in applying this methodology for their classes, the most notable of which were: 1. The system was especially useful for connecting words that are not explicitly civil engineering themed (e. g., encountered or using) to important writing functions that civil engineers perform. 2. Although it provided a systematic basis for vocabulary teaching decisions, the process was generally time-consuming and required complex judgments, which indicated that it may only be worth performing if teachers plan to regularly incorporate DDL vocabulary instruction into their course...|$|R

The strains were distinct, were constitutively resistant via the synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-alanyl-d-lactate, and harbored a chromosomal vanD gene cluster that was not transferable. New mutations were found in conserved domains of VanSD: at T 170 I near the phosphorylation site in NEF 1, at V 67 A at the membrane surface in BM 4653, at G 340 S in the G 2 ATP-binding domain in BM 4655, in the F domain in BM 4656 (a 6 -bp insertion), and in the G 1 and G 2 domains of BM 4654 (three mutations). The mutations resulted in constitutivity, presumably through the loss of the phosphatase activity of the sensor. The chromosomal Ddl d-Ala:d-Ala ligase had an IS 19 copy in NEF 1, a mutation in the serine (S 185 F) or near the arginine (T 289 P) involved in d-Ala 1 binding in BM 4653 or BM 4655, respectively, and a mutation next to the lysine (P 180 S) involved in d-Ala 2 binding in BM 4654, leading to the production of an impaired enzyme. In BM 4653 vanYD, a new insertion sequence, ISEfa 9, belonging to the IS 3 family, resulted in the absence of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity. Strain BM 4656 had a functional d-Ala:d-Ala ligase, associated with high levels of both VanXD and VanYD activities, and is the first example of a VanD-type strain with a functional <b>Ddl</b> enzyme. <b>Study</b> of these five clinical isolates, displaying various assortments of mutations, confirms that all VanD-type strains isolated so far have undergone mutations in the vanSD or vanRD gene, leading to constitutive resistance, but that the Ddl host ligase is not always impaired.

40|$|International audienceElectronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in {{what has come to be}} known as "data-driven learning" or DDL (Johns 1990). The arguments for and against have accumulated over two decades and more: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. Certainly in its more extreme forms, it seems difficult to reconcile DDL with the reality of ordinary language classrooms (e. g. Mukherjee 2006). One of the most apparent obstacles here is the use of the technology itself - the computer with its query software and interfaces for accessing electronic corpora - which has repeatedly been found to pose substantial problems for many learners (e. g. Yoon & Hirvela 2004) as well as teachers (e. g. Farr 2008). Where this is the case, the obvious question is whether the computer can be successfully removed from the equation without losing the benefits of the overall approach (cf. Boulton 2010). It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous, hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the earliest instantiations of DDL relied almost exclusively on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials can be argued to allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice in many <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> (see Boulton forthcoming for a review). Each approach has its adherents, but to date there has been little if any empirical research attempting a direct comparison of the use of paper-based and hands-on corpus consultation. This study draws on past experience with two different groups of students learning English at an architecture college in France. In the first case, the learners were highly receptive to an encounter with printed DDL materials (Boulton 2010); in the second, a hands-on approach to corpus consultation was far less well received (Boulton 2009). However, the varying conditions mean that direct comparisons are difficult to make. In the present study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students at the same college were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class. Each group covered the same points using essentially the same processes, but alternated between 'hands-on' consultation (i. e. on computer) and paper-based materials (i. e. 'hands-off'). In this way, after 10 weeks all the students (n= 30) should have been at least moderately familiar with both approaches. The learning outcomes of the hands-on and hands-off approaches were compared by testing the final two items covered - language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. The results were compared against feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course on the participants' preferences and affective reactions. Previous experience suggests that those who do best are not necessarily most receptive, and vice versa. In an attempt to identify some of the variables that may underlie the individual differences, two instruments were used to relate the outcomes and reactions to motivation and learning styles. The overall conclusion seems to be that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCorpus {{linguistics}} is, by {{its very}} nature, an applied field, with potential relevance in any area which deals with text {{in one form or}} another. One of the earliest such applications was in language teaching, where it is commonly associated with the work of Tim Johns (1990). He coined the phrase data-driven learning (DDL), which is still commonly used as a cover term for any use of language corpora or associated corpus linguistic tools or techniques for L 2 users. The last 20 -odd years have seen considerable output of academic papers in the area, outlining possible activities, describing actual courses, explaining and justifying the rationale, and so on. The obvious question, of course, is: "Does it work?" There are several ways of addressing this, the most obvious being to conduct an original study to collect new data on specific questions. As individual studies accumulate, however, some kind of overview becomes necessary to gain a broader picture of the field as a whole. Considerable work in applied linguistics over recent years has sought to find ways to make such research synthesis as systematic as possible, and can generally be divided into two broad streams: narrative synthesis and meta-analysis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages (see the papers in Norris and Ortega 2006 for an overview). The narrative synthesis is not unlike the traditional 'literature review' which features in the introductions to many academic papers. It differs in avoiding the narrow focus of a specific topic, and attempts a systematic trawl of all relevant publications, thus reducing the subjective selection of papers for consideration. But it potentially falls down on the rigour of the analysis itself, which can retain some of the problems inherent in literature reviews (e. g. Boulton 2010 on learning outcomes of DDL; Boulton 2012 on DDL in English for Specific Purposes). The meta-analysis involves essentially the same systematic collection of papers, but focuses exclusively on quantitative studies, thus neglecting the value of qualitative studies (for an overview, see Richards 2009). It is thus less broad in coverage than the narrative synthesis, and the analysis is potentially reductive and simplistic, lumping together of all types of specificities of individual studies. Its advantage is that it allows a pooling of the quantitative data from all relevant studies available. This paper presents a meta-analysis of <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> (cf. the preliminary work in Cobb and Boulton forthcoming). The work is still in progress, but to date we have collected 140 papers which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 corpus use, of which 21 provide suitable quantitative data - minimally, means and standard deviations deriving from pre/post-tests and/or experimental/control groups. Work so far suggests a substantial effect size, currently standing at 1. 42 standard deviations. Focus on a single effect size figure can be strategically or politically expedient (cf. Grgurović et al. 2013), but meta-analysts are keen to go beyond this to avoid a reductionist picture in such a complex area as language learning (cf. Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008). This paper thus seeks to situate the study, with the focus correspondingly not only on the outcome itself but also on the issues raised in collecting and selecting the studies for inclusion, as well as in analysing and sorting the resulting data. Due consideration is given in particular to the deliberately broad definition of DDL, which we have taken to include all uses of corpora by non-native speakers. This seems to be compatible with Johns' original vision, and since DDL clearly means a range of different things to different people, it seems sensible to begin with a broad sweep. We also discuss the inclusion / exclusion criteria in the selection process: we make no distinction between papers appearing in prestigious peer-reviewed journals and elsewhere - smaller journals, book chapters, conference proceedings, as well as 'grey' literature in the form of unpublished doctoral theses (though we exclude research which has not been formally written up, such as unpublished conference presentations or slides). This should ensure that quality work published outside mainstream sources is not ignored, and that negative outcomes in particular {{are less likely to be}} overlooked (Oswald and Plonsky 2010). Some meta-analyses have introduced weighting systems, though we have initially attempted to avoid such a priori judgements. Other issues arise from the pooling of quantitative data from highly varied studies - in other words, are the studies sufficiently similar that their results can be legitimately pooled at all? Though we argue that we are not comparing apples and oranges in the overall meta-analysis, the studies can usefully be grouped into different sub-categories for more in-depth understanding, and in one of two ways. In terms of research design, particular importance is accorded to the distinction between the effectiveness of a treatment (as measured by within-groups pre/post-tests: ES = 1. 68; d =. 84) and its relative efficiency (between groups: ES = 1. 04; d =. 73). In terms of research questions, it is also possible to derive a number of sub-categorisations allowing meta-analyses of subsets depending on more focused topics, thus allowing greater depth of understanding on more specific issues. As in corpus linguistics, raw data and statistics are useful, but they need interpretation and contextualisation to become meaningful. A careful meta-analysis, with transparent inclusion criteria and sensitivity to individual differences between studies, provides one way of combining both, underlining the importance of effect size in relation to statistical significance (cf. Duff et al. 2007). As such, it allows us to go some way towards overcoming the fragmentation of the field and to provide some kind of evaluation of the state of research in DDL as a whole. In devising more focused subsets of studies, we are able to adopt a realistic evaluation (Pawson and Tilley 1997) and address not just the question of 'Does it work?', but how effective and efficient it might be in different forms for different learners for different purposes in different circumstances.

30|$|The first {{important}} factor is task type since not all writing {{problems can be}} solved equally well by DDL approach. In previous <b>studies,</b> <b>DDL</b> is adopted to learn linking adverbials (Boulton 2009; Cotos 2014), to aid learners in generating ideas and writing creatively (Kennedy and Miceli 2010), to distinguish synonym adjectives and solve learners’ problems of overusing general adjectives (Yeh et al. 2007), to learn collocation knowledge and thus help learners produce more accurate and complex language patterns (Thomas 2015). However, it seems that error-correction is the most appropriate task for DDL because a great many studies (e.g. Gaskell and Cobb 2004; Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Tono et al. 2014; Reynolds 2015 a) focused on error-correction or self-editing in writing. For instance, Gaskell and Cobb (2004) explored the immediate effects of adopting DDL in correcting L 2 learners’ sentence-level grammatical errors in writing. The results revealed that concordance evidence for lower-level learners’ grammar development was not as effective as for lexical development. Nevertheless, the results still proved {{the positive effects of}} corpus use since more than 80  % corrections were made accurately when the online concordance links were offered to them while less accurate corrections were made when removing the links. There are another two studies (Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006) focusing on the efficacy of DDL in correcting more various kinds of errors, which include lexico-grammatical errors, capitalization errors, spelling errors, etc. These findings confirmed the advantages of DDL in reducing the interference of the mother tongue, highlighting the awareness of lexico-grammatical patterns and improving the accuracy rate of error corrections. Nevertheless, not all types of errors can be corrected equally well with a DDL approach. Thus more recently, Tono et al. (2014) conducted a research on 93 upper-intermediate undergraduate students, aiming {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} DDL in correcting three coded error types. The results revealed that omission and addition errors were easier to be identified and revised, while mis-formation errors were more difficult to be corrected accurately. These studies indicated that although DDL can be adopted to solve various writing problems, some types of tasks may be more appropriate for DDL thus teachers should carefully consider the appropriateness of tasks while organizing DDL activities.|$|R
