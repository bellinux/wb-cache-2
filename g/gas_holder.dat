25|$|Called {{in by the}} Imperial Continental Gas Association in 1863 {{to replace}} a failed roof over a {{telescoping}} <b>gas</b> <b>holder,</b> Schwedler devised a workable solution but thinking further about the problem, in 1866 published an article describing {{a new type of}} iron cupola that was simpler, lighter, and as sturdy: it takes the form of an unsupported spheroidal steel vault, rather than beams, and was normally used to span distances of 2545m. He used Schwedler cupolas in designing four new gas holders for Berlin's street lighting, of which the one now known as the Fichte-Bunker (1874) survives, and the only deterrent to their use today is the cost of labour. He designed the cupolas on Berlin's New Synagogue (1863) and the Sedan Panorama at Alexanderplatz Station.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Surrey County Cricket Club, tenants of The Oval, {{announced}} plans to redevelop it along the side nearest the <b>gas</b> <b>holders.</b> However, their redevelopment plans were objected to by the Health and Safety Executive because of the proximity to the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> and amid fears that they might explode despite not cracking or leaking since construction. This view was supported by London Fire Brigade, who listed the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> as a hazardous site. As a result, Surrey considered buying the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> and decommissioning them. The objection of the Health and Safety Executive {{was rejected by the}} Secretary of State and planning inspector.|$|R

While the Metropolitan Police were searching the tunnel, the bomb detonated at 12:40am, causing an explosion in a <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> near the southern exit. This resulted in a fire on another <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> approximately an hour later. No injuries were reported.

The four aircraft in the 1946 High Speed Handicap were a Vampire (flown by Geoffrey de Havilland), Hornet (Geoffrey Pike), Fury (William Humble) and Seafang (Guy Morgan). The race was won by the Fury flown by Humble. John Cunningham competed in the 1947 High Speed Handicap in Vampire F1 VZ332, coming sixth. Peter Twiss flying a Firefly IV won the high-speed race at [...] The winner received the Hythe Aero Trophy and £100. The 1948 High Speed Handicap Race was won by Flt Lt J Colquhoun in a two-seat Spitfire. The course was Capel airship hangar, Folkestone pier and Hythe <b>gas</b> <b>holder.</b> In 1950, competitors in the Daily Express South Coast Air Race used Lympne before the race started. This race was won by Nick Charlton in Proctor G-AHUZ.|$|E

Benzole as a vehicle fuel and coal tar as the main feedstock for the emerging organic chemical industry provided the gas industry with substantial revenues.
