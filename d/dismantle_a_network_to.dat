40|$|In November 2008, Colombian {{authorities}} <b>dismantled</b> <b>a</b> <b>network</b> of Ponzi schemes, making {{hundreds of}} thousands of investors lose {{tens of millions of dollars}} throughout the country. Using original data on the geographical incidence of the Ponzi schemes, this paper estimates the impact of their break down on crime. We find that the crash of Ponzi schemes differentially exacerbated crime in affected districts. Confirming the intuition of the standard economic model of crime, this effect is only present in places with relatively weak judicial and law enforcement institutions, and with little access to consumption smoothing mechanisms such as microcredit. In addition, we show that, with the exception of economically-motivated felonies such as robbery, violent crime is not affected by the negative shock...|$|R

25|$|On 11 October 2011, the {{struggle}} between the Metros and the Rojos intensified when the Mexican authorities found the body of César Dávila García inside an abandoned house in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Inside the abandoned house, the corpse of El Comandante Gama, Dávila García's code name, had been shot with a 9 mm pistol. According to the Mexican authorities, {{the man was a}} top financial operator in the Gulf Cartel and a close associate of the former drug lord Antonio Cárdenas Guillén. After the drug lord's death, Dávila García became the regional drug baron of the coastal city of Tampico, Tamaulipas before moving back to Matamoros. Neither faction in the Gulf Cartel claimed responsibility for his death, but Mexican intelligence sources indicated that Dávila García was killed by the Metros. The assassination also happened a day after the Mexican Navy <b>dismantled</b> <b>a</b> <b>network</b> of the Gulf Cartel in three municipalities across Tamaulipas, where 35 cartel members were arrested. Ricardo Salazar Pequeño, the regional boss of the cartel in Ciudad Miguel Alemán, along with the cartel's accountant Gabriela Gómez Robles, were apprehended.
