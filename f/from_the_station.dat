5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, that passed the station in a level crossing.

5|$|On 15 September 1881, a {{light engine}} and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the mouth}} of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error.

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E

5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents.

In 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found crawling around on the tracks between the platforms. The police removed him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> and sent him home in a taxi.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of those first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
