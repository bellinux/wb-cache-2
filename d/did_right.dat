Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he <b>did</b> <b>right</b> in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
500|$|In 1951, with secret {{means of}} {{communications}} established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. [...] He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. [...] In January 1953, Speer {{began work on}} his draft memoirs, {{and over the next}} year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. [...] Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. [...] Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. [...] Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he <b>did</b> <b>right</b> and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she <b>did</b> <b>right,</b> but it certainly wasn't a difficult thing to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Reality Takes a Holiday" [...] Marshall says, [...] "I don't {{have a dog}} named Toto.

Later in the episode, Dash X says, [...] "he's {{the kind of guy}} who actually believes that there's no place like home".|$|E
2500|$|Halo 5s {{campaign}} and story received mixed reviews. Timothy J. Seppala of Engadget {{felt it was}} the first time in years that the campaign felt like a step backward compared to its predecessor; [...] "instead of addressing what it got wrong with [...] and doubling down on what it <b>did</b> <b>right,</b> the team fundamentally altered how a Halo campaign works to horrendous results" [...] In contrast, Albert praised the campaign for challenging enemies and environments dense with secret pathways and hidden weapons. [...] "This kind of design makes Halo 5s campaign ripe for replaying, and well suited for the [...] co-op it's clearly made for", he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Anyway, a {{transfer}} to his summer residence {{was out of}} question for obvious reasons: then two days later he was accompanied to Gaeta, whence the corvette Persefone {{brought him to the}} island of Ponza. After several weeks, he was then transferred to the island of La Maddalena, and finally to Campo Imperatore, where he remained until 12 September 1943, when a German commando unit led by Otto Skorzeny freed him. After the arrest of Mussolini, the King met the queen, who told her husband: [...] "What you <b>did</b> <b>right</b> now was not nice. Mussolini was our guest."

2500|$|However, Sampson {{controversially}} left Harkes off the World Cup squad, citing [...] "leadership issues", {{although the}} decision was never fully explained at the time. The bitterness resulting from the omission and {{the irony of the}} [...] "Captain for Life" [...] title would serve as the inspiration for his autobiography, Captain for Life: And Other Temporary Assignments (...) , co-written with Denise Kiernan and published in 1999. In the book, Harkes criticized Sampson for lacking [...] "credibility to a group of guys who had hundreds and hundreds of caps among them" [...] and [...] "putting a huge amount of pressure on young, internationally inexperienced players", and concluded, [...] "I can't think of one thing that Steve <b>did</b> <b>right</b> {{in the months leading up}} to the World Cup". The 1998 team went on to lose all three games in the group stage, finishing last overall.|$|E
