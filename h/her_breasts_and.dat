When his first prayer comes true, he asks the glee club to join him in honoring Jesus through song.|$|E
5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding a rooster {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to castration or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes {{as the result of}} her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E

He becomes so desperate {{that when he}} and Lois are at the park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up.

25|$|Boyer {{published}} I Married Wyatt Earp with {{a picture}} {{on the cover of}} a woman wearing a sheer gauze peignoir, re-touched to conceal <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> nipples. He insisted that the picture of the partially nude woman was Josephine when she was young, and that Johnny Behan took the photo of her in Tombstone in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Oops!... I Did It Again - Britney Spears wears a red shiny catsuit. The catsuit {{presented}} {{with a number of}} problems during shooting of the video. It trapped so much heat that sweat flew off her sleeves every time she flicked a hand or twirled. The suit flattened <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> extra padding had to be added, which kept slipping off.|$|E
25|$|Crandon {{performed}} {{many of her}} séances in the nude, and {{was reported}} to throw herself onto the laps of her male sitters. She was also described as an alcoholic. During séances, Eric Dingwall told Crandon to take off her clothes {{and sit in the}} nude. Crandon would also sometimes sprinkle luminous powder on <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> because of such activities William McDougall and other psychical researchers criticized Dingwall for having improper relations with Crandon.|$|E
60|$|She was {{sleeping}} peacefully, her thin hands folded on <b>her</b> <b>breast,</b> <b>and</b> {{he drew a}} sigh of relief.|$|R

25|$|Wright, {{who was one}} of Thomas' {{subordinates}} at the EEOC {{until he}} fired her, told Senate Judiciary Committee staff that Thomas had repeatedly made comments to her much like those he allegedly made to Hill, including pressuring her for dates, asking her the size of <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> <b>and</b> frequently commenting on the anatomy of other women. Wright said that after she turned down Thomas for a date, Thomas began to express discontent with her work and eventually fired her. Thomas said that he fired Wright for poor performance and for using a homophobic epithet.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with the lengths to which his wife goes {{to connect with the}} lizards. Because Sarah has never seen a mammal's mammaries, Nancy shows Sarah <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> {{explains}} their function. Nancy would also have shown Leslie except for Charlie's protestations. While Nancy does become a bit frustrated with the lizards' intellectual limitations, she becomes increasingly annoyed with Charlie's condescending attitude toward them. Yet, when the lizards want to go back—after Charlie drives Sarah to tears, and Leslie beats him up—Nancy wants them to stay and offers them help. This experience has given Nancy the excitement she craves, and she ensures that it continues.|$|E
25|$|From {{their arrival}} in 1922, the Crosbys led {{the life of}} rich expatriates. They were {{attracted}} to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled in an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Polly donned her red bathing suit and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark business suit, formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that she thought the exercise was good for <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> <b>and</b> she enjoyed the attention.|$|E

25|$|In May 1973, Chikatilo {{committed}} {{his first}} known sexual assault upon {{one of his}} pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, Chikatilo sexually assaulted another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom. He was not disciplined for either of these incidents, or for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed Chikatilo fondling himself {{in the presence of}} his students. One of Chikatilo's duties at this school was ensuring his students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls' dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed.|$|E
25|$|Disguised as nobles, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce {{take the}} bodies of Kröd and Aneka to Dongalor, seeking the reward money. Dongalor tests whether Aneka is alive by rubbing his face in <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> licking her face, which he declines to do for Kröd's body. However, Kröd starts to wake up and, having missed {{sleeping}} with Aneka, starts to spoon her still unconscious body. Dongalor orders his guards to kill Kröd but, seeing how weak and disoriented he is from the potion, opts to do so himself and begins taunting Kröd, planning to torture him by killing the still-unconscious Aneka, and then Krӧd. However, a mysterious man (James Murray) swings through a nearby window, knocks Dongalor and Barnabus away, saving Kröd and Aneka, who are dragged {{out of the room}} by their friends to safety.|$|E
25|$|The pageantry {{following}} the statues {{and the introduction}} of Eros continued to portray scenes that showed the sequence of Greek civilisation through its art. The scenes started with the Minoan civilisation. The first float featured the iconic image of Minoan civilization: that of the fertility goddess clad in a bodice exposing <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> clutching serpents in both hands. The subsequent floats then featured scenes of bull-jumping, dolphins, and other elements that harkened back to the images in the frescoes of Phaestos. The scenes then proceeded to the more stark art of the Mycenean civilisation, followed by representations of the Classical period. A chariot carrying an actor portraying Alexander the Great introduced images from the Hellenistic period, which in turn were followed by representations of Byzantine art, the Greek War of Independence, and lastly of 20th century elements of Greek culture, such as the popular shadow-theatre figure Karagiozis, who {{is said to be a}} humorous and self-deprecating depiction (and parody) of Greek mentality.|$|E

500|$|In 2016, Madonna, whilst {{channeling}} {{the theme}} [...] "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology", provided {{one of the}} most controversial outfits in the gala's history. She appeared in an ensemble designed by Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci exposing both <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> buttocks. Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating [...] "We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to women’s rights we are still in the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement".|$|E
500|$|Lord Robert {{has come}} so much into favour {{that he does}} {{whatever}} he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night. People talk of this so freely that they {{go so far as}} to say that his wife has a malady in one of <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> the Queen is only waiting for her to die to marry Lord Robert ... Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty's behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cocoon" [...] was {{directed}} by Eiko Ishioka and was shot in April 2001 in New York City. One of Björk's most avant-garde music videos, it: [...] "plays with minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body". Red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon. Björk actually wore a very close-fitting body suit. Although not as controversial as the [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] music video, it was still banned from MTV. The three music videos {{were included in the}} DVDs Volumen Plus (2002) and Greatest Hits - Volumen 1993–2003 (2002).|$|E

500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the tone of his work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [...] Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
500|$|As Perry sits {{in her car}} {{outside of}} her boyfriend's job, she sees her boyfriend (played by actor and model Lucas Kerr) {{interacting}} flirtatiously with a woman. She confronts him in his office, and ends their relationship. The title track begins as she drives to a gas station, where she buys a can of tea. After paying for her items, she sees a moto-sticker on a notice board which reads, [...] "All women are created equal, then some become Marines". The increasingly emotional Perry gathers her possessions from her car trunk, enters a nearby restroom, and begins her change of identity. She cuts her hair short (at this point bursting into tears), removes her bracelets, flattens <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> <b>and</b> changes into a hoodie and jeans.|$|E
500|$|In 1670, Rosmadec {{approached}} Claude de Lannion {{again and}} requested him {{to break the}} statue into pieces. Lannion ordered this to be done. However, the workmen, for fear of the peasants and devotees, only mutilated one of <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> <b>and</b> one arm and again threw the statue into the same river. Soon after this, Claude de Lannion fell from his horse and died, which devotees considered as [...] "a judgement from heaven for his having consented to destroy the idol." [...] The statue remained in the river for 25 years until Bishop Rosmadec decided to root out paganism in his diocese and asked Pierre de Lannion, son of Claude de Lannion, to destroy the statue. As Pierre was an antiquarian, he pulled the statue up from the river in 1695 but did not destroy it. The events associated with the demolition and restoration became a local cause célèbre.|$|E
