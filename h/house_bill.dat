5|$|Residential {{development}} of the mountain's southern foothills {{has been on the}} rise for several years, primarily in the form of single-family residences. Construction costs have continued to rise as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon <b>House</b> <b>Bill</b> 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new foundations to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of retrofitting an existing structure approached $100,000.|$|E

In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28billion (about USD597million) or ₱310 ($7) per person but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the <b>House</b> <b>Bill</b> 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill).|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended <b>House</b> <b>bill,</b> he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas <b>House</b> <b>bill.</b> House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed <b>House</b> <b>Bill</b> 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E
5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E

5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into {{both houses of}} the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 2004, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Missouri House of Representatives by State Representatives Rod Jetton and Jason Crowell. Jetton had originally proposed the hadrosaur as the state dinosaur, but was not specific enough, so the House Conservation and Natural Resources Committee settled on Hypsibema missouriensis. The bill was then sent to the 92nd Missouri General Assembly. It passed the Missouri House of Representatives on March 8, 2004 with a vote of 147–4, the Missouri Senate on May 14, 2004 with a vote of 34–0, and was approved by then-governor Bob Holden on July 9, 2004. The bill, <b>House</b> <b>Bill</b> 1209, went into effect August 28, 2004. Missouri became the sixth U.S. state to have designated an official state dinosaur, following Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and Wyoming, as well as the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The <b>House</b> <b>bill</b> allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
50|$|As {{chairman}} of the State Affairs Committee, Cook in 2017 blocked, {{with the backing of}} Speaker Joe Straus, House consideration of the Senate-passed bathroom bill, which would require persons to use public rest rooms corresponding with their genitalia at birth. He also barred a vote on HB 1813, which would protect the religious liberty and conscience rights of county clerks and justices of the peace regarding marriage licenses and ceremonies. <b>House</b> <b>bills</b> must pass <b>House</b> committees by May 8.
