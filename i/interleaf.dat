25|$|Kriegsman {{has been}} writing and porting {{open-source}} software for 30 years. He founded and ran pioneering software companies, including Document.com, later acquired by Merrill, and Clearway Technologies, acquired by Mirror Image Internet. After college, Kriegsman worked for Cognitive Systems, Inc. (started by notable AI researcher Roger Schank), developing large scale rule-based, statistical, and text-processing AI systems. He later integrated those three technologies in a paper he wrote for IEEE. Designing document management systems at <b>Interleaf</b> led him to found his first startup, Document.com. After founding Clearway, Kriegsman was a senior developer at @stake, which was later acquired by Symantec.|$|E
2500|$|Ideas that {{developed}} during discussion that are novel in XML included the algorithm for encoding detection and the encoding header, the processing instruction target, the xml:space attribute, {{and the new}} close delimiter for empty-element tags. The notion of well-formedness as opposed to validity (which enables parsing without a schema) was first formalized in XML, although it had been implemented successfully in the Electronic Book Technology [...] "Dynatext" [...] software; the software from the University of Waterloo New Oxford English Dictionary Project; the RISP LISP SGML text processor at Uniscope, Tokyo; the US Army Missile Command IADS hypertext system; Mentor Graphics Context; <b>Interleaf</b> and Xerox Publishing System.|$|E

It was a passage {{towards the end of}} the third act--a passage of the most heart-stirring excitement--a passage which, although tainted with impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion--no woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and, upon the opposite <b>interleaf,</b> were the following English lines, written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:-- ...|$|E

Using <b>Interleaf's</b> technical publishing system's ability to reformat documents rapidly, Worldview Press enabled the creation of documents formatted for particular delivery vehicles.

5000|$|RDM was {{an early}} {{document}} management product, acquired in the late 1980s and then integrated with <b>Interleaf's</b> other products.

Team of authors and editors would [...] "check in" [...] their documents when done with a work session, and begin a new session by [...] "checking them out." [...] In so doing, RDM would ensure that the authors {{were working on the}} most current version of the document, even if another author had worked on it in the interim.|$|R

50|$|After several versions, Author/Editor {{was sold}} with the Panorama suite to <b>Interleaf</b> in September, 1998. At the same time, the Toronto {{development}} team, led by David A. Keldsen, joined <b>Interleaf</b> to help focus {{the company on}} content management and create new products. By that point, SoftQuad's focus had shifted to its descendants, HoTMetaL and XMetaL. <b>Interleaf</b> did not produce new versions of Author/Editor. Sales were discontinued in 2000.|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{facilitate}} the (re) generation of integral theory and integral education theory through exploring and enacting postconventional modalities emerging from worldviews and paradigms beyond modernity and formal thought. Its quest sits in service to humanity-within-biosphere, with particular reference to education. The format involves a collection of published papers (one co-authored) cohered through an extensive introduction, <b>interleafs,</b> and conclusion. A generative critique of Ken Wilber’s integral theory is given, notably through a focused engagement with postformal thought. This leads to an ecology of academic fields being brought into play to help generate new types of integral thinking. Such exploration also helps develop postformal theory or postconventional poetics. In addition to postformal thought, fields include complexity theory, critical theory, ecosophy, futures studies, hermeneutics, poetics and poststructuralism. Each variously contributes to the postconventional ensemble which is cohered through creative transdisciplinarity: complexity theory supports an emergent research process and a partly decentralised format; critical theory emphasises {{the contrast between the}} modern-formal developmental level and that beyond; Guattari’s ecosophy complexly integrates biospherical, social and conceptual domains; futures studies complements historical awareness regarding temporal contextualisation; hermeneutics foregrounds construct-awareness; poetics enables an enactment of the metaphor “text as music”; whilst poststructuralism precipitates a deterritorialisation and “dialecticisation” of integral theory in addition to a querying of certain textual conventions. Contexts of integral studies and integral education are addressed, both theoretically through Ernest Boyer’s scholarship of integration, and historically through the identification of a Western genealogy including Classical, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, Renaissance, Humanist and Reconstructive Postmodern moments. Additionally, planetary consciousness is effected through Native American, Islamic and counter-hegemonic perspectives. Critiques include address of modernistic “economies of truth” including economism, technicism and atomism, Wilber’s orientation toward Green thinking, Richard Slaughter’s perspective on Causal Layered Analysis, and Wilberian integral education theory. Valorisations are given to “complexities of truth” including archetypes, “eco-logics,” holarchies, “nanotextology,” open systems, spiritual orientations, and vision-logic. Cross-level education is addressed in relation to content (knowledge, curricula), occasion (identities, pedagogy) and system; for each, a critical contrast is identified between approaches and interpretations following a modern atomistic template and those arising from more integrative sensibilities with respect to complexities of identity, peer relationalities and contextusalisations. The study contributes to numerous discourses including integral studies, postconventional studies, philosophy of education, critical education, ecology, futures studies, and transdisciplinarity entailing the meta-dialogue between art and science. Framed as an ethical “conceptual concerto,” this creative academic artefact offers “passion for the possible. ...|$|R

50|$|Kodak renamed its KEEPS {{publishing}} and copier line to Lionheart. By then, the division {{lost most of}} the people who really understood the product and the publishing industry.
