40|$|We {{developed}} a new <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> mimicking tear flow to evaluate the epithelial tight junction of rabbit cornea quantitatively. We investigated the effect of tear flow on the corneal damage induced by ophthalmic preservatives using this method. An Ussing chamber system with Ag/AgCl electrodes {{was used in the}} electrophysiological experiment. The excised rabbit cornea was mounted in the Ussing chamber and the precorneal solution in the chamber was perfused with a peristaltic pump at the rate of human tear flow. Corneal transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was monitored as corneal barrier ability. In the <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> mimicking tear flow, we observed stable TEER, which rapidly decreased with benzalkonium chloride (BAC), an eye drop preservative. Using this system, we first found that 0. 004 % BAC decreased corneal TEER reversibly. A high concentration of BAC showed strong irreversible damage to the tight junction. The influence of BAC on corneal TEER was not only concentration-dependent but also tear flow rate-dependent. The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> mimicking tear flow was useful to evaluate the corneal barrier quantitatively.

This review focuses on aspects of <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>methods</b> that make them particularly suited for the investigation of transporter function. Two major approaches to electrical recording of transporter activity are discussed: (a) artificial planar lipid membranes, such as the black lipid membrane and solid supported membrane, which are useful for studies on bacterial transporters and transporters of intracellular compartments, and (b) patch clamp and voltage clamp techniques, which investigate transporters in native cellular membranes. The analytical power of these methods is highlighted by several examples of mechanistic studies of specific membrane proteins, including cytochrome c oxidase, NhaA Na + /H + exchanger, ClC- 7 H + /Cl − exchanger, glutamate transporters, and neutral amino acid transporters.

40|$|To {{test whether}} or not the {{potassium}} permeability of the resting membrane is controlled by the excitable K channels (delayed rectifier), we examined changes in the Na and K permeability ratio, PNa/PK, of the squid axon before and after the excitable K channels were blocked. The blockage of the K channels was accomplished by three independent methods: internal application of tetraethylammonium, internal application of 4 -aminopyridine plus Cs, and prolong internal perfusion of NaF solution. The permeability ratio was determined using two different methods: the conventional <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> and a new method based on the measurements of the hyperpolarizing effect of Na removal. We found that blocking the K channels did not cause a proportional decrease in the K permeability of the resting membrane, suggesting that the semipermeable property of the resting membrane is not determined by the excitable K channels...|$|E
30|$|The {{perception}} of visual signals {{is determined by}} two components: the physical characteristics of a habitat and the sensory properties of a receiver (Endler 1990); therefore, a change {{in one of these}} two components tends to drive the development of substitute signals in response to variable habitats (Chunco et al. 2007; Endler 1980), which has been demonstrated by several studies (Dalton et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2007). Based on the observation that the two aforementioned and closely related bitterlings exhibit distinct nuptial colorations, it is hypothesized that the differences in their nuptial colorations may be related to variations in photic properties of its habitats and/or spectral sensitivities of the fish. To test this hypothesis, the spectral sensitivities of these two bitterlings were recorded with <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> and the light spectra of their habitats were measured and compared.|$|E

50|$|Neurobiological {{methods can}} be grouped {{together}} into ones that measure more external bodily responses, <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>methods,</b> hemodynamic measures, and lesion methods.

40|$|Glyoxysomes of {{endosperm}} {{tissue of}} castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) seedlings were solubilized in a detergent {{and added to}} a lipid bilayer. Conductivity measurements revealed that the glyoxysomal preparation contained a porin-like channel. Using an <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method,</b> which we established for semiquantitative determination of porin activity, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that glyoxysomal membranes purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation contain an integral membrane protein with porin activity. The porin of glyoxysomes was shown to have a relatively small single-channel conductance of about 330 picosiemens in 1 M KCl and to be strongly anion selective. Thus, the glyoxysomal porin differs from the other previously characterized porins in the outer membrane of mitochondria or plastids, but is similar to the porin of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaf peroxisomes. Our results suggest that, in analogy to the porin of leaf peroxisomes, the glyoxysomal porin facilitates the passage of small metabolites, such as succinate, citrate, malate, and aspartate, through the membrane...|$|E

The problem ofthe short available nerve segment ofthe intercostal nerves and the bizzare compound motor action potential (CMAP) of inconsistent latency while recording over the intercostal muscles, is overcome by applying recording electrodes over the rectus abdominis muscle and stimulating the nerves at two points at a fair distance away. With the use ofmultiple recording sites over the rectus abdominis, the motor points for different intercostal nerves were delineated. CMAP of reproducible latencies and waveforms with sharp take-off points were obtained. Conduction velocity of the intercostal nerves could be determined.

40|$|The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> {{we present}} {{is based on}} a solid {{supported}} membrane (SSM) composed of an octadecanethiol layer chemisorbed on a gold coated sensor chip and a phosphatidylcholine monolayer on top. This assembly is mounted into a cuvette system containing the reference electrode, a chlorinated silver wire. After adsorption of membrane fragments or proteoliposomes containing the membrane protein of interest, a fast solution exchange is used to induce the transport activity of the membrane protein. In the single solution exchange protocol two solutions, one non-activating and one activating solution, are needed. The flow is controlled by pressurized air and a valve and tubing system within a faraday cage. The kinetics of the electrogenic transport activity is obtained via capacitive coupling between the SSM and the proteoliposomes or membrane fragments. The method, therefore, yields only transient currents. The peak current represents the stationary transport activity. The time dependent transporter currents can be reconstructed by circuit analysis. This method is especially suited for prokaryotic transporters or eukaryotic transporters from intracellular membranes, which cannot be investigated by patch clamp or voltage clamp methods...|$|E

Sensorineural hearing loss represent one of the serious neurodevelopmental sequelae among preterm infants. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BAER) is a noninvasive <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>method</b> for assessing the maturation of auditory system in newborn. MATERIALS AND METHODS Brainstem auditory evoked responses of 70 infants (35 preterm and 35 term) were recorded to analyse the impact of prematurity. Absolute latency and interpeak latencies were recorded using “Intelligent Hearing System Smart-EP”. Student’s ttest was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The absolute latencies I, III, V and interpeak I-III, I-V were significantly prolonged among preterm babies (P value < 0. 05). There was a significant increase in absolute latencies I, III, V and IPL I-III among preterm babies with comorbidities (P value < 0. 05). Such difference in latencies was not seen among term babies with comorbidities.
