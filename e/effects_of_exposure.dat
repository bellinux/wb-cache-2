5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and {{everyone}} has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. Of the groups shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic, especially among women and children. Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E

25|$|The RBE of {{different}} types of heavy particles on CNS function and cognitive/behavioral performance was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the thresholds for the HZE particle-induced disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning is shown in figure 6-4; and for the disruption of operant responding is shown in figure 6-5. These figures show a similar pattern of responsiveness to the disruptive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to either 56Fe or 28Si particles on both CTA learning and operant responding. These results suggest that the RBE {{of different}} particles for neurobehavioral dysfunction cannot be predicted {{solely on the basis of}} the LET of the specific particle.|$|E
25|$|Research {{in animals}} {{suggests}} that environmental enrichment aids in recovery from {{an array of}} neurological disorders and cognitive impairments. There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and cognitive reserve, the brain's resistance to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as {{evidence to show that}} humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to HZE nuclei on spatial learning, memory behavior, and {{neuronal}} signaling {{have been}} tested, and threshold doses {{have also been}} considered for such effects. It {{will be important to}} understand the mechanisms that are involved in these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe-ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of studies that investigate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to ozone on health outcomes need to define carefully the methods for the assessment <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> and to determine precisely which is the outcome of biological relevance. The estimation of sample size for longitudinal studies requires the expected rates of change among the exposed and unexposed, the variance of the outcome, and the correlation of measurements taken within an individual. Methods of analysis whose primary interest is in the combination of cross-sectional studies for {{the determination of the}} marginal distribution of the outcome are particularly appropriate for biological processes where the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> is acute. Conditional models are particularly useful for investigating the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> changes in <b>exposure</b> on changes in outcome at the individual level. In addition, conditional models incorporate a dampening <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> that may provide a reasonable agreement with several biological mechanisms. The identification of susceptible individuals and the description of the behavior of their outcomes over time may be better accomplished by using the within-individual variance as the outcome of interest. Discrepancies of the within- and between-individual regressions may be suggestive <b>of</b> chronic <b>effects,</b> and methodological research in this area is needed. Studies <b>of</b> the health <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ozone <b>exposure</b> need to address the incorporation of missing data, measurement error, and the combination of complementary studies. - Environ Health Perspect 101 (Suppl 4) : 231 - 235 (1993).
