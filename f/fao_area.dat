40|$|Possible {{effects of}} the spatial scale of {{analysis}} {{on the relationship between}} fishery landings and the water temperature in the Mediterranean Sea have been investigated using the FAO capture database (1970 - 2010). The analysis was performed by dividing species in three thermal affinity categories: cold, temperate and hot species. Results showed significant changes in fishery landings composition during the last four decades, in terms of the relative contribution of cold, temperate and hot species to landings; moreover, the presence of a strong influence of water warming in determining the landings temporal pattern has been confirmed. This relationship, however, resulted to be not homogenous across the tested spatial scales (entire Mediterranean basin, three main sub-basins, eight <b>FAO</b> <b>areas).</b> The best models (based on the Akaike Information Criterion), were the ones fitted at the finer spatial definition (i. e. the eight <b>FAO</b> <b>areas)</b> for all the three thermal affinity categories.

40|$|South Georgia is a large, old, and {{isolated}} oceanic archipelago in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean. It {{is surrounded by a}} wide continental shelf which is highly productive, rich in biodiversity and one of the world’s largest Marine Protected Areas. Most of its ~ 1450 species live on the seabed, many are endemic or at the edge of their geographic ranges, but are still quite poorly known. This UK overseas territory is administered by the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and its waters are designated Food & Agricultural Organisation (<b>FAO)</b> <b>area</b> 48. 3. They form an important fishing ground for a well established fishery for the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, a high value fish endemic to the Southern Hemisphere. There are many more fishing than scientific vessels visits to South Georgia and fishing boats, deploy lines at locations too steep or rough for most scientific sampling gear. This thesis investigates the potential for this fishery {{to be a source of}} much needed biodiversity information and evaluates how benthic invertebrate bycatch data is collected by fishing observers. After a general introduction, chapter 2 describes and compares the two longline systems (autoline and Spanish system) used around South Georgia. It also investigates how technical changes in the gear imposed through legislation was responsible for one of the best examples worldwide of successful management on reducing seabirds mortality from nearly 6000 birds yearly to almost zero in the recent years. Historical data was used to show how both gear types have evolved and new weighting regimes adopted. Chapter 3 investigated a method to potentially improve collection of benthic bycatch information by observers, by reducing routine workload. An electronic monitoring system (EM) was designed and installed on a longline vessel to record footage of fishing activity. Data collected was compared to that from human observers, which could optimise that during settings by ~ 89 % of the time spent by the observer. Hauling monitoring operations were reduced by ~ 56 %. Species identification agreement across techniques was high for vertebrate, and for some groups of invertebrates, especially larger specimens. For detection of small benthic bycatch the video technique showed clear limitations but with the expected reduction in workload, more time will be available for observers identify through direct collection of VME taxa by the crew during hauling operations. Chapter 4 examines the composition of benthic bycatch particularly those constituting Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) from trials in well known fishing grounds. Bycatch composition collected did not differ with gear type but significantly varied with area and depth. In total 199 taxa were found in the study period, of which 28 represented new records for South Georgia and at least one species of Holothuroidea (Laetmogonidae) was previously undescribed. These new records are compared with previous distribution and maps showing the previous and new range are shown. Chapter 5 shows the spatial and bathymetric distribution of the most important VME groups using information collected by observers. The amount (CPUE) of bycatch of each fishing gear is compared and differed significantly with gear type system where invertebrate bycatch is higher on Spanish than autoline system. The quality of the data collected by these observers are then assessed and compared with longline trials in the same area. Two methods of observation used by observers are also evaluated showing significant differences in CPUE and numbers of VME groups identified. The general findings, implications and recommendations are then given in a general discussion...|$|E

40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in european hakes (Merluccius merluccius) belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from Merluccius merluccius captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from <b>FAO</b> <b>area</b> 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The blue ling (Molva dypterygia), european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|E
40|$|The CCAMLR MPA Workshop on Marine Protected Areas, held in Brest (France) in August 2011, {{recommended}} that the Scientific Committee considers supporting three technical workshops including one specific to Planning Domain 5. Planning Domain 5 includes Marion and Prince Edward Islands, the Del Cano Rise and the Crozet Archipelago in the north. It also includes the Ob and Lena seamounts. The workshop focusing on Planning Domain 5 was held in St Pierre, La Réunion, France from 15 th May to 18 th May, 2012 {{at the headquarters of}} TAAF (French Southern and Antarctic Territories). It followed a meeting on the northern part of Planning Domain 5, which was held in South Africa in 2008, organized and funded by WWF South Africa and known as Del Cano 1. The intention of the CCAMLR workshop was to study the ecological values {{and the use of the}} marine environment and to identify possible threats that might occur in this area. It extended the Del Cano 1 study spatially and also ecologically to include the benthic and pelagic realms. Identification of objectives for Conservation Planning and future research were discussed in relation to national and international projects. Depending on the availability of data, the approach was based on mapping species distributions (either observed data or predictions for species or community presence/abundance based on environmental factors). Various national and international datasets were used including data from CCAMLR. However, South African and French data relevant to the Planning Domain 5 and surrounding domains were a major focus in the workshop because these CCAMLR member nations are the major scientific actors in this region. Species distributions were visualized by the mean of a Geographic Information System. Available Norwegian data from the Bouvetøya region were also discussed, but this region is less studied compared to the Planning Domain 5. The workshop provided benthic and pelagic abiotic classifications of the Planning Domain using geographic and oceanographic features. Distributions of plankton, mesopelagic fish and top predators were consistent with the abiotic regionalization showing latitudinal patterns of communities for the pelagic species. The importance of frontal zones such as the Antarctic Polar Front and especially the Subantarctic Front were highlighted. North of the CCAMLR area, the Agulhas Return Current has a strong influence on this region. The latitudinal zonation of bioregions according to frontal zones may be influenced by climate change. This will have consequences for marine bird and mammal populations as it will change the habitat of their main pelagic prey species (e. g. euphausiids, squids, mesopelagic fish, etc.). The working group concluded that ecoregionalisation has to be conducted at the scale of plateaus which includes Prince Edward Islands, Del Cano Rise and Crozet Islands i. e. a more detailed level than what has been done to date. High productive pelagic areas must be considered in relation to the bathymetry, iron enrichment, fronts and island mass effects, which contrast with high nutrient low chlorophyll areas farther south. Ichtyofauna and benthos were described as being characteristic of the subantarctic zone with some species being endemic. However, cryptic benthic species have not yet been studied. The French and South African islands support substantial colonies of seabirds and seals, which for several species have global importance. For example, the Crozet and Prince Edward Islands together host the entire population of Crozet shag, about 70 % of the world population of wandering albatross, 54 % of king penguin, 33 % of Indian yellow-nosed albatross, 33 % of subantarctic fur seal, 27 % of sooty albatross and 21 % of the world’s southern rockhopper penguin. The high productivity in the vicinity of the islands, together with the large aggregations of seabirds and seals found at the islands, attract various other animals, e. g. several cetaceans, to their vicinity. The populations of several seabirds that breed at the islands have decreased. There is accumulating evidence that decreases of albatrosses and petrels have been substantially influenced by by-catch mortality in fisheries, whereas decreases in some penguins are probably attributable to decreased availability of prey that may have been caused by environmental change. Although the islands themselves enjoy a protected status and fishing is at present excluded within 12 nautical miles of the islands, providing some protection to inshore-foraging species, many of the seabirds and seals range well beyond the immediate precincts of the islands. Some circumnavigate Antarctica and others move to the north well beyond the CCAMLR convention area. Hence, many seabirds and seals are affected by human activities, and almost certainly environmental change, in other CCAMLR domains as well as in regions of the high seas that are administered by other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. In particular the CCAMLR Planning domains that neighbour Domain 5 are of importance, as is the southern region of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC, <b>FAO</b> <b>Area</b> 51). Human activities in these other areas adversely influence the conservation status of animals from Planning Domain 5, as is the case with by-catch mortality, it will be necessary for CCAMLR to work in close association with other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (e. g. IOTC), treaties (e. g. Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, ACAP) and conservation organisations (e. g. BirdLife International) to achieve a favourable conservation status for species that are at present Threatened or Near Threatened. The problem is sometimes compounded by albatrosses and petrels segregating their at-sea distributions by sex or age or both, so that components of populations may suffer particularly high mortality leading, e. g., to sex imbalances or inadequate recruitment into breeding populations. Preliminary models suggest that both topographical (e. g. plateau and rises) and oceanographic (e. g. locations of fronts) features play important roles in defining good foraging grounds for some wide-ranging predators. Whereas topographical features are permanent, the locations of oceanographic features may be changing, thereby presenting a greater challenge for spatial conservation planning. For some albatrosses (notably Thalassarche spp.) and penguins (notably Eudyptes spp.) there is accumulating evidence that populations and species may segregate their feeding grounds, which also will need to be accounted for in any form of spatial conservation planning. The Working group noted set of preliminary strategic points essential to Systematic Conservation Planning, which include accounting for ecological relationships with surrounding areas (Bouvet to the West, Kerguelen to the East and East Antarctica to the South). The working group concluded that subtropical areas north of the Planning Domain 5 should be included in the planning, because of the spatial range covered by top predators, and also because the limit of the CCAMLR area cuts across the EEZs of both the Prince Edward and the Crozet Islands, as well as the Del Cano Rise. Strategic points include: First of all, biodiversity features needed to be mapped. The workshop concentrated on this objective most of the time. Second, biodiversity targets need to be determined. France will see how to adapt the ones that were used by Lombard et al. (2007) for the EEZ of the Prince Edward Islands, to the Crozet Islands. For the high seas, the working group {{recommended that}} the definition of targets should be discussed by EMM and the MPA circumpolar workshop. Third, the Working Group started to evaluate pressures and areas of research that need to be defined (spawning and nursery areas, bycatch, interactions with killer whales, etc.). The involvement of stakeholders was discussed, including fishing industries, NGOs, other relevant treaties and CCAMLR members for the high sea areas. This general theme has to be more specifically discussed during the circumpolar workshop and at the SC. The workshop also considered MPAs existing under national jurisdiction in the Planning Domain, procedures to extend them, and the need for strengthened cooperation between CCAMLR and other relevant legal instruments, organizations and initiatives. To achieve these goals, research and monitoring were discussed under three headings: (1) census of biodiversity, (2) ecoregionalisation classification and (3) monitoring. Such research would make up for a current lack of data, e. g. with regard to the benthos (deep and shallow), the mesopelagic zone and plankton. With regard to monitoring ecological processes, especially at the northern limits of the CCAMLR area, CCAMLR may wish to broaden the lists of species and environmental parameters that are monitored, to consider parameters of species that may best reflect change associated with global warming and, if necessary, develop protocols for any new parameters to be monitored. This would naturally include the use of the Continuous Plankton Recorder and tracking for birds, seals and mammals...|$|E

In this study, genetic variation, diversity and population structure of E. tetradactylum among four <b>FAO</b> fishing <b>areas,</b> along South Asian countries, were evaluated using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Totally 30 sequences of COI gene were collected from four <b>FAO</b> fishing <b>areas.</b> Among these 30 individuals, 18 distinct haplotypes were defined. High levels of haplotype diversity (hd = 0. 952 ± 0. 096) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0. 01536 ± 0. 00312) were observed in the population within the Bay of Bengal. No haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed in South China Sea population. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 0. 81 % of the genetic variation occurred within the populations, while 7. 09 % variation occurred among populations. Significant genealogical branches were recognized in North Australian populations (one clade), South China Sea populations (one clade), Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal populations (one clade) on the neighbor-joining tree.

The plan suggests directives on ways of introducing measures into all <b>FAO's</b> <b>areas</b> of activity that will recognize both the role and particular problems of women. FAO has now published a shortened version of it in an attempt to increase awareness of this issue as widely as possible. The plan defines four areas for action: the legal status of women, their economic and social positions, and their role in decision-taking. In each of these areas the plan recommends action to be taken in order to remove the barriers which prevent women from taking a full part in the development process, as well as those that prevent them developing their ability to do so.

40|$|Cephalopod {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the few still with some local potential for expansion; in fact, as groundfish landings have declined globally, cephalopod landings have increased. We propose the hypothesis that, although increased cephalopod landings may partly reflect increased market demand, overfishing groundfish stocks has positively affected cephalopod populations. Data from 15 key <b>FAO</b> <b>areas</b> reveal that, {{with the exception of}} the north- east Atlantic, cephalopod landings have increased significantly over the last 25 years while groundfish have risen more slowly, remained stable, or declined. In terms of volume, cephalopods have not replaced groundfish. This is hypothesized as owing to the shorter life cycle of cephalopods, and rapid turnover and lower standing stocks than for longer-lived finfish species. Under high fishing pressure, groundfish are probably poor competitors, having less opportunity for spawning and replacement. In West Africa, the Gulf of Thailand and Adriatic there is strong circumstantial evidence that fishing pressure has changed ecological conditions and cephalopod stocks have increased as predatory fish have declined. We recommend that this hypothesis be tested thoroughly in other areas where suitable data exist. Most coastal and shelf cephalopod fisheries are likely to be fully exploited or overexploited, and current annual fluctuations in cephalopod landings are probably largely environmentally-driven...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{competition}} between fisheries and marine mammals in the Pacific Ocean was estimated for 7 statistical areas {{defined by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Catch statistics compiled from FAO sources show {{that the amount of}} fish caught in the Pacific Ocean rose from 2 million tons in the late- 1940 s to over 50 million tons in the early- 1990 s. Recent stagnation and declines occurring in some areas of the Pacific suggest that Pacific fisheries cannot continue to expand as they had previously. Based on estimates of population size, total biomass and daily consumption rates, it was estimated that the 84 species of marine mammals inhabiting the Pacific Ocean con-sume about three times as much food as humans harvest. A large fraction (> 60 %) of the food caught by marine mammals consisted of deep sea squids and very small deep sea fishes not harvestable by humans, thus limiting the extent of direct competition between fisheries and marine mammals. Moreover, the most important consumers of commercially exploited fish are other predatory fish, not marine mammals. Although direct competition between fisheries and marine mammals for prey appears rather limited, there may be considerable indirect competition for primary production. The primary production required to sustain marine mammals in each of the 7 <b>FAO</b> <b>areas</b> varies within a narrow range, suggesting that the diversity and abundance of marine mam-mals may have slowly evolved to fully exploit their niche and maximize their use of avail-able primary production. This contrasts with the rapid expansion of fisheries and their relatively recent dependence on primary production, which may have led to what we call 'food web competition'...|$|R
