25|$|The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, <b>Hepatology,</b> and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found {{evidence}} to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased {{in the number of}} bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no {{evidence to support}} major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.|$|E
