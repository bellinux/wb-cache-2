6000|$|... "Don't you mind," [...] said Miss Asher. [...] "Well, it's because--well, I didn't {{think you}} were that kind when I first saw you. But you are all like. And now will you take me home, or will <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a cop?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for me, since I cannot see myself, {{particularly}} if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> you Mrs. Conolly. If I may call you Marian, as I used to do, I {{think that our}} conversation will contain fewer reminders of the lapse of time." ...|$|E

"Reefer Headed Woman" [...] - [...] "'Reefer Head Woman' was a 1940s blues record. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the lyrics}} in a {{notebook}} that got stolen, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Dr. Demento from the Record Plant, where we finished the album, and the Doctor read the lyrics to me over the phone." ...|$|R

Get ye gone, all of you!--or shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{the guard and}} have you all whipped {{for a set of}} dastardly cowards, eh? [...] . . . Or better still, hanged, as your leader and friend here suggests--what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Lyons," [...] said I, as I {{rose from}} this long and {{inconclusive}} interview, [...] "you {{are taking a}} very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in {{the aid of the}} police you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not too}} late. It beats, though but feebly. All {{our work}} is undone. We must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on you {{yourself}} this time, friend John." [...] As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and producing the instruments of transfusion. I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was too quick. It {{looked as}} if he didn't want me to see him, and I rode on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Forrester's and I found Corporal Slaney there. One or two things he said {{made it clear that he}} hadn't the faintest notion that Winthrop was within a mile or two of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It did, ma'am, it did," [...] {{said the}} burglar. [...] "I made a vow that night that if ever again <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{in any one}} to help me in {{business}} of that kind I wouldn't go pards with him. I'd pay him {{so much for the}} job, and I'd take the risks, and I've stuck to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't think it a liberty," [...] Jacob said simply, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Tate's <b>to</b> {{get one of}} mine which I'd <b>had</b> restrung, and <b>I</b> saw such a delightfully {{balanced}} lady's racquet that I ventured to bring it down.

6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> your {{attention}} to is this Arthur Heigham plot. At first it may appear that I am involved with you; I am not. There is not, now that George Caresfoot is dead, one tittle of evidence against me except your own, and who will believe you? You are inculpated up to the eyes; you delivered the forged letter, I can prove that you cozened the ring out of Heigham, and you told Philip: there is no escape for you, and I have already taken an opportunity to renounce any responsibility for your acts. At the inquest I shall appear to give evidence against you, and then I shall abandon you to your fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know, my dear, it won't be {{even out}} of my way, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Mr. Malpas's office, and I can go there from the hotel in Regent Street.' This was all news to Stephen. She {{did not know that}} her aunt had {{intended}} going to London; and indeed she did not know of any business with Mr. Malpas, whose firm had been London solicitor to the Rowlys for several generations. She had no doubt, however, as to the old lady's intention. It was plain to her that she wanted to help. So she thanked her sweetly. Leonard could say nothing. He seemed to be left completely out of it. When Stephen rose, as a hint to him {{that it was time for}} him to go, he said humbly, as he left: ...|$|E
6000|$|At last, liveried in {{the costume}} of the age, Reality {{entered the room}} {{in the shape of}} a servant to tell the Duchess that her {{carriage}} was waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. [...] "How annoying!" [...] she cried. [...] "I must go. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair. If I am late, he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful, and dreadfully demoralising. I am sure I don't know what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{voice had}} an accent of forced bravery {{in it and}} I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my heart <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always despised him a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{struck a}} slave girl {{who stood in}} my way," [...] the captain said, [...] "and he came at me so {{suddenly}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon the men to bind him. He threw one of them overboard, and with his naked hands knocked down two others; and, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told you, it took all the efforts of eight or ten more before they could overcome him." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} from eS to Nike was—after I got through making the phone call—I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Koston; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call,</b> you know, Tony at eS; <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{a few people}} 'cause we were close; we were good family over there. So, after I got through that hard part, and I could just, and I was free of that burden, then when I got on Nike, it was just, like, the world was opened up—it was insane.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may mean}} something, {{and it may}} not," [...] the Squire said, as he handed the letter to Mark. [...] "It is a {{suspicious}} looking circumstance; if the fellow had been honest he would surely have said something about himself. There is no doubt these housebreakers generally find out what chance there is of resistance, and, hearing that we were both away, may have decided on making an attempt. I have pretty well finished our business and ordered nearly all the provisions that Mrs. Cunningham requires. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at my lawyer's, and that is generally a longish business. It is half past two o'clock now; if we start from here at five we shall be down soon after eight, which will be quite soon enough. We shall {{have a couple of}} hours' drive in the dark, but that won't matter, we have got the lamps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, I {{dare say}} you were, Mr. Blenkinsopp,' the doctor {{answered}} blandly, {{with just the}} faintest tinge of unconscious satire, peering at his square unintelligent features as a fancier peers at {{the face of a}} bull-dog; 'I dare say you were now. After all, however clever a set of boys may be, one of them MUST be {{at the bottom of the}} form, in the nature of things, mustn't he? And your Charlie, I think, is only fifteen. Ah, yes; well, well; he'll do better, no doubt, if we keep him here a year or two longer. So then there's the second: Guy, you call him, if I remember right--Cyril Anastasius Guy--our Blenkinsopp minor. Guy's a good boy; an excellent boy: to tell you the plain truth, Mr. Blenkinsopp, I don't know much of him personally myself, which is a fact that tells greatly in his favour. Charlie I must admit <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> up some times for reproof: Guy, never. Charlie's in the fifth form: Guy's seventh in the fourth. A capital place for a boy of his age! He's very industrious, you know--what we call a plodder. They call it a plodder, you see, at thirteen, Mr. Blenkinsopp, but a man of ability at forty.' Dr. Greatrex delivered that last effective shot point-blank at the eyes of the inquiring parent, and felt in a moment that its delicate generalised flattery had gone home straight to the parent's susceptible heart.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{he went to}} bed, Caldigate {{wrote to}} his wife {{as he had done}} also on the {{preceding}} evening. 'There is to be another long, tedious, terrible day, and then it may be that I shall be able to write no more. For your sake, almost more than for my own, I am longing for it to be over. It would be vain for me to attempt to tell you all that took place. I do not dare to give you hope which I know may be fallacious. And yet I feel my own heart somewhat higher than it was when I wrote last night.' Then he did tell her something of what had taken place, speaking in high praise of Sir John Joram. 'And now my own, own wife, my real wife, my beloved one, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> you so, perhaps for the last time for years. If these men shall choose to think that I married that woman, we shall have to be so parted {{that it would be better}} for us to be in our graves. But even then I will not give up all hope. My father has promised that the whole colony shall be ransacked till proof be found of the truth. And then, though I shall have been convicted, I shall be reinstated in my position as your husband. May God Almighty bless you, and our boy, till I may come again to claim my wife and my child without disgrace.' ...|$|E
60|$|I've often {{wondered}} since then how these murderer fellows manage {{to keep in}} shape while they're contemplating their next effort. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a much simpler sort of job on hand, {{and the thought of}} it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next day. Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on Jeeves <b>to</b> rally round with one of those life-savers of his.|$|R
6000|$|So {{presently}} we {{came back}} home, and I spent many busy days in fixing and arranging our new house. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the drawing-room done in blue, and the dining-room all in dark panelled wood, and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white enamel to match my bedroom and dressing-room. There {{was a very nice}} little room in the basement next to the coal cellar that I turned into a [...] "den" [...] for John, so that when he wanted to smoke he could go down there and do it. John seemed to appreciate his den at once, and often would stay down there so long that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> him to come up.|$|R
50|$|After {{a series}} of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian State came close {{to the brink of}} collapse. Thus, the new young emperor Franz Joseph <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for Russian help {{in the name of the}} Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 {{auxiliary}} forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR BAXTER,-- ...

The blind Plugson: he was a Captain of Industry, born member of the Ultimate genuine Aristocracy of this Universe, could he have known it! These thousand men that span and toiled round him, they were a regiment whom he had enlisted, man by man; to make war on a very genuine enemy: Bareness of back, and disobedient Cotton-fibre, which will not, unless forced to it, consent to cover bare backs. Here is a most genuine enemy; over whom all creatures will wish him victory. He enlisted his thousand men; said to them, [...] "Come, brothers, let us have a dash at Cotton!" [...] They follow with cheerful shout; they gain such a victory over Cotton as the Earth has to admire and clap hands at: but, alas, it is yet only of the Bucanier or Chactaw sort,--as good as no victory! Foolish Plugson of St. Dolly Undershot: does he hope to become illustrious by hanging up the scalps in his wigwam, the hundred thousands at his banker's, and saying, Behold my scalps? Why, Plugson, even thy own host is all in mutiny: Cotton is conquered; but the 'bare backs'--are worse covered than ever! Indomitable Plugson, thou must cease to be a Chactaw; thou and others; thou thyself, if no other! ...|$|E
