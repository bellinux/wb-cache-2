40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the extent to which weather index-based {{insurances}} can contribute to reducing shortfall risks of revenues of a representative average farm that produces corn or wheat in the North China Plain (NCP). The <b>geographical</b> basis <b>risk</b> is quantified to analyze the spatial dependency of weather patterns between established weather stations in the area and locations where the local weather patterns are unknown. Design/methodology/approach – Data are based on the Statistical Yearbook of China and the Chinese Meteorological Administration. Methods of insurance valuation are burn analysis and index value simulation. Risk reduction is measured non-parametrically and parametrically by the change of the standard deviation and the value at risk of revenues. The <b>geographical</b> basis <b>risk</b> is quantified by setting up a decorrelation function. Findings – Results suggest significant differences in the potential risk reduction between corn and wheat when using insurance based on a precipitation index. The spatial analysis suggests a potential to expand the insurance around a reference weather station up to community level. Research limitations/implications – Findings are limited by a weak database in China and, in particular, by the unavailability of individual farm data. Moreover, the low density of weather stations currently limits the examination of the approach in a broader context. Practical implications – The risk reduction potential of the proposed insurance is encouraging. From a policy point of view, the approach used here can support the adjustment of insurers towards different crops. Originality/value – This paper is believed to be the first that investigates a weather index-based insurance designed for an average farm in the NCP and the quantification of <b>geographical</b> basis <b>risk.</b> Agriculture, China, Grain production, Risk management, Weather index-based insurance, Weather risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of drought is serious in many landscapes with continental patterns of climate. In fact, drought risk is usually assessed {{in terms of}} prevailing issue (meteorological, hydrological, agronomical, etc.) and {{not in terms of}} complex landscape features. A procedure for detailed <b>geographical</b> drought <b>risk</b> modelling has been developed using recent meteorological data of dry period and prior precipitations, as well as a digital elevation model and geographic data layers of natural landscape features and land cover. The current version of the procedure starts with meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) processing followed by the use of soil and geological data and land cover, the national CORINE LC 2006 CZ database, for assessing the impact of the local natural features on drought risk. The methodology is based on GIS tools, geodata of the geological structure of the area (water holding capacity of the substrate, the horizontal and vertical water conductivity), soil cover (in agricultural and forested areas, soil types and kinds), landscape cover (land use), relief (digital elevation model and its derivatives), temperature and precipitation data from neighbouring representative meteorological and climate stations. The procedure uses regression equation for temperature and precipitation risk modelling, fuzzy standardization for estimation of different water retention within land cover categories and expert estimation for risk categories within rocks and soils. The final calculation is based on spatial decision-making techniques, especially the weighted sum method with a natural breaks reclassification algorithm. Combining geodata of soils, the geological environment and the active surface with their computed humidity conditions, it is possible to identify areas with a graded risk of geographic drought.

Lung cancer in women is the cancer mortality cause that has increased most in the CV during the period 1991 to 2000. Moreover, the geographical distribution of risk from this cause in the CV has been previously described and a non-homogenous pattern was determined. The present paper studies the spatio-temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality for women in the CV during the period 1987 – 2004, in order to gain some insight into the factors, such as migration, that have had an influence on these changes. Methods A novel methodology, consisting of a Bayesian hierarchical model, is used in this paper. Such a model allows the handling of data with a very high disaggregation, {{while at the same time}} taking advantage of its spatial and temporal structure. Results The spatio-temporal pattern which was found points to geographical differences in the time trends of risk. In fact, the southern coastal side of the CV has had a higher increase in risk, coinciding with the settlement of a large foreign community in that area, mainly comprised of elderly people from the European Union. Conclusion Migration has frequently been ignored as a risk factor in the description of the <b>geographical</b> <b>risk</b> of lung cancer and it is suggested that this factor should be considered, especially in tourist regions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{proceeding}} globalization {{leads to}} growing {{and more and}} more complex company networks. Especially for the production industry the high cost pressure forces companies to spread their production sites over the globe. Low labour costs, distances to potential markets and productivity influences lead onto complex decision situations for managers in charge. Beside the total landed costs to produce the product portfolio, the global footprint decisions are influenced by other dimensions as well. Since it was possible to improve global footprint design decisions by an evolutionary algorithm with the web tool OptiWo, this paper specifies an approach to quantitatively implement risk management as the second dimension of these decisions. With the distribution of production sites over the globe the companies are getting more and more exposed to different potential global risks. Additionaly, the actual political situation of crisis around the world as well as geological disasters stroked the fears of losses. Finally risk-averse companies try to get an analysis on political and <b>geographical</b> <b>risks</b> for the particular footprint they are designing. The approach consists of two basic elements of a typical risk analysis: Firstly, the risk as the feasibility of a political or geological event causing a production blackout in a site is rated for every site. This risk rating is generated by professionals in this specific field. Secondly, the impact of a blackout of a specific site of a network has to be rated. Finally, these two risk dimensions are combined to get a specific footprint risk level. The approach is standardized to allow an integration into the existing tool to make the risk analysis of a global production network efficient and automatically useable. Due to this achievement managers are able to overview another dimension of global footprint design decisions efficiently. A validation of our approach is presented using a data set of a recently conducted industry project. Different network scenarios of a global manufacturer in the automation industry are compared to point out different characteristics of global footprint risks...|$|R
40|$|On 12 May, 2008, {{a devastating}} {{earthquake}} registering 8. 0 on the Richter scale occurred in Sichuan Province, China, taking {{tens of thousands}} of lives and destroying the homes of millions of people. Many of the deceased were children, particular children less than five years old who were more vulnerable to such a huge disaster than the adult. In order to obtain information specifically relevant to further researches and future preventive measures, potential risk factors associated with earthquake-related child mortality need to be identified. We used four <b>geographical</b> detectors (<b>risk</b> detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) based on spatial variation analysis of some potential factors to assess their effects on the under-five mortality. It was found that three factors are responsible for child mortality: earthquake intensity, collapsed house, and slope. The study, despite some limitations, has important implications for both researchers and policy makers...|$|R
