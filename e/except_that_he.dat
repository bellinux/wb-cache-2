5|$|Pausanias' account {{agrees with}} that of Herodotus (whom he {{probably}} read) <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again {{before returning to the}} restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> said he was the one, not Laura, who had objected to the shotgun being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Plegmund <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was of Mercian descent. A later tradition, dating 300 years after his death, stated that Plegmund lived as a hermit at Plemstall in Cheshire. His {{reputation}} as a scholar {{attracted the attention of}} King Alfred the Great, who was trying to revive scholarship. Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court. There he worked with three other scholars, Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, Æthelstan and Wærwulf in working on translating Pope Gregory the Great's treatise Pastoral Care into Old English.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Kapena's early life <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was born into a}} family from the lesser strata of Hawaiian nobility, {{subordinate}} to the high chiefs or aliʻi nui. In 1831, he {{became a member of the}} first class of the Lahainaluna Seminary under American missionary Lorrin Andrews, the school's first principal. His classmates included historian David Malo and Samuel Kamakau and politicians Boaz Mahune and Timothy Haʻalilio. He graduated in 1835 after four years in the school.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E

5|$|William de Corbeil or William of Corbeil (c. 1070– 1136) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Very {{little is known}} of William's early life or his family, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born at Corbeil in the {{outskirts}} of Paris {{and that he had}} two brothers. Educated as a theologian, he taught briefly before serving the bishops of Durham and London as a clerk and subsequently becoming a canon, a priest who lived a communal life. William was elected to the see of Canterbury as a compromise candidate in 1123, the first canon to become an English archbishop. He succeeded Ralph d'Escures, who had employed him as a chaplain.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance {{and the advent of}} the first English translation of the Iliad in the form of Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E
5|$|Singaporeans are {{encouraged}} to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, {{without the need for}} the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.|$|E

5|$|Solomon was born, {{probably}} circa 480/490, in {{the fortress}} of Idriphthon {{in the district}} of Solachon, near Dara in the province of Mesopotamia. He was a eunuch {{as a result of an}} accident during his infancy, not from deliberate castration. Solomon had a brother, Bacchus, who became a priest. Bacchus fathered three sons, Cyrus, Sergius and Solomon, who later became military officers in Africa under their uncle; Sergius also succeeded Solomon as governor of Africa after the latter's death. Little is known of Solomon's early career, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> served under the dux Mesopotamiae Felicissimus, perhaps as early as the latter's installment to the post in 505/506. Certainly by 527, when he came to the service of General Belisarius, Solomon was considered an experienced officer. It is perhaps at this time that he was named Belisarius's domesticus, or chief-of-staff, the post with which he is mentioned by the historian Procopius in 533, before the onset of the campaign against the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{found that}} Pećanac's units were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military}} aid to them. Pećanac's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries such as the Serbian State Guard and Serbian Volunteer Command and also with Mihailović's Chetniks. The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942, and all but one had been dissolved {{by the end of}} that year. The last detachment was disbanded in March 1943. His followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces, German labour units, or were interned in prisoner-of-war camps. Many deserted to join Mihailović. Nothing is recorded of Pećanac's activities in the months that followed <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government.|$|E

5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E
