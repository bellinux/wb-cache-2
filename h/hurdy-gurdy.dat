5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} synopsis differs from the actual production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the <b>hurdy-gurdy.</b> The organ grinder does not play a <b>hurdy-gurdy.</b> In the published synopsis the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The band plays guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, {{mandolin}} and <b>hurdy-gurdy,</b> {{and takes}} {{most of these}} instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas are}} {{reflected}} in the arrangement and composition of the album, which lead to a sound of dread and dissonance. The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound; in addition to the orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a <b>hurdy-gurdy,</b> mandolin, accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E

25|$|The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamhúr(ok)) are {{stopped with}} tangents {{attached}} to keys {{that change the}} vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest <b>hurdy-gurdies</b> these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, {{it is possible to}} tune <b>hurdy-gurdies</b> to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary <b>hurdy-gurdies</b> have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.|$|R
5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (<b>hurdy-gurdy)</b> is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century {{changing}} musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities {{than the}} <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German Bauernleier 'peasant's lyre' and Bettlerleier 'beggar's lyre.' During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> back {{to the attention of the}} upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the <b>hurdy-gurdy.</b> The most famous of these is Nicolas Chédeville's Il pastor Fido, attributed to Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> developed, the six-string vielle à roue. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} {{came into}} a new public consciousness when Donovan released his hit pop song, Hurdy Gurdy Man, in 1968. Although the song didn't use a <b>hurdy-gurdy,</b> the repeated reference to the instrument in the song's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people, eventually resulting in an annual <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> music festival in the Olympic Peninsula area {{of the state of}} Washington each September.|$|E

25|$|In {{recollections}} {{long after}} the frontiers closed, writers such as Wyatt Earp and E.C. Abbott referred to honky-tonks in the cowtowns of Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana in the 1870s and 1880s. Their recollections contain lurid accounts {{of the women and}} violence accompanying the shows. However, in contemporary accounts these were nearly always called <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> shows, possibly derived from the term <b>hurdy-gurdy,</b> which was sometimes mistakenly applied to a small, portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} Renaissance, two {{characteristic}} shapes of <b>hurdy-gurdies</b> developed. The first was guitar-shaped {{and the second}} had a rounded lute-type body made of staves. The lute-like body is especially characteristic of French instruments.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese multi-instrumentalist and {{experimental}} musical instrument builder Yuichi Onoue developed a two string <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> like a fretless violin, called the Kaisatsuko, {{as well as}} a deeply scalloped electric guitar for microtonal playing techniques.|$|E
25|$|Skempton's {{first major}} success came in 1991 with {{the premiere of}} Lento (1990), an orchestral piece that gained a larger {{audience}} for the composer. During the 1990s and the 2000s Skempton started composing longer works for larger forces. These include several concertos, among which are some for instruments rarely used in the western tradition: the <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> (Concerto for <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> and percussion (1994)) and the accordion (Concerto for oboe, accordion and strings (1997)). Some of the later works explore non-standard instrumentation: Alveston (2007) is scored for four trumpets, Horizons (2001) is scored for oboe and harp, Ballade (1997) is a pieces for saxophone quartet and string orchestra.|$|E

25|$|The <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> is the {{instrument}} played by Der Leiermann, the street musician {{portrayed in the}} last, melancholy song of Schubert's Winterreise.

25|$|Leopold Mozart {{was much}} {{concerned}} with a naturalistic feel to his compositions, his Jagdsinfonie (or Sinfonia da Caccia for four horns and strings) calls for shotguns, and his Bauernhochzeit (Peasant Wedding) includes bagpipes, <b>hurdy-gurdy,</b> a dulcimer, whoops and whistles (ad. lib.), and pistol shots.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in Italian music {{led to his}} receiving, in August 1739, a privilege to publish arrangements for the musette, <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> or flute of concertos and sonatas by ten specific Italian composers, in addition to Johann Joachim Quantz and Antoine Mahaut. Le printems, ou Les saisons amusantes (1739) is a particularly amusing result of this privilege; it is an arrangement of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons for <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> or musette, violin, and flute (though the French flute could also mean the recorder). He replaced Vivaldi's original Summer with his op. 8 no. 9 concerto, transferred the middle movement of Winter to Autumn, and replaced Winter op. 8 no. 12. All this was quite freely arranged and combined with some added Vivaldian material by Chédeville.|$|E

He constructed a separate plant at Goundry and Oliver Streets in downtown North Tonawanda specializing in short production runs to fabricate organs and <b>hurdy-gurdys</b> for amusement parks, circuses, roller rinks, and carnival midways. Amusement rides, particularly carousels, were also assembled at the facility.|$|R

25|$|Baroque {{instruments}} {{included some}} instruments {{from the earlier}} periods (e.g., the <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> and recorder) {{and a number of}} new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the violin, viol, viola, viola d'amore, cello, contrabass, lute, theorbo (which often played the basso continuo parts), mandolin, cittern, Baroque guitar, harp and <b>hurdy-gurdy.</b> Woodwinds included the Baroque flute, Baroque oboe, rackett, recorder and the bassoon. Brass instruments included the cornett, natural horn, Baroque trumpet, serpent and the trombone. Keyboard instruments included the clavichord, the harpsichord, the pipe organ, and, later in the period, the fortepiano (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the timpani, snare drum, tambourine and the castanets.|$|E
25|$|His two prints with a <b>hurdy-gurdy</b> man {{come from}} a very {{different}} world of genre works and realism, and {{the violence of the}} larger one was original at the time, anticipating themes to be taken up in later decades by the slightly younger Lorraine artist Jacques Callot and others.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese yazheng and yaqin, and Korean ajaeng zithers are {{generally}} played by [...] "bowing" [...] with a rosined stick, which creates friction against the strings without any horsehair. The <b>hurdy-gurdy's</b> strings are similarly set into vibration {{by means of}} a [...] "rosin wheel," [...] a wooden wheel which contacts the strings as it is rotated {{by means of a}} crank handle, creating a [...] "bowed" [...] tone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composer}} Joseph Boismortier was counted {{among his}} friends. Naudot's most widely available work is his flute concerto opus 17, number 5. His other works include [...] "babioles" [...] (baubles, trifles, toys) published about 1750. These are easy duets, {{described as being}} suitable for vielles (<b>hurdy-gurdies)</b> and musettes (bagpipes). The word [...] "babiole" [...] has not caught on in music circles, and later composers preferred the word Divertimento.|$|R
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical <b>hurdy-gurdies</b> allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|R
