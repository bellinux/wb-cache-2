50|$|Acebutolol {{undergoes}} extensive hepatic metabolization {{resulting in}} the desbutyl amine acetolol which is readily converted into <b>diacetolol.</b> <b>Diacetolol</b> is as active as acebutolol (equipotency) and appears {{to have the same}} pharmacologic profile. Geriatric patients tend to have higher peak plasma levels of both acebutolol and <b>diacetolol</b> and a slightly prolonged excretion. Excretion is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment, and so a dose reduction may be needed. Liver cirrhosis does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug and metabolite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diacetolol</b> is {{the primary}} {{metabolite}} of acebutolol. It is an beta blocker and anti-arrhythmic agent.|$|E
50|$|Acebutolol is well absorbed {{from the}} GI tract, but {{undergoes}} substantial first-pass-metabolization, {{leading to a}} bioavailability of only 35% to 50%. Peak plasma levels of acebutolol are reached within 2 to 2.5 hours after oral dosing. Peak levels of the main active metabolite, <b>diacetolol,</b> are reached after 4 hours. Acebutolol has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours, and <b>diacetolol</b> a half-life of 8 to 13 hours.|$|E
40|$|Acebutolol was {{administered}} orally {{in a single}} dose of 200 mg to 17 individuals whose renal function varied markedly. The plasma half-life and elimination rate constant for acebutolol showed a four-fold variation but these did not correlate with the degree of renal impairment. However, {{there was a good}} correlation between the renal clearance of creatinine and that of acebutolol (P less than 0. 001). The half-life and elimination rate of the acetyl metabolite, <b>diacetolol,</b> were subject to 10 -fold inter-individual variability which correlated significantly with the creatinine clearance and serum creatinine concentration. The AUC for the acetyl metabolite showed a 40 -fold individual variation which also correlated with renal function. It is concluded that renal elimination is the principal route of excretion for <b>diacetolol</b> but not the parent compound, acebutolol...|$|E
40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} were randomly allocated into treatment or placebo groups. The treatment group received a single 400 mg oral dose of acebutolol, {{the placebo group}} an identical inert prepation. A blood sample from each patient was subsequently analysed for plasma concentrations of acebutolol and <b>diacetolol,</b> and the electrocardiogram was continuously monitored for changes of rate and rhythm. The plasma concentrations of acebutolol and <b>diacetolol</b> were all above the previously reported minimum levels for effective dysrhythmia control and the nine patients in whom irregularities of rhythm occurred {{were all in the}} placebo group. One patient in the treatment group, who was 58 years old, required intravenous injection of atropine for bradycardia and hypotension after induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that in patients with small body weights and in those patients over 50 years of age the predmedication dose of acebutolol should be reduced to 200 mg...|$|E
40|$|Five beta-adrenoceptor blockers, propranolol, acebutolol, diacebutolol, {{atenolol}} and bisoprolol, {{were tested}} for their antagonistic effect against isoprenaline on human isolated bronchi. The results showed (1) that only propranolol exerted a competitive antagonistic effect against isoprenaline (pA 2 = 9. 40 +/- 0. 22, n = 7) {{whereas the other}} drugs did not, and (2) that, {{in the presence of}} beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the plasma concentrations reported after a single usual therapeutic dose, the doses of isoprenaline giving the same bronchodilator effect must be multiplied by 32. 6, 5. 51, 4. 63, 2. 82 and 1. 95 respectively with propranolol, <b>diacetolol,</b> acebutolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol. It was concluded that (1) atenolol and bisoprolol were the least potent drugs at bronchial level in therapeutic plasma concentrations and (2) that tests performed on the human isolated bronchus might be a useful screening procedure for new drugs with potential activity on the airways...|$|E
40|$|Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral β-adrenergic {{blocking}} drug, {{which is}} useful clinically as the racemate in treating hypertension and is metabolized to an equipotent chiral metabolite, <b>diacetolol</b> (DC). In this paper we report {{a case of}} a 32 year old woman who was receiving AC during her pregnancy and lactating time for management of hypertension. The maternal plasma level and breast milk as well as cord blood collected to see whether the drug is transferred to thefetus through the mother stereoselectively. A stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was used to measure the enantiomeric concentrations of AC and DC. AC and DC enantiomers are stereoselectively excreted into the milk, although theconcentrations of DC enantiomers were higher than those of AC. AC concentrations were very low in both cord artery and vein samples four hours after taking the drug however, the stereoselective concentrations of metabolite, DC, was found in these samples. In conclusion, AC and DC enantiomers are excreted in human breast milk in concentrations much higher than that in maternal plasma. Furthermore, DC was found in the infant’s plasma indicating that accumulation of metabolite did occur in this infant...|$|E
