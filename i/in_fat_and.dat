5|$|Beef is an {{excellent}} source of zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins. Bison meat is lower <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> cholesterol than beef, but has a higher protein content.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables can {{be eaten}} either raw or cooked and play an {{important}} role in human nutrition, being mostly low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pig meat is high {{in protein}} and low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> cholesterol, and is {{described}} as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
50|$|Osmium tetraoxide {{is used in}} optical {{microscopy}} to stain lipids. It dissolves <b>in</b> <b>fats,</b> <b>and</b> is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.|$|R
50|$|Bixin is soluble <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> {{alcohols}} but insoluble in water. Upon {{exposure to}} alkali, the methyl ester is hydrolyzed {{to produce the}} dicarboxylic acid norbixin, a water-soluble derivative.|$|R
50|$|Ethanol is not {{the only}} product created during production. By-products also have energy content. Corn is {{typically}} 66% starch and the remaining 33% is not fermented. This unfermented component is called distillers grain, which is high <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> proteins, and makes a good animal feed supplement.|$|R
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winterâ€“ by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> digestible carbohydrates, {{and high in}} protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

50|$|Sudan Yellow a3G, {{also known}} as Solvent Yellow 16, C.I. {{disperse}} yellow and C.I. 12700, is a yellow azo dye. Chemically it is 4-phenylazo-1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone or 2,4-dihydro-5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-(phenylazo)-3H-pyrazol-3-on. It is soluble <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils.|$|R
50|$|Nutritionally, the kernel {{is high in}} manganese, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium, <b>and</b> rich <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> protein. It {{yields a}} light {{yellowish}} oil, mainly of glycerides of oleic (44.4 to 59.6%) and palmitic acids (32.6 to 38.2%).|$|R
50|$|The double bonds found <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils {{play a role}} in autoxidation. Oils with a {{high degree}} of {{unsaturation}} are most susceptible to autoxidation. The best test for autoxidation (oxidative rancidity) is determination of the peroxide value. Peroxides are intermediates in the autoxidation reaction.|$|R
25|$|Turkey bacon is {{a popular}} {{alternative}} to bacon. People may choose turkey bacon over real bacon due to health benefits, religious laws, or other reasons. It is lower <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> food energy than bacon, but {{may be used in}} a similar manner (such as in a BLT sandwich).|$|E
25|$|Whitefish such as haddock and cod {{are very}} low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> {{calories}} which, combined with oily fish rich in Omega-3 such as mackerel, sardines, fresh tuna, salmon and trout, {{can help to}} protect against coronary heart disease, as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.|$|E
25|$|They are {{especially}} suitable for tilling rice fields, and their milk is richer <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein {{than that of}} dairy cattle. The large feral population of northern Australia became established in the late 19th century, and smaller feral herds are in New Guinea, Tunisia, and northeastern Argentina.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to the direct effects inherent to stimulation of the HPA axis, some authors mention the consumption of alcohol and the increased intake of foods rich <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> sugars as indirect effects inherent to stress confrontation and relief and consequently to burnout (Kitaoka-Higashiguchi et al. 2009).|$|R
25|$|The Native Americans {{used two}} kinds of knife traps. One method was to encase a sharp blade <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> frozen upright on a block of ice. The wolf would cut itself while licking the blade and bleed to death. Some argue that this method is a myth. The other method was a baited torsion spring which when triggered, would stab the wolf in the head.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{subsistence}} foods, such as {{fish and}} marine mammals, {{and to a}} lesser extent shellfish, are the only significant direct dietary sources of two important types of the omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA protect against heart disease and possibly diabetes. The replacement of a subsistence diet that is low <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> high in omega-3s with a market-based Western diet has increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Alaska Natives. Many market (store-bought) foods are high in fats, carbohydrates, and sodium; and these may lead to increased weight gain, high cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), and chronic diseases.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of desert nomad tribes and is {{sometimes}} considered a meal {{in and of}} itself; a nomad can live on only camel milk for almost a month. Camel milk is rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and immunoglobulins; compared to cow's milk, it is lower <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> lactose, and higher in potassium, iron, and vitamin C. Bedouins believe the curative powers of camel milk are enhanced if the camel's diet consists of certain desert plants. Camel milk can readily {{be made into a}} drinkable yogurt, as well as butter or cheese, though the yields for cheese tend to be low.|$|E

25|$|Herring {{are found}} in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to 200 meters. Important herring {{fisheries}} have existed in these areas for centuries. Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations, each of which have their own migration routes. When spawning, a female produces from 20,000 to 50,000 eggs. After spawning, the herrings are depleted <b>in</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>and</b> migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton. Around Iceland, three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished. These stocks collapsed in the late 1960s, although two have since recovered. After the collapse, Iceland turned to capelin, which now account for about half of Iceland's total catch.|$|E
25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.|$|E
25|$|Whole {{foie gras}} is readily {{available}} from gourmet retailers in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Argentina and regions with a sizeable market for the product. In US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> especially suited for low-temperature preparation, because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation, because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared. Grade C livers are generally reserved for making sauces {{as well as other}} preparations where a higher proportion of blood-filled veins will not impair the appearance of the dish.|$|E
50|$|Because cannabinoids are soluble <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> alcohols, {{cannabis}} must {{be cooked}} {{with one of}} these two substances in order to infuse the cannabinoids into the food and activate their psychoactive effects. During preparation, the cannabis or its extract must be heated sufficiently to cause decarboxylation of its most abundant cannabinoid, THCA, converting it into the psychoactive THC.|$|R
50|$|Hall also invented {{new uses}} of {{antioxidants}} to prevent food spoilage, especially {{the onset of}} rancidity <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. Aware that unprocessed vegetable oils frequently contained natural antioxidants such as lecithin that slowed their spoilage, he developed means of combining these compounds with salts and other materials {{so that they could}} be readily introduced to other foods.|$|R
