It has a sign now and calls itself the [...] "Mitford Arms" [...] and a [...] "Temperance Hotel," [...] and we were told that you could get tea and bread and butter there but nothing else.

This was the outer ring of the temple where, in ancient days, the priests and captains had their home. Travelling across it for perhaps a hundred and fifty yards, they came near the second wall, which was like the first, only not quite so solid, and saw that on a stretch of beaten ground, and seated in the shadow, for the day was hot, the people of Bambatse were gathered to greet them.|$|E

50|$|By about 1600, Rotherhithe and Ratcliff parishes were country retreats of {{the wealthy}} Londoners, but gradually, as London grew, they <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>buildings</b> and population. By the late 1620s, those parishes {{accounted}} for 120 mariners.Wine was the primary trade product of commercial London and made the fortune of Rotherhithe’s mariners. Jones’ wealthiest associate was also a ship’s master, Anthony Wood of the ship Rainbow, who ranked {{at the top of}} parish taxpayers, owning shares of three ships and numerous houses {{on both sides of the}} Thames. He owed his wealth to the fine vintages of the Spanish port of Alicante, which was the favorite drink of James I and was a quite lucrative trade. Jones’ wealthiest client was William Speight, one of the mercantile elite, who resided in Vinery Ward, the wine merchant’s district, opposite Shakespeare’s Globe Theater. As warden of the Company of Merchant Taylors, Speight owned property that ranged from country estates in Suffolk to lower-level dwellings and warehouses in London. In May 1620, on his last trip before carrying the Pilgrims, Jones carried fifty tons of wine for Speight which was extremely profitable for the merchant.|$|E
50|$|Seitz {{started the}} {{operation}} {{by moving the}} 2nd Battalion of CT 26 to the railroad embankment of the Aachen-Cologne line tracks to prepare the battalion for a strike {{toward the center of}} Aachen from the east, rather than the more obvious directions of south or west, on October 13. He also sent the 3rd Battalion of CT 26 to attack from southeast to northwest into the city's factory district along a front of about 2,000 yd <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>buildings.</b> He instructed the 3rd Battalion to maintain contact with the 2nd Battalion. The 2nd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Derrill M. Daniel advanced on the left {{toward the center of the}} city and the 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel John Corley advanced on the right with the objective of clearing the factory area and moving to the hills on the northern side of the city, which were used as a public park named Lousberg. Each company was given a definite sector of the city to secure and was instructed to report their progress and position as they cleared each block. The 3rd Battalion slowly pushed forward so that on October 13, the 2nd Battalion could begin the main assault through the city with a secure flank. Seitz also took a company of the 1st Battalion from the reserve to clear an area along the tracks and protect the southern flank of the assaulting battalions. Seitz deployed a composite company from Regimental Headquarters, the headquarters company and the anti-tank company to hold the rest of the southern section of the line.|$|E
