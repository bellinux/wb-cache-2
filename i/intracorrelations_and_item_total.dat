It comprised of 40 items with six hypothetical groups. The face validity of the questionnaire was established through discussion with 141 final year medical students whereas content validity was established through discussion with experts from field of Medical Education and Psychiatry.

Methods A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted within the databases of PubMed, PsychINFO and Addiction Abstracts. A total of 12 publications reporting measures of reliability or validity were identified: 8 concerning SDS, 2 concerning CUDIT and one concerning CAST and PUM. Studies spanned adult and adolescent samples from general and specific user populations in a number of countries worldwide. Results All screening scales tended to have moderate to high internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from. 72 to. 92). Test-retest reliability <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> correlation have been reported for SDS with acceptable results. Results of validation studies varied depending on study population and standards used for validity assessment, but generally sensitivity, specificity and predictive power are satisfactory. Standard diagnostic cut-off points that can be generalized to different populations do not exist for any scale. Conclusion Short screening scales to assess dependence and other problems related to the use of cannabis seem to be a time and cost saving opportunity to estimate overall prevalences of cannabis-related negative consequences and to identify at-risk persons prior to using more extensive diagnostic instruments. Nevertheless, further research is needed to assess the performance of the tests in different populations and in comparison to broader criteria of cannabis-related problems other than dependence. </p...|$|R

Extended Abstracts Introduction There are different personal needs that shape people’s behavior. Personal needs of individuals working in organizations is an important issue that affects the individual’s willingness to do the job in terms of the needs being met in the process of doing their jobs. If individuals think that the job they do will meet their needs they want to do that job. It can be said that there is not only one criteria in choosing of profession but many criteria such as income benefits that the profession will provide to the individual, career opportunities and job security. The desire to have a career may occur as an effective motivation form due to self-respect beyond and outside of the material interests of individuals who have the desire to rise in the organization. As in all other occupations, in managerial profession one of the conditions to succeed is willingness. In addition, those who are willing to be managers are expected to apply for management positions. One of the most important pre-conditions in rising to the school management profession is teacher’s willingness to be a school administrator and finding himself/ herself appropriate in this profession. In this study, it has been aimed to develop a scale to determine the factors that affect teachers’ willingness to be school administrators by proceeding on career ladder and to find themselves appropriate for the profession. Methodology In the phase of scale development, “Approach of Creating Theoretical Form – Experimental From” and approach of consulting an expert opinion has been used together. First, the characteristics which affect being a school administrator have been studied in detail examining relevant literature and research results. A raw 92 - item questionnaire was created. Evaluation of the scale in terms of scope validity and usability has been done in accordance with the opinions of four experts in the field of educational administration and supervision, one expert in the field of psychological counseling and guidance, and one expert in the field of elementary classroom teaching. A form with 56 questions has been created by eliminating the items which are not required to be kept within the scope of the research according to expert opinions. The 56 items obtained have been re-examined in two trainings within the scope of the opinions of experts in the field of measurement and evaluation. 22 more items that measure similar statements have been removed. Remaining statements have been organized in five-point Likert type in accordance with the recommendations of the experts <b>and</b> 34 <b>items</b> have been included in the application studies. The data required for scale development study have been obtained from 221 teachers who work in primary and secondary schools (elementary) in central districts of Ankara city, in 2012 - 2013 academic year. To reveal the construct validity, exploratory factor analysis has been performed by using SPSS 11. 5 package software. In the exploratory factor analysis conducted in three stages it has been decided that the structures with how many factors are descriptive for the determined scale by conducting primarily the essential components analysis. In the second stage the factors consist of which variables have been determined with the varimax rotation. In the third stage obtained factors have been evaluated and named according to their load. Findings At the end of the factor analysis, five items which were overlapping <b>and</b> an <b>item</b> which was below. 40 level of acceptance have been removed. It has been determined that the scale consisted of four factors. In the first factor consists of 12 items, factor load values of items range from. 74 to. 57 <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> correlations range from. 72 to. 47. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient was calculated as. 90. Analyzing the item content in the factor, it has been seen that this factor can be grouped under the heading of “working conditions” which affect the teachers’ willingness on being school administrators. Second factor consists of 6 items. Factor load values of items range from. 89 to. 52 <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> correlations range from. 86 to. 48. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient was calculated as. 93. Analyzing the item content in the factor, it has been seen that this factor can be grouped under the heading of “balancing the private life” which affect the teachers’ willingness on being school administrators. In the third factor that consists of 6 items, factor load values of items range from. 82 to. 57 <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> correlations range from. 76 to. 51. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient was calculated as. 85. Analyzing the item content in the factor, it has been seen that this factor can be grouped under the heading of “professional competence and belief of success” which affect the teachers’ willingness on being school administrators. In the last factor that consists of 4 items, factor load values of items range from. 79 to. 68 <b>and</b> <b>item</b> <b>total</b> correlations range from. 69 to. 39. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient was calculated as. 77. Analyzing the item content in the factor, it has been seen that this factor can be grouped under the heading of “status and gain” which affect the teachers’ willingness on being school administrators. After varimax rotation the variances that explained by these four factors in the scale were calculated as respectively in the first dimension 20. 691 %, in the second dimension 17. 628 %, in the third dimension 13. 177 % and in the fourth dimension 8. 580 %. Four factors explained the 60. 075 % of the total variance. Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient for the entire scale was calculated as. 91. Discussion At the end of this study which aims to develop a scale to determine the willingness and the level of adjustment of the teachers relating to become school administrators, it has been revealed that the structure validity of the scale which consists of four factor <b>and</b> 28 <b>items</b> was ensured. Analyzing the Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficients, it has been determined that the developed scale can be used as a valid and reliable tool on determining the willingness and level of adjustment of the teachers relating to become school administrators. It can be said that the scale can be used in giving an opinion on teachers’ perspectives relating to school leadership profession as well as determining their individual willingness on becoming school administrators and level of compliance. On the other hand, conducting researches of replicated validity and reliability studies and using the scale on teachers who work in different educational levels and different schools will make an important contribution on the validity and the reliability of the scale.  </p...|$|R
