While Kanaʻina had made out a will, he had left {{everything}} to his son, and so had died <b>intestate.</b> Petitions to administer the estate began the following day. Probate proceedings were litigated for four years, between 1877 and 1881, and re-affirmed in 1886.|$|E

5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died <b>intestate.</b> His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{law is the}} law {{governing}} a person's family matters. In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib (2009), the High Court {{identified a}} number of personal laws, including the <b>Intestate</b> Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims; and regulations 103(2) and (3) of the Prisons Regulations, which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government, and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Member <b>intestate</b> in 1820, the estate was {{inherited}} by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748–1820), who died shortly after inheriting the estate. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop the estate by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling debts, and although the estate had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms {{and other parts of the}} estate to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the estate was mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained of the estate was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.|$|E

60|$|As some {{sanction}} {{of religion is}} mixed with almost every concern of civil life, and as the ecclesiastical court took cognizance of all religious matters, it drew to itself not only all questions relative to tithes and advowsons, but whatever related to marriages, wills, the estate of <b>intestates,</b> the breaches of oaths and contracts,--in a word, everything which did not touch life or feudal property.|$|R
5|$|Wilder-Neligan's initial {{role was}} as a deputy {{district}} officer for the garrison of Rabaul {{on the island of}} Neupommern (later renamed New Britain). In May 1921, when the military administration of the former German colony was handed over to an Australian civil one mandated by the League of Nations, he was transferred to the administration of the newly created Territory of New Guinea as district officer for Talasea in west New Britain. Early in January 1923, the Administrator, Evan Wisdom, summoned him to Rabaul to answer allegations of financial malpractice that had been made against him by a former German planter. It appears that he resigned and sailed for Rabaul. Going ashore to rest for a few days at the village of Ekerapi before continuing his journey, he died during the night of 9/10 January. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died <b>intestate</b> and with debts.|$|E
5|$|His wife Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi was a {{widow and}} niece of Kamehameha I. She was also married to Kamehameha II before he {{converted}} to Christianity {{and gave up}} all but one wife. Kanaʻina and Kekāuluohi lived in a traditional aliʻi style home in a sacred neighborhood in Honolulu called Pohukaina near Kekūanāoʻa, Kaʻahumanu and their offspring. The compound would eventually become the Iolani Palace (the official Royal Residence of the Hawaiian Royal Family) and Palace Walk when Kekūanāoʻa built Hale Aliʻi {{in the center of}} the families estates as a gift to his daughter Victoria Kamāmalu. Kanaʻina kept his property at the palace until his death and would be the only original owner to do so while the Palace was in use, living there through five monarchs, from the 1820s to 1877. Kanaʻina's son, William Charles Lunalilo, was named by Kamehameha III as an heir to the throne of the kingdom and ascended in 1873 while his father still lived. Lunalilo died only a year later, three years before his father's death on March 13, 1877. Having not re-written his will, which left everything to his son who had predeceased, Kanaʻina died <b>intestate.</b> Probate hearings proceeded for 5 years. On final adjudication his property was auctioned with the proceeds going to several of Kanaʻina's cousins including Ruth Keelikōlani and Bernice Pauahi Bishop.|$|E
5|$|Somerset House {{was built}} by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, regent of England from 1547 to 1549, {{demolishing}} three inns and {{the church of the}} Nativity of Our Lady and the Innocents in the process. After Somerset was executed in 1552, it became an occasional residence for Princess Elizabeth. When she became Queen in 1558, she returned part of the house to Seymour's family (with ownership passing to his son, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford); the remainder was an occasional meeting place for the Royal Society. After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I. The building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark. After James died in 1625, his body lay there <b>intestate</b> for a month. The building was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House. It had an irregular series of owners and residents for much of the 18th century until it was demolished in 1775. The house was rebuilt as a series of government buildings. The Stamp Office, later to become the Inland Revenue was established in Somerset House in 1789. In the late 20th century, a number of art galleries were set up on vacant parts, including the Courtauld Institute of Art and the King's College London School of Law.|$|E

50|$|The widow {{can gain}} no {{advantage}} from any advancement.

The usual judicial view was that any considerable sum of money paid to a child at that child's request is an advancement; thus payment of a son's debts of honour has been held to be an advancement. On the other hand, trivial gifts and presents to a child are undoubtedly not advancements.|$|R

The former two territories had as heirs the comital families of Schwarzburg and Stolberg by legation, but were fiefs of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, whose Prince-Bishop Henry Julius, from the Guelphic ducal family of Brunswick and Lunenburg-Wolfenbüttel withheld them with violence from the <b>intestated</b> heirs.|$|R

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has {{installed}} guardrail systems on interstate highways and other highways {{in accordance with}} a variety of standards throughout the years. Traffic volume has increased and the posted speeds have been raised on most INDOT’s interstate highways. Consequently, the characteristics of run-off-the-road (ROR) crashes may have changed. In the meantime, material prices have increased considerably and the guardrail maintenance and crash repair costs have increased accordingly. There is no doubt all these changes will not only greatly affect the ROR crash prediction, but also greatly affect the guardrail benefit/cost analysis. This study examined the current use of roadside guardrails on INDOT <b>intestates,</b> State highways, and US highways, roadways, including types and lengths of guardrails, types and numbers of guardrail end treatments, and field guardrail positions. Based on the records of total 4657 ROR crashes occurred in 2004 and 2006, this study investigated the characteristics of ROR crashes, such as frequencies and locations of ROR crashes, crash consequences (number of vehicles involved, injuries and fatalities), and the effects of main factors, in particular roadway geometrics, seasons and traffic volume, on the highways of different classes. Furthermore, this study investigated the features of vehicle-guardrail crashes, including impact positions and corresponding frequencies and consequences. ROR crash predictions were examined in all aspects in this study, including encroachment rates, crash probabilities, and severity probabilities. It was found that the encroachment rates obtained by this study are less than those in the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide. This study evaluated the issues associated with the guardrail crash repair costs, such as parts costs, labor costs, and equipment costs. Guardrail steel parts prices increased dramatically. For guardrail terminal crash repairs, the majority of the repair costs were spent on parts. Hex-Foam Sandwich demonstrated the greatest repair cost per crash and ET 2000 Plus demonstrated the lowest repair cost per crash. The repair costs are overestimated for CAT, ET 2000 Plus, SKT 350 and Impact Barrel, but underestimated for other crash cushions in the INDOT Design Manual. Different from the guardrail terminal repairs, the labor rather than the parts consumed the majority of the repair costs for regular guardrail repairs. The average guardrail repair cost is $ 722 per crash that is less than the guardrail repair cost the INDOT Design Manual. The annual average guardrail maintenance cost is $ 0. 305 per linear foot. ArcMap was utilized to develop an interface for effectively managing and analyzing guardrails and ROR crash data...|$|R
