After OCRL 1 MLPA probe sets validation in 7 OCRL 1 deleted patients, we screened 5 female patients to asses their carrier status and 15 patients with suspected OCRL, previously diagnosed as sequence-negative.

Neither mosaic deletion nor duplication was found in the 15 patients suspected of having Lowe syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Our MLPA allows rapid and precise OCRL 1 gene quantification.

40|$|Background: Pentraxins are {{a family}} of plasma {{proteins}} characterized by their pentameric assembly and calcium-dependent ligand binding. The recent determination of the crystal structure for {{a member of this}} family, human serum amyloid P component (SAP), provides a basis for the comparative analysis of the pentraxin family. Results: We have compared the sequences, tertiary structures and quaternary arrangements of SAP with human C-reactive protein (CRP), Syrian hamster SAP (HSAP) and Limulus polyphemus CRP (LIM). These proteins can adopt a 3 -jelly roll topology and a hydrophobic core similar to that seen in SAP. Only minor differences are observed in the positions of residues involved in coordinating calcium ions. Conclusions: Calcium-mediated ligand binding by CRP, HSAP and LIM is similar to that defined by the crystal structure of SAP, but sequence differences in the hydrophobic pocket explain the differential ligand specificities exhibited by the homologous proteins.

Using high-density SNP array, we have undertaken a comprehensive investigation of chromosome 18 for CNV discovery and characterisation of distribution and association with chromosome architecture. We identified 399 CNVs, of which loss represents 98 %, 58 % are less than 2. 5 kb in size and 71 % are intergenic.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{southern}} Africa, oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is {{the most}} common autosomal recessive disease amongst black Africans, occurring with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 3 900 individuals. OCA occurs in southern African Caucasoids with a frequency that reflects the European origins of this population, approximately 1 in 20 - 30 000. OCA type 1 is caused by mutations in the tyrosinase gene on chromosome 11 q. Tyrosinase mutations occur in the Caucasoid population but are extremely rare in black Africans. OCA type 2 is caused by mutations in the P gene on chromosome 15 q. P gene mutations occur in both the black and Caucasoid populations. A sub-type of OCA 2 seen in black individuals, brown OCA (BOCA), is also caused by mutations at the P gene locus.

We have studied {{the efficiency of the}} TALEN system in rice as well as the nature and inheritability of TALEN-induced mutations and found important features of this technology. The N 287 C 230 TALEN backbone resulted in low mutation rates (0 – 6. 6 %), but truncations in its C-terminal domain dramatically increased efficiency to 25 %. In most transgenic T 0 plants, TALEN produced a single prevalent mutation accompanied by a variety of low-frequency mutations. For each independent T 0 plant, the prevalent mutation was present in most tissues within a single tiller as well as in all tillers examined, suggesting that TALEN-induced mutations occurred very early {{in the development of the}} shoot apical meristem. Multigenerational analysis showed that TALEN-induced mutations were stably transmitted to the T 1 and T 2 populations in a normal Mendelian fashion. In our study, the vast majority of TALEN-induced mutations (~ 81 %) affected multiple bases and ~ 70 % of them were deletions.

40|$|Thalassemia {{is among}} the most common genetic {{diseases}} worldwide. α-Thalassemia is usually caused by deletion of {{one or more of the}} duplicated HBA genes on chromosome 16. In contrast, most β-thalassemia results from point mutations that decrease or eliminate expression of the HBB gene on chromosome 11. Deletions within the HBB locus result in thalassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal Hb. Although routine diagnostic testing cannot distinguish thalassemia deletions from point mutations, deletional hereditary persistence of fetal Hb is notable for having an elevated HbF level with a normal mean corpuscular volume. A small number of <b>deletions</b> <b>accounts</b> for most α-thalassemias; in contrast, there are no predominant HBB deletions causing β-thalassemia. To facilitate the identification and characterization of deletions of the HBA and HBB globin loci, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization using a custom oligonucleotide microarray. We accurately mapped the breakpoints of known and previously uncharacterized HBB deletions defining previously uncharacterized deletion breakpoints by PCR amplification and sequencing. The array also successfully identified the common HBA deletions - SEA and - FIL. In summary, comparative genomic hybridization can be used to characterize deletions of the HBA and HBB loci, allowing high-resolution characterization of novel deletions that are not readily detected by PCR-based methods.

We studied 20 children, from 17 independent families, fulfilling the clinical and the ultrasonographic criteria of NPHP. Analysis for a homozygous deletion of the NPHP 1 gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction on the genomic DNA of all patients. Patients were best categorized as 75 % juvenile NPHP, 5 % infantile NPHP, and 20 % Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRD).

We previously analyzed multiplex PCR products by gel electrophoresis and quantitation of fluorescently labeled primers with the Gene Scanner {{in order to test}} carrier status. These multiplex PCR protocols detect DMD gene deletions adequately, but require up to 18 pairs of fluorochrome-labeled primers.

Localization of the gene corresponding to mPNR to mouse Chr 9 near the rd 7 locus made it a candidate for the site of the rd 7 mutation.

The deletions were identified by MLPA analysis and characterized by custom CGH-array and quantitative PCR to define their boundaries. The deletions, ranging from 2. 9 to 180 kb, removed one or more loci contiguous to the STK 11 gene in six patients, while partial STK 11 gene deletions were present in the remaining nine cases. By means of DNA sequencing, we were able to precisely characterize the breakpoints in each case. Of the 30 breakpoints, 16 were located in Alu elements, revealing non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) as the putative mechanism for the deletions of the STK 11 gene, which lays in a region with high Alu density. In the remaining cases, other mechanisms could be hypothesized, such as microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).

2500|$|ALGS is an {{autosomal}} dominant multi-system disorder affecting several body systems including the liver, heart, skeleton, eye, facial structure, kidneys and vascular system. The most clinically significant concerns stem from liver, heart, vascular or renal problems. Mutations in JAG1 were first discovered {{to be responsible}} for ALGS by researchers at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the National Institutes of Health in 1997. Patients who are clinically consistent with the disorder usually have a mutation in JAG1 (94%), while a smaller 2% have a mutation in NOTCH2. Over half of individuals with mutations in the gene did not inherit it from either parent, and thus have a de novo mutation. JAG1 mutation types include protein truncating (splice site, frameshift, and nonsense), missense, and whole gene <b>deletions</b> <b>accounting</b> for 80%, 7%, and 12% respectively. Since all mutation types lead to a patient phenotype, it is thought that haploinsufficiency for JAG1 is the likely disease mechanism of action. [...] Although individuals can have a range of mutation types in JAG1, all of the known mutations lead to loss of the function of one copy, and, there is no correlation between mutation type or location and disease severity. Though individuals with ALGS have several body systems affected, there is a subset of individuals with JAG1 mutations who present with tetralogy of fallot/pulmonary stenosis that do not show the other clinical signs of the syndrome.

Background & Aims; Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} (PJS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome {{characterized by}} mucocutanoeus pigmentation, multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract {{and an increased}} risk of cancer at a young age. Inactivating germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene STK 11 /LKB 1 have been detected in approximately 80 % of patients. The aim of this work is to clarify the molecular basis of the disease in Italian PJS patients. Methods: We investigate the STK 11 /LKB 1 gene mutations in a well-characterized series of 9 unrelated Italian PJS patients, by using a combination of PCR, RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, Southern blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. Results: We have characterized the specific STK 11 mutation in 6 probands, and identified 2 truncating mutations (1 novel and 1 known mutation), one missense known mutation in the exon four, and two novel small in-frame deletions in the exon six. Finally, we have found an intra-exonic in-frame deletion encompassing exons 2 and 4 : the possible mechanism leading to this genomic rearrangement is most likely an Alu-Alu homologous recombination. Conclusions: In our study point mutations, small scale deletions/insertions and exonic STK 11 <b>deletions</b> <b>account</b> for about 67 % of PJS; mutations in other STK 11 related genes examined have not be found. Other gene inactivating methods, such as chromosomal rearrangements mediated by Alu-Alu homologous recombination, which cannot be detected by routinely molecular biology screening methods, might be responsible for PJS in mutations negative population subset. However, the existence of genetic heterogeneity cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{external}} ophthalmoplegia (PEO), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and Pearson syndrome are {{the three}} sporadic clinical syndromes classically associated with single large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). PEO plus is a term frequently utilized in the clinical setting to identify patients with PEO and some degree of multisystem involvement, but a precise definition is not available. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to better define the clinical phenotypes associated with a single mtDNA deletion, by a retrospective study on a large cohort of 228 patients from the database of the "Nation-wide Italian Collaborative Network of Mitochondrial Diseases". In our database, single <b>deletions</b> <b>account</b> for about a third of all patients with mtDNA-related disease, more than previously recognized. We elaborated new criteria for the definition of PEO and "KSS spectrum" (a category of which classic KSS represents the most severe extreme). The criteria for "KSS spectrum" include the resulting multisystem clinical features associated with the KSS features, and which therefore can predict their presence or subsequent development. With the new criteria, we were able to classify nearly all our single-deletion patients: 64. 5  % PEO, 31. 6  % KSS spectrum (including classic KSS 6. 6  %) and 2. 6  % Pearson syndrome. The deletion length was greater in KSS spectrum than in PEO, whereas heteroplasmy was inversely related with age at onset. We believe that the new phenotype definitions implemented here may contribute to a more homogeneous patient categorization, which will be useful in future cohort studies of natural history and clinical trials...|$|R
5000|$|ALGS is an {{autosomal}} dominant multi-system disorder affecting several body systems including the liver, heart, skeleton, eye, facial structure, kidneys and vascular system. The most clinically significant concerns stem from liver, heart, vascular or renal problems. Mutations in JAG1 were first discovered {{to be responsible}} for ALGS by researchers at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the National Institutes of Health in 1997. Patients who are clinically consistent with the disorder usually have a mutation in JAG1 (94%), while a smaller 2% have a mutation in NOTCH2. Over half of individuals with mutations in the gene did not inherit it from either parent, and thus have a de novo mutation. JAG1 mutation types include protein truncating (splice site, frameshift, and nonsense), missense, and whole gene <b>deletions</b> <b>accounting</b> for 80%, 7%, and 12% respectively. Since all mutation types lead to a patient phenotype, it is thought that haploinsufficiency for JAG1 is the likely disease mechanism of action. [...] Although individuals can have a range of mutation types in JAG1, all of the known mutations lead to loss of the function of one copy, and, there is no correlation between mutation type or location and disease severity. Though individuals with ALGS have several body systems affected, there is a subset of individuals with JAG1 mutations who present with tetralogy of fallot/pulmonary stenosis that do not show the other clinical signs of the syndrome. Given the variable expressivity of the disease, there may be other genetic or environmental modifiers present beyond the original JAG1 mutation.|$|R
40|$|Background:Hereditary non-polyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant disease due to germline mutations of human mismatch repair genes, mainly hMLH 1 and hMSH 2. The {{aim of the}} present study was to identify the point mutations and large genomic deletions of hMLH 1 and hMSH 2 genes in 14 Chinese HNPCC families. Methods: Fourteen families fulfilling the Chinese HNPCC criteria were involved in this study. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples was analyzed. Point mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by DNA sequencing. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction and GeneScan analysis were employed to detect the large genomic deletions of these two genes. Results: Four of the 14 probands (29 %) had sequence abnormalities that probably affect the protein function in the exonic regions of hMLH 1 and hMSH 2 genes. Included were one complete deletion of exons 1 – 7 and one missense mutation of the hMSH 2 gene, and one nonsense mutation and one missense mutation of the hMLH 1 gene. The large genomic <b>deletion</b> <b>accounted</b> for 25 % (one out of four) of all mutations. Half (two out of four, 50 %) of the mutations were missense mutation. In addition, one silent mutation, four polymorphisms in the exonic regions and four polymorphisms in the intronic regions were also discovered. Conclusions: Point mutations and large genomic deletions of the hMLH 1 and hMSH 2 genes were responsible for nearly one-third of Chinese HNPCC families. Detection of large genomic deletions should be involved in the routine screening manual for HNPCC families. Key words: hereditary non-polyposis {{colorectal cancer}} (HNPCC) – hMLH 1 gene – hMSH 2 gene point mutation – large genomic deletion...|$|R
