Much of the current research has focused on photorefractive materials (SBN and LiNbO 3) and polymers, despite various problems with expense, durability, response time and retention periods. Photon echo techniques, though promising, are questionable due to the need for cryogenic conditions. Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) films are an attractive alternative recording medium. Great strides have been made in refining BR, and materials with storage lifetimes as long as 100 days have recently become available. The ability to deposit this robust polycrystalline material as high quality optical films suggests the use of BR as a recording medium for commercial optical disks. Our own recent research has demonstrated the suitability of BR films for real time spatial filtering and holography.

The holographic gratings were fabricated successfully in these photopolymer samples by conventional opti-cal interference method. We investigated the effect of dendrimer, either as a binder or as a plasticizer in the cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), on the diffraction behavior.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on the {{application}} of 3 -D photorefractive crystals disks for <b>holographic</b> optical <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> and optical neural networks. Chapter 1 gives some introductory background and motivation for the materials given in this thesis. In Chapter 2, the coupled-mode analysis and Born's approximation in anisotropic crystals is reviewed. The results are {{similar to that of}} isotropic materials. However, there are approximations that are often neglected in the literature. Chapter 3 starts with the description of the holographic 3 -D disk for <b>data</b> <b>storage,</b> and analyzes the various alignment errors and tolerance problems for a 3 D disk system. Of particular interest is the effects in image reconstruction caused by rotational angle error. An optimum configuration is found that minimizes this error. Chapter 4 examines the <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> density of 3 -D disks and volume holographic storage systems that utilize wavelength/angle and spatial multiplexing. The maximum storage density and the geometry that achieves this density is derived. Chapter 5 discusses the diffraction efficiency of 3 -D disks fabricated with photorefractive crystals. Practical geometries and crystal orientations for achieving maximum uniform diffraction efficiency are given and compared to the maximum obtainable diffraction efficiencies using arbitrary cut crystals. Experimental results are shown. Also derived in this chapter are the double grating effect from crystal anisotropy, and the optimum configuration for getting maximum diffraction efficiency using the 90 degree recording geometry. The Kuhktarev band-transport model of the photorefractive effect is examined briefly with emphas{{is on the}} anisotropy of the material.

40|$|Solid state visible lasers have various {{applications}} {{in the field of}} color display, <b>holographic</b> techniques, <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> and medical treatment. So far green laser output has been obtained using methods of frequency conversion, thus increasing the cost of building the laser as well due to the low efficiency of such techniques. There are very few materials which produce visible laser radiation directly. Trivalent Praseodymium (Pr 3 +) is one such example. It is quite interesting because of its unique energy scheme which offers multiple transitions in the visible spectrum. We are mainly interested in the energy transition from 3 P 0 to 3 H 5 which produces light in the green visible spectrum (523 nm). Green lasers are particularly useful and important in certain types of underwater communications. Sea water has low absorbance and offers relatively low scattering for green light, thus making green light {{one of the most effective}} sources for underwater communications. Excited State Absorption (ESA) is a phenomenon where absorption occurs from an occupied excited state level of the specie. This can lead to additional loss, which causes complications for lasing in the form of increased threshold power, reduced power slope efficiency, and change in lasing wavelength due to offset in the highest emission cross-section. This thesis examines the spectroscopic profile of Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (Pr:YLF) including the ground state absorption, fluorescence, and ESA in great detail.

We establish the use of ink as a recording medium in different colors and absorption ranges to rapidly produce optical nanostructures in 1 D geometries. The gratings produced with four different types of ink had the same periodicity (840 nm); however, they produce distant wavelength dependent diffraction responses to monochromatic and broadband light. The nanostructures of gratings consisting of blue and red inks displayed high diffraction efficiency of certain wavelengths while the black and brown ink based gratings diffracted broadband light. These gratings have high potential to be used as low-cost photonic structures in wavelength-dependent optical filters.
