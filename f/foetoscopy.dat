5000|$|The legal {{debate on}} fetal rights {{sometimes}} invokes {{the notion of}} fetal viability. Its primary determinant is fetal lung capacity which typically develops at twenty-three to twenty-four weeks. The twenty-three weeks is usually regarded as the lower bound of fetal viability because technology {{has been unable to}} surpass the limit set by lung development. It was nonetheless stated that technology has made it possible to regard the fetus as a patient independent of the mother. In Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. G., the judges argued that [...] "technologies like real-time ultrasound, foetal heart monitors and <b>foetoscopy</b> can clearly show us that the foetus is alive" [...] and thus the born alive rule is [...] "outdated and indefensible".|$|E
40|$|Twin to twin {{transfusion}} syndrome (TTTS) affects 10 to 15 % of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Untreated, perinatal loss exceeds 80 %, {{of which}} survivors {{have a great}} risk for long-term neurological disorders as psychomotor retardation or cerebral palsy. TTTS can be treated using <b>foetoscopy</b> and selective ablation of the twin-to-twin blood vessels under local or regional anaesthesia. However, local or regional anaesthesia does not always result in excellent maternal comfort, nor does it provide foetal immobilisation, necessary for optimal surgical conditions. Using a continuous infusion rate of remifentanil 0. 1 microg/kg/min, perfect foetal immobilisation and excellent maternal sedation was achieved. Only mild respiratory acidosis was observed {{as a result of}} mild respiratory depression. In no mother apnoe occurred. All haemodynamic parameters, both foetal and maternal, remained stable during the procedure. Maternal sedation, respiratory depression and foetal immobilisation were quickly reversible following cessation of the remifentanil infusion. status: publishe...|$|E

In 1994 the the Parliament enacted the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act. To take care of certain inadequacies and practical difficulties {{in the administration of}} the Act amendments {{have been made in the}} content and the title of the act as well as the rules in 2003. This compilation puts together a comprehensive set of guidelines elaborating various provisions of the Act and the Rules and their implementation mechanism which clarifies various issues on which the medical practitioners implementing agencies and people at large have varying interpretations to bring in convergence of opinion among all the stake holders. sex determination techinques, sex pre-selection techniques, PC&PNDT, ultrasonography, genetic clinic, sex selective abortion, gender ration, <b>foetoscopy,</b> amniotic fluid, genetic counselling, regulation and monitoring of act, Medical Practice, Health Studies, women's health, reproductive rights, reproductive health...|$|E
40|$|The {{prenatal}} {{evaluation of}} the postnatal prognosis of fetuses displaying congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has improved {{over the past five}} years. Although the accuracy of these outcome predictions remains a matter of debate, it seems important that all teams in charge of those fetuses use the same prognostic factors {{in order to be able}} to improve and compare their practice. Prediction will be based on Lung over Head Ratio (LHR) between 22 and 28 weeks or the LHR observed/expected whatever the gestational age, (the measurement of which relies on very strict criteria), the position of the liver and lung volumes measured by MRI. These factors allow the identification of a group of fetuses likely to have a poor outcome. In the group with LHR less than 1 or LHR o/e less than 25 % and where the liver is in the thorax, survival is less than 20 %. In utero treatment could be offered to these fetuses. A balloon can be placed in the trachea, under the vocal cords, by <b>foetoscopy</b> between 28 and 30 weeks of pregnancy. The balloon is retrieved at 34 weeks. The preliminary results show that survival in this group increases from 20 % to up to 50 %. The morbidity does not seem to be increased but is currently under evaluation. Â© 2011 SPLF.
