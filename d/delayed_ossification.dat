40|$|Background: <b>Delayed</b> fetal {{skeletal}} <b>ossification</b> {{is one of}} {{the known}} complications of maternal diabetes. Objective: The present study was designed to evaluate the protective role of petroleum ether extract of Cissus quadrangularis (PECQ) on diabetes-induced <b>delayed</b> fetal skeletal <b>ossification.</b> Materials and Methods : Female Wistar rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg, intraperitonial) before mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, the pregnant rats were divided into three groups: normal control group, diabetic control group, and diabetic + CQ group. The diabetic + CQ group pregnant rats were treated with PECQ (500 mg/kg body weight) throughout their gestation period. Immediately after delivery, pups were collected from all three groups and processed for alizarin red S-alcian blue staining in order to examine the pattern of skeletal ossification. Results : Fewer ossification centers and decreased extent of ossification of forelimb and hindlimb bones were observed in the neonatal pups of diabetic control group as compared to those in the normal control group. PECQ pretreatment significantly restored the ossification centers and improved the extent of ossification of forelimb and hindlimb bones in the neonatal pups of diabetic + CQ group as compared to those in the diabetic control group. Conclusions : The results suggested that PECQ treatment is effective against diabetes-induced <b>delayed</b> fetal skeletal <b>ossification.</b> However, further studies on the isolation and characterization of active constituents of PECQ, which can cross the placental barrier and are responsible for the bone anabolic activity are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Cleidocranial {{dysplasia}} (OMIM 119600) is a skeletal dysplasia {{caused by}} mutations in the bone/cartilage specific osteoblast transcription factor RUNX 2 gene.

A few patients {{have been reported}} with recurrent fractures or osteoporosis {{but these are not}} considered features of the disease. We report a patient with classical findings of cleidocranial dysplasia: markedly hypoplastic clavicles, <b>delayed</b> <b>ossification</b> of the pubic rami, multiple pseudoepiphyses of the metacarpals, and dental anomalies including delayed eruption of permanent dentition and multiple supernumerary teeth. The patient also had radiographic and biochemical features of hypophosphatasia (OMIM 241500, 146300) and was initially diagnosed with this condition. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity has been consistently reduced and specific enzyme substrates, phosphoethanolamine and pyridoxal- 5 '-phosphate, have been elevated. However, no mutations were found on direct sequencing of the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene using a protocol that detects up to 94 % of all mutations causing hypophosphatasia.

40|$|INTRODUCTION For ultrasonographic {{diagnosis}} of a fetal trisomy so-called "soft markers" (=ultrasonographically detectable morphological variants) are used. Detection of {{a certain number of}} them increases the diagnostic certainty of a fetal trisomy. Up to now there are very few diagnostically accepted osseous soft markers for trisomy. Hence potential osseous soft markers applicable for first and second trimester ultrasound screening for trisomy 21, 18 or 13 were studied. METHODS Postmortal fetal X-rays (ap, lateral) of 358 fetuses (trisomy 21 : n =  109, trisomy 18 : n =  46; trisomy 13 : n =  38, control group: n =  165). RESULTS Not yet described but with trisomy 21 statistically associated soft markers were un-timely os sternale <b>ossification,</b> <b>delayed</b> os sacrum <b>ossification,</b> shortened os maxillare, reduced os maxillare-jaw-corner distance, augmented orbita height, premature os calcaneus ossification, bell-shaped thorax, coronal clefts, trend to wider binocular as well as wider intraocular distances; for trisomy 18 : elevated clavicula slope, reduced number of ribs, bell-shaped thorax, coronal clefts, reduced os maxillare-jaw-corner distance, shortened ramus mandibulare, shortened os metacarpale IV and V, augmented ratio between biparietal diameter and (osseus and soft-tissue) shoulder width; for trisomy 13 : longer os nasale, elevated clavicula slope, premature sternum, <b>delayed</b> os sacrum <b>ossification,</b> delayed/premature cranium ossification, reduced number of ribs, coronal clefts, reduced os maxillare-jaw-corner distance, shortened ramus mandibulare, augmented orbita height, shortened os metacarpale V and a tendency for a shortened os metacarpale IV.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{influence}} of nutrition on skeletal health was studied. Obesity is a common disease in companion animal practice. In dogs and cats obesity often exacerbates osteoarthritis (OA). Although in humans we consider obesity as a serious health issue, in companion animals we proved that obesity or overweight is considered as normal, beautiful, or ideal. Dietary long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been proved {{to be effective in}} dogs suffering from OA by mediating the inflammatory response. We demonstrated that treatment of cats suffering from OA with dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA also resulted in improvement of locomotion. Vitamin D is important for skeletal health as it plays a central role in calcium metabolism. Sunlight has long been recognized as a major provider of vitamin D for humans. We demonstrated that the “sunshine vitamin” is synthesized in sufficient amount in the investigated carnivorous species, thus they are largely dependent on dietary intake of vitamin D. High calcium and/or vitamin D intake in puppies has proven to influence skeletal development at older age. Since quite some puppies start to be raised on PMRs, the calcium and vitamin D content of the PMRs were investigated and proved to be higher compared to the declaration on the package. Furthermore, most breeders overfeed their puppies with PMR, which resulted in calcium and vitamin D intakes exceeding the safe upper limit. Another common developmental orthopedic diseases in young dogs is medial coronoid disease (MCD). <b>Delayed</b> endochondral <b>ossification</b> plays a crucial role in MCD development. This <b>delayed</b> endochondral <b>ossification</b> might be due to a (relative) vitamin D deficiency. We demonstrated that supplementing the daily ration of young growing dogs susceptible to develop MCD with vitamin D did not result in a decreased prevalence of MCD. These findings are suggesting that other factors play a role in <b>delayed</b> endochondral <b>ossification</b> preceding MCD development. The conversion of vitamin D is stimulated by growth hormone (GH), which is mainly produced by the pituitary gland, In adult dogs with Cushings disease an important source of GH is suppressed. The removal of the pituitary gland as treatment results in the removal of an important source of GH, and in humans this results in osteoporosis. However, in adult dogs, 1, 25 DHCC and PTH plasma levels were not different before and after hypophysectomy compared to healthy control dogs. In conclusion, neither in dogs with Cushings disease nor after hypophysectomy, {{there is a need for}} vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin A is the other vitamin which plays a role in maintaining skeletal health. Vitamin A excess in cats has been studied in the 1960 s and 1970 s and demonstrated skeletal hyperostosis, mostly in the cervical spine. It is remarkable that moderate increased vitamin D supplementation (as present in natural feeding stuffs like raw liver) decreases the detrimental influence of excess vitamin A on liver fibrosis, but not on the skeleton, possibly due to the anti-fibrotic effect of moderate vitamin D...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne G protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) can activate {{more than}} one G protein, but the physiologic importance of such activation has not been demonstrated in vivo.

DSEL mutant mice exhibit abnormalities in embryonic endochondral bone development, including <b>delayed</b> <b>ossification</b> and increased chondrocyte proliferation. Analysis of the differentiation of embryonic metatarsals in vitro shows that PTH(1 – 34) and forskolin inhibit, whereas active phorbol ester stimulates, hypertrophic differentiation.

40|$|Hedgehog (Hh) {{signalling}} {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} osteoblasts and osteoclasts whose balanced activities are critical for proper bone formation. As many mouse mutants in the Hh pathway are embryonic lethal, questions on the exact effects of Hh signalling on osteogenesis remain. Using zebrafish, we show that there are two populations of endochondral osteoblasts with differential sensitivity to Hh signalling. One, formed outside the cartilage structure, requires low levels of Hh signalling and fails to differentiate in Indian hedgehog mutants. The other derives from chondrocytes and requires higher levels of Hh signalling to form. This latter population develops significantly earlier in mutants with increased Hh signalling, leading to premature endochondral ossification, and also fails to differentiate in Indian hedgehog mutants, resulting in severely <b>delayed</b> endochondral <b>ossification.</b> Additionally, we demonstrate that the timing of first osteoclast activity positively correlates to Hh levels in both endochondral and dermal bone. ...|$|R
30|$|Studies {{have shown}} that FGF 18 acts as a ligand for the FGFR 3 receptor, {{expressed}} on proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Liu et al.

Ellsworth et al. have shown a significant direct effect of FGF 18 on the growth and proteoglycan synthesis of mature murine and human chondrocytes [11]. An in-vivo study by Power et al.
