5|$|During production, Hergé kept {{abreast of}} the {{turbulent}} political developments <b>in</b> <b>Tibet.</b> In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin <b>in</b> <b>Tibet</b> was published in China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese Tibet. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} in the orientation of Cenozoic range growth <b>in</b> northeastern <b>Tibet</b> define two modes by which India-Asia convergence was accommodated. Thermochronological age-elevation transects from the hanging walls of two major thrust-fault systems reveal diachronous Miocene exhumation of the Laji-Jishi Shan <b>in</b> northeastern <b>Tibet.</b> Whereas accelerated growth of the WNW-trending eastern Laji Shan began ca. 22 Ma, rapid growth of the adjacent, north-trending Jishi Shan did not commence until ca. 13 Ma. This change in thrust-fault orientation refl ects a Middle Miocene change in the kinematic style of plateau growth, from long-standing NNE-SSW contraction that mimicked the plate convergence direction to the inclusion of new structures accommodating east-west motion. This kinematic shift <b>in</b> northeastern <b>Tibet</b> coincides with expansion of the plateau margin <b>in</b> southeastern <b>Tibet,</b> the onset of normal faulting <b>in</b> central <b>Tibet,</b> and accelerated shortening <b>in</b> northern <b>Tibet.</b> Together these phenomena suggest a plateau-wide reorganization of deformation...|$|R

The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition.
