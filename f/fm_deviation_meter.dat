40|$|The Microwave Reflectometer Ionization Sensor (MRIS) is an {{instrument}} being developed {{for use in}} detecting and ranging of electron density layers in the reentry plasma of a space transfer vehicle. The rationale for {{the selection of the}} Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC) system used in the feasibility study for the MRIS is presented. A 25 GHz single-oscillator system and a 220 GHz double-oscillator system are described. The 25 GHz system was constructed and tested in the laboratory and test results are presented. As developed, the system employs a sideband spacing of 160 MHz. Based on an estimated electromagnetic wave velocity in the plasma, a round-trip phase shift measurement accuracy of +/- 7. 6 degrees was required for the desired +/- 1 / 2 cm distance measurement accuracy. The interaction of parallel ground and reflecting planes produces interference that prevents the basic DSBSC system from meeting the accuracy goal so a frequency modulation was added to the system to allow averaging of the measured phase <b>deviation.</b> With an <b>FM</b> <b>deviation</b> of +/- 1 GHz, laboratory measurements were made for distances from 5 to 61 cm tip free space.

50|$|Frequency {{modulation}} or FM {{is a form}} of modulation which conveys {{information by}} varying the frequency of a carrier wave; the older amplitude modulation or AM varies the amplitude of the carrier, with its frequency remaining constant. With <b>FM,</b> frequency <b>deviation</b> from the assigned carrier frequency at any instant is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input signal, determining the instantaneous frequency of the transmitted signal. Because transmitted FM signals use more bandwidth than AM signals, this form of modulation is commonly used with the higher (VHF or UHF) frequencies used by TV, the FM broadcast band, and land mobile radio systems.|$|R

5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz <b>FM</b> <b>deviation.</b> The <b>FM</b> audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with high chroma levels can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|R

Many hybrid radios have an ERP that is lower than one half watt on channels 1-7, or can be set by the user to operate at low power on these channels. This allows hybrid radios to be used under the license free FRS rules if the ERP is less than one half watt and the unit is certified for FRS operation. Only two makers of hybrid FRS/GMRS radios (Garmin and Motorola) presently sell radios that will operate on the GMRS repeater channels; the common [...] "22 channel" [...] radios cannot be used with GMRS repeaters.

5000|$|One of the {{problems}} with the Armstrong method is that the frequency deviation—the amount of modulation—must be kept small to minimize distortion. [...] The maximum deviation is a fraction of 1 kilohertz, but FM broadcast requires 75 kilohertz deviation and a typical <b>FM</b> voice channel <b>deviation</b> is 5 kilohertz. To solve this problem, Armstrong multiplied the signal many times to a higher frequency to obtain the necessary deviation. For example, to generate an FM signal with 5 kilohertz deviation at 146.94 megahertz, the transmitter would generate a signal at 6.1225 megahertz with only 0.2 kilohertz deviation, and then multiply the signal 24 times.|$|R

This navigation algorithm blends various navigation data collected during terminal area approach of an instrumented helicopter. Navigation data collected include helicopter position and velocity from a global position system in differential mode (DGPS) {{as well as}} helicopter velocity and attitude from an inertial navigation system (INS). The goal of the navigation algorithm {{is to increase the}} DGPS accuracy while producing navigational data at the 64 Hertz INS update rate.

The design of the navigation algorithm resulted in a nine-state Kalman filter. The Kalman filter's state matrix contains position, velocity, and velocity bias components. The filter updates positional readings with DGPS position, INS velocity, and velocity bias information. In addition, the filter incorporates a sporadic data rejection scheme.

Functional outcome (BI, mRS) did not differ between treatment groups. Peripheral and central systolic BP, and heart rate, were 11. 2 mmHg (p= 0. 03), 9. 5 mmHg (p= 0. 04) and 7 beats/minute (p= 0. 02) higher respectively with amphetamine, compared with control. A non-significant reduction in myocardial perfusion (Buckberg Index) was seen with amphetamine. Other cardiac and cerebral haemodynamics were unaffected. Amphetamine did not improve motor impairment or function after ischaemic stroke but did significantly increase BP and heart rate without altering cerebral haemodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho aborda a conformidade dos medidores de energia em sistemas não senoidais, na busca do aumento de qualidade no faturamento de energia elétrica. Para tanto, enfoca a medição mais justa e um melhor relacionamento entre concessionária e consumidor. As análises foram {{realizadas}} nos laboratórios da Eletropaulo, do Instituto de Eletrotécnica e Energia da Universidade de São Paulo, e no Laboratório do Centro de Estudos em Regulação e Qualidade de Energia (Enerq), USP. Trata-se de um estudo que faz parte de um projeto maior de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL). Seu objetivo foi investigar se a distorção de tensão e corrente nos medidores de faturamento de energia elétrica provoca desvios na energia medida. Pretendeu-se ainda avaliar se as harmônicas inseridas nos medidores eletromecânicos possuem maior ou menor desvio na energia medida, em comparação aos medidores eletrônicos. A metodologia utilizada incluiu levantamento de estudos de pesquisa e desenvolvimento, além de ensaios de laboratório com amostras de equipamentos de dois fabricantes nacionais. Como parâmetros para os ensaios, levantaram-se curvas, por meio de medições de cargas reais. Os resultados das medições obtidas em situações reais foram comparados com aquelas levantadas nos laboratórios. Os resultados dos ensaios laboratoriais foram analisados e comparados com os limites estabelecidos nas normas vigentes, dentre as quais, destacam-se: o Regulamento Técnico Metrológico do INMETRO e os Procedimentos de Distribuição de Energia Elétrica no Sistema Elétrico Nacional PRODIST. O presente estudo concluiu que os instrumentos ensaiados em conforme normas, quando parametrizados para não considerar a potência de distorção no cálculo de reativo, atendem os parâmetros de exatidão. Esses dados são válidos tanto para as funções de VArh quanto para Wh. This work {{addresses the}} reliability of energy meters in nonsinusoidal systems, looking for the increase of quality in the electric energy billing. To that purpose, it focuses on a fairer metering and a better relationship between the concessionaire and consumer. The tests were carried through in the laboratories of Eletropaulo, of the Electro-Technology and Energy Institute in the University of São Paulo, and in the Laboratory of the Center of Studies in Power Quality Regulation (Enerq), USP. This study {{is part of a}} bigger project in Research and Development of the Electric Energy National Agency (Aneel). Its objective was to investigate whether the distortion of voltage and current in the electric energy billing <b>meters</b> had <b>deviations</b> in the <b>metered</b> energy. It was also intended to evaluate whether the inserted harmonics in the electromechanical meters have greater or minor <b>deviation</b> in the <b>metered</b> energy, in comparison to the electronic meters. The methodology used included a survey of studies, research and development of the electric sector, besides laboratory tests with two national equipment samples. As parameters for the tests, wave were formulated by means of real load metering. The results of the metering obtained in real situations were compared with those collected in the laboratories. The results of the laboratory tests were analyzed and compared with the limits established in the norms in force, amongst which one highlights: the Technical Metrological Regulation from Inmetro and the Electric Power Distribution Procedures in the National Electric System Prodist. The present study concluded the instruments analyzed under normalized conditions, when parameterized to not consider the distortion power in the calculation of reactive, meet the 60 Hz frequency, within the accuracy parameters. These data are valid both for the VArh functions and the Wh...|$|R
