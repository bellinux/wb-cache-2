40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{of organic}} particles from supercritical fluids (SF) by expansion (SFX) {{has become an}} interesting alternative to milling without thermal decomposition. Through the rapid-expansion process, a dramatic change of the solute supersaturation ratio is created causing subsequent precipitation with a narrow particle size distribution. It was found that β-carotene precipitates from SF ethylene and ethane have the feed material crystallinity. However, SF CO₂ reacted with β -carotene and did not give characteristic β -carotene X-ray spectra. The mean particle sizes of these precipitates were in the submicron range (ca. 0. 3 μm). Increased solubility was obtained by addition of toluene as co-solvent in SF ethylene. It {{was found that the}} mean size of β -carotene particles, generally remained unchanged if the toluene concentration was less than one and one-half mole percent. The GAS (Gas Anti-Solvent) process, wherein a high pressure gas is dissolved in a liquid solvent, thus precipitating a solid, has successfully been applied to recrystallize some difficult-to-comminute materials. It is essential to obtain the experimental solubility of the high pressure gas in the liquid solvent in order to model the GAS recrystallization process. A new method to measure compressed gas solubility and solvent expansion behavior was developed using a high precision densitometer. Theoretical predictions of phase equilibria and solubility of the compressed gas dissolved in the liquid solvent for three binary asymmetric systems was done in this study. Solids precipitation from liquid solvents, using dissolution of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>CO₂</b> as an anti-solvent to create supersaturation, is a potentially attractive crystallization process. Separation and purification of β -carotene mixtures was done in this study by this anti-solvent salting out technique. It was found that total carotene was successfully separated from epoxy oxides, as well as trans β -carotene from cis isomers. The separation can be carried out in batch or continuous modes. It is suggested that the purification (or fractionation) of an isomer mixture might be done using a mixed solvent if the desired compound dissolves in a highly expanded solvent and the undesired compound dissolves in a less expanded solvent...|$|E

40|$|Nanoporous {{carbonaceous}} {{materials are}} used in many varied applications, including adsorption (e. g. CO₂ capture and hydrogen storage) and catalysis (e. g. oxidation and dehydration). The non-carbon atoms (or heteroatoms) of carbonaceous materials profoundly affects their character and performance in such applications. For example, the level of oxygen within the predominately carbon skeleton of these materials is known to dictate their mechanical and thermal stability. The performance of nanoporous carbons in CO₂ adsorption is, on the other hand, {{known to be a}} strong function of the nitrogen (and other basic) functionalities on their pore surfaces. There are a wide variety of experimental methods available for determining the bulk and pore surface chemistry of carbonaceous materials. Due to the different underlying fundamentals of these methods, they can yield inconsistent results for what are nominally the same characteristics. This makes interpretation of experimentally observed behaviour of carbon materials challenging. The first aim of the research reported in this thesis is to distinguish the source of inconsistencies between the major methods for characterizing the oxygen chemistry of carbons. It is shown that differences in the results of the methods have a range of origins including spatial heterogeneity within carbon particles induced by diffusion-controlled activation, the differences in the probed volumes (e. g. bulk vs. surface), and in handling protocols prior to analysis. The second major aspect of the thesis is focused on better understanding the effect that pore structure and surface nitrogen chemistry have on the CO₂ capture performance of nanoporous carbons. Hence, samples with different porous structures are modified with amination which is believed to have enhancing effect on the surface basicity without diminishing the structure. The simultaneous effects of nitrogen content and pore structure on the low, atmospheric and <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>CO₂</b> capture performance of nanoporous carbons are analysed. It is shown that for low and atmospheric CO₂ capture, both N content and microporous structure have positive impact. However, at high pressures, nitrogen content seems to lose its enhancing effect and porous structure determines the capture performance. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Geological {{sequestration}} of CO₂ is {{an option}} to either mitigate or defer global warming and avoid dangerous climate change. Carbon dioxide is also injected into reservoirs to increase resource extraction. Currently, the rate of CO₂ injection in pilot sequestration plants or the enhanced oil recovery commercial projects is a few million tons CO₂ per year at best, while {{there are tens of}} billion tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. These sequestration projects will have a tangible impact only if they can be scaled up, which will require a solid understanding of the underlying physics and a portfolio of monitoring tools to curb operation risks and the potential of leakage. In this thesis I describe work that bears on three aspects of these complicated issues: Experiments and a new computational model on the reactive flow of carbonic acid in limestone, an assessment of the surface uplift owing to sequestration of CO₂ in a carbonate saline aquifer, and a validation of a new, real-time, tomography method that monitors the velocity change resulting from hydraulic fracturing. In Chapter 2, a network approach that models the formation of wormholes from reactive flow of high concentration carbonic acid in limestone is devised. In this model, the pore space is partitioned into two parts, the bigger subset of the pore network as a leading sub-network while the reminder of porosity comprises a set of identical secondary sub-networks: the reactive flow problem is framed as the competition of reactive fluid among these sub-networks. This approach saves computational resources by approximating the large fraction of slowly changing part of the pore space as a number of identical coarse networks. Using material constants appropriate to the conditions of the experiments, the model successfully grows wormholes that are as large as a fraction of a millimeter big in diameter from micron scale heterogeneity, and matches results obtained in laboratory experiments. In Chapter 3, the surface deformation from the injection of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>CO₂</b> in Nisku carbonate formation in Alberta, Canada is simulated with a coupled model of two-phase flow and geomechanics. The fact that the injected CO₂ is dry and the analyses of the flow field predict upper bounds of 2 percent stiffness decrease and 2 fold permeability increase when the injection rate in the horizontal pipe is 0. 2 Mt/km/yr. Simulation with a constitutive law that incorporates these estimates shows the difference between the surface uplift from the injection in the carbonate reservoir and the poroelastic response are negligible given the resolution of geodetic observations. A simple poroelastic model is adequate to infer the migration of subsurface CO₂ for carbonate reservoirs as tight as the Nisku formation for {{the first five years of}} injection. In Chapter 4, a real time tomography method that monitors the change of velocity structure from hydraulic fracturing is presented. A data set is synthesized from forward simulation of the simultaneous occurrence of micro-seismic events and evolution of velocity structure. The new method adapted from Algebraic Reconstruction Technique successfully estimated the changes in the contour and extent of the low-velocity fracture zone with time. by Haoyue Wang. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Adsorption-based methods, such as {{pressure}} swing adsorption (PSA) or vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), {{are promising}} for capturing CO₂ from natural gas or flue gas. CO₂ adsorbents take a variety of forms, but one approach {{is the use of}} metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These have attracted tremendous attention over the past decade due their porosity, high surface area, high pore volume, tuneable pore sizes and topologies. Previous studies on adsorbents of this type, such as CPO- 27 (Mg), HKUST- 1, MOF- 177 or MIL- 101, have reported good CO₂ adsorption capacities. Moreover, through introducing specific polar groups onto the organic linker or by grafting components onto coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) of specific MOFs, increases in the CO₂ affinity have been observed, particularly at low pressure. This project investigated the potential of MOFs for post-combustion carbon capture and high pressure separation processes. Two classes of MOFs were chosen: 1) MOFs containing CUS, which allow further postsynthetic modification (PSM) by grafting/impregnating these materials with amines. 2) Flexible MOFs, due to their good selectivities and high CO₂ capacities. Enhanced CO₂ capacities were sought by two approaches or a combination of both: (i) prefunctionalisation of MIL- 53 and MIL- 101 (where substituent groups are incorporated into the linker unit before MOF construction) and (ii) postsynthetic modification (PSM) of MIL- 100 and MIL- 101 (where substituents like ethylenediamine (ED), diethylenetriamine (DETA), 2 nd generation polypropylenimine actamine dendrimer (DAB-AM- 8) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) are added after MOF construction). In {{the first part of this}} study, MIL- 100 /MIL- 110 (Al), MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂, MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂, MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ and STA- 16 (Co) were synthesised and characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), elemental analysis, N₂ sorption at - 196 °C, helium density, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal decomposition. Despite the highly acidic environment during the preparation of MIL- 100 (Al), a 60 : 40 mixture with MIL- 110 (Al) was obtained in all cases. The formation of STA- 16 was found to be strongly dependent on the pH. Slight changes in the pH resulted in the formation of a mixture with or pure phase of a new polymorphous MOF, denoted here as CoMOF. In contrast to the microporous character of STA- 16 (Co), CoMOF is non-porous and therefore not applicable for CO₂ capture. For this reason, no PSM on the CUS of MIL- 100 /MIL- 110 (Al) and STA- 16 (Co) were conducted. In the second part of this study, all MOFs (except CoMOF) were evaluated for their ability to capture CO₂ by measuring adsorption equilibria in the temperature range of 25 to 75 / 105 °C and a pressure range of 0 to 0. 5 bar which is appropriate to the VSA process for post-combustion capture. Among them, MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ was found to have the highest CO₂ adsorption capacity in the studied pressure and temperature range, while the MOFs containing CUS showed lower adsorption capacities. In order to improve the capacities of MOFs containing CUS, PSM of MIL- 100 (Fe) and MIL- 101 (Cr/Al) -NH₂ were performed. Despite slower kinetics after the modification of the MIL- 101 -NH₂ frameworks, higher adsorption capacities were observed at pressures below 0. 15 bar over the entire temperature range evaluated. A smaller impact of ED and DETA relative to PEI and DAB-AM- 8 was expected due to the lower amine densities. However in comparison with the MOFs prior to PSM, the adsorption capacities were mostly lower or similar, suggesting that most of the amine groups inside the pores are not accessible for CO₂. In other words, the results suggest that most of the pores were blocked. The maximum loadings of the amines used in this work were 150 wt% and 100 wt% for MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂ and MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂, respectively. The best performing materials were MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂-DAB-AM- 8 - 145 and MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂-PEI- 96. Despite the promising results for MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂ containing 96 wt% PEI, the similar loadings of DAB-AM- 8 (94 wt%) and DETA (88 wt%) resulted in complete pore filling and consequent reductions in CO₂ adsorption capacities at low pressures. While PSM of MIL- 101 frameworks showed promising results, the increase in CO₂ adsorption capacity in PSM MIL- 100 (Fe) was relatively limited. One reason for this is the lower pore volume of the latter MOF, which decreases the amount of amine that can be incorporated. It was also found that the ED modified MIL- 100 (Fe) performed better than the PEI modified analogue; this result is probably due to the smaller size of ED in comparison with PEI. The comparison with the adsorption capacities of DAB-AM- 8, DETA and PEI revealed that only MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂-DAB-AM- 8 - 145 and MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂-PEI- 96 showed higher CO₂ capacities than those of the neat amines and the parent MOF. In the third part of this study, the stability of these MOFs under cycling conditions and in the presence of moisture (1 vol% H₂O) was tested, since this would be essential for industrial applications. Instability in the presence of H₂O is a known problem for many MOFs, since phase transformations and/or decomposition of the framework structure can occur. Due to the slower CO 2 adsorption/desorption kinetics at lower temperatures on MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂-PEI- 68 / 88 / 130, MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂-DAB-AM- 8 - 145 and amine modified MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂, the cycling experiments were performed at 75 or 105 °C. The cycling temperature of DETA and ED modified MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂ was set to 45 °C. Other materials were cycled at 25 °C. The working capacities in each cycle of the PSM materials were lower or similar to those of the parent materials. One exception was MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂-DAB-AM- 8 - 145 which outperformed MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂. The improvement in working capacity and cycling at somewhat elevated temperature can be beneficial for post-combustion capture, since the temperature of the flue gas to be treated is often elevated also. The presence of amines resulted in decreased H₂O capacities due to the lower pore volumes. Significant decreases in the performance of MIL- 100 (Fe) were found during the wet cycling processes due the progressive filling of the pores by H₂O. PXRD studies showed that MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂, MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 100 (Fe) -ED and MIL- 100 (Fe) -PEI remained stable in the presence of H₂O. In contrast to this, MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂ remained stable during the wet cycling experiments, but exhibited partial decomposition when H₂O desorbed upon heating at 110 °C in Ar atmosphere. While MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ exhibited a working capacity of 2. 88 wt% under dry conditions, H₂O was found to almost completely disable the CO₂ adsorption/desorption during cycling. Improvements were sought by PSM with benzoic anhydride. Due to the size of the anhydride, the working capacity was reduced to 0. 37 wt% under dry conditions. The presence of H₂O resulted in further reduction of the working capacity to 0. 08 wt% in the PSM material. Despite the decrease in working capacities both neat and PSM materials were stable during the wet cycling process. In the third part of this study, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>CO₂</b> and N₂ adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on MIL- 100 /MIL- 110 (Al), MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 101 (Cr/Al) -NH₂ and STA- 16 frameworks in the temperature range of 25 to 105 °C and pressure range of 0 to 40 bar. All materials were found to selectively adsorb CO₂, with relatively high CO₂ adsorption capacities observable in the MIL- 101 frameworks. The hydrothermal stability of selected MOFs was evaluated by measuring CO₂ isotherms before and after the treatment with H₂O vapour (30, 60 and 90 % RH). While MIL- 100 /MIL- 110 (Al) and MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂ showed decreases in the CO₂ uptake after the treatment with H₂O at 30 % RH, the phosphonate framework STA- 16 (Co) remained stable up to 60 % RH. PXRD studies revealed that the lower CO₂ adsorption capacities are due to the collapse of the MIL- 110 (Al) and MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂ frameworks. In contrast to MIL- 110, the diffraction pattern of MIL- 100 (Al) remained unchanged. Structural changes were observed in STA- 16 (Co) after the adsorption of H₂O at 90 % RH; and this also resulted in a small decrease in CO₂ capacity from 13. 2 wt% to 12. 5 wt% at 25 °C and 5 bar. In the last part of this study, the effect of flue gas impurities on the stability and the CO₂ uptake of MIL- 101 (Cr), MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂, MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂, MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ and STA- 16 (Co) were evaluated by performing PXRD and FTIR studies, screening tests and a series of cycling experiments using NO, NO₂ and SO₂. The MOFs were chosen in order to determine the effects of the CUS, flexible vs rigid frameworks, the type of metal cation and the nature of the organic linker molecule. In order to determine the effect of NO, NO₂ and SO₂ on the stability of the MOFs, PXRD studies were conducted after the materials had been subjected to 10000 ppm contaminant at 25 °C and at elevated temperatures (50, 80 °C). Decreased crystallinities and therefore partial loss in long-range crystallographic ordering or partially collapsed structures were observed in all MOFs. This suggests that the frameworks might ultimately collapse upon prolonged exposure to all contaminants examined. MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ was found to be flexible upon NO₂ adsorption, with a transformation from narrow pore (np) to large pore (lp) form taking place. STA- 16 (Co) was partially transformed into CoMOF after NO and SO₂ exposure, while NO₂ resulted in a complete collapse of the framework. FTIR studies of the samples after the exposure indicated that NO₂ is strongly interacting with the CUS in MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 101 (Cr), MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂, MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂ and STA- 16 (Co). During the screening tests, the MOFs were subjected to 5000 ppm of contaminant over a heat ramp from 20 to 110 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min- 1. The peak mass change in the majority of the MOFs was found at 50 °C for NO and SO₂ and at 80 °C for NO₂. The effect of contaminant concentration was investigated by exposing the samples to the contaminants by varying the partial pressures between 0 and 500 ppm (NO, NO₂) or 2000 ppm (SO₂) or 5000 ppm (NO, NO₂, SO₂) until five cycles of adsorption and desorption were conducted at 25 °C. With increasing concentration of the contaminants an increase in mass uptake was observed. The presence of CUS in MIL- 101 (Cr), MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂, MIL- 101 (Al) -NH₂, MIL- 100 (Fe) and STA- 16 (Co) resulted in a strong interaction with 5000 ppm NO₂ and irreversible adsorption. In contrast to this, the adsorption of NO₂ in MIL- 53 (Al) -NH₂ was completely reversible due to the flexibility of the framework. The impact of the contaminants on the ability to capture CO₂ was investigated by varying the CO₂ partial pressures between 0. 05 and 0. 15 bar while simultaneously varying the contaminant partial pressures between 0 and 500 ppm (NO, NO₂) or 2000 ppm (SO₂) during five cycle experiments at 25 °C. The CO₂ working capacities in the presence of the contaminants were diminished in most cases, suggesting that the removal of NO, NO₂ and SO₂ is required prior to the capture process. In summary, a series of MOFs were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for their utility in CO₂ capture processes. Amine modifications were shown to increase the CO₂ adsorption capacities; however the impact of the amine groups varied between the studied MOFs. It was found that an improvement in CO₂ adsorption capacities in MOFs with smaller pore volumes can be achieved by introducing smaller amines (ED), while PEI and/or DAB-AM- 8 had a bigger impact on the MOFs with a larger pore volume. Decreases in working capacities were observed in the majority of the materials tested, although the stability of most materials was confirmed by PXRD measurements after wet cycling. Furthermore, the presence of flue gas contaminants was found to have a big impact on the CO₂ uptakes and the stability of the frameworks. Therefore, the application of the MOFs studied here for post-combustion capture is seen to be limited. However, the high H₂O uptakes in MIL- 100 (Fe), MIL- 101 (Cr) -NH₂ and STA- 16 (Co) suggest that these materials might be useful as H₂O sorbents. Furthermore, the good performance during <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>CO₂</b> sorption experiments makes the MOFs good candidates for applications where high pressure separation processes can be utilised...|$|E

40|$|We studied {{equilibrium}} adsorption and uptake kinetics {{and identified}} molecular species that formed during sorption {{of carbon dioxide}} on amine-modified silica. Bicontinuous silicas (AMS- 6 and MCM- 48) were postsynthetically modified with (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane or (3 -aminopropyl) methyldiethoxysilane, and amine-modified AMS- 6 adsorbed more CO(2) than did amine-modified MCM- 48. By in situ FTIR spectroscopy, we showed that the amine groups reacted with CO(2) and formed ammonium carbamate ion pairs as well as carbamic acids under both dry and moist conditions. The carbamic acid was stabilized by hydrogen bonds, and ammonium carbamate ion pairs formed preferably on sorbents with high densities of amine groups. Under dry conditions, silylpropylcarbamate formed, slowly, by condensing carbamic acid and silanol groups. The ratio of ammonium carbamate ion pairs to silylpropylcarbamate was higher for samples with high amine contents than samples with low amine contents. Bicarbonates or carbonates did not form under dry or moist conditions. The uptake of CO(2) was enhanced {{in the presence of}} water, which was rationalized by the observed release of additional amine groups under these conditions and related formation of ammonium carbamate ion pairs. Distinct evidence for a fourth and irreversibly formed moiety was observed under sorption of CO(2) under dry conditions. Significant amounts of physisorbed, linear CO(2) were detected at relatively <b>high</b> partial <b>pressures</b> of <b>CO(2),</b> such that they could adsorb only after the reactive amine groups were consumed. authorCount : 7 </p...|$|R
5000|$|This {{reaction}} {{takes place}} at 900 °C (1650 °F; at which temperature the partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO2</b> is 1 atmosphere), but a temperature around 1000 °C (1800 °F; at which temperature the partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO2</b> is 3.8 atmospheres) is usually {{used to make the}} reaction proceed quickly.

50|$|The {{first time}} that the cap is removed from the bottle, the {{pressure}} inside the bottle equalizes with the ambient atmospheric pressure. More importantly, however, after the outside air is allowed to mix with the gas inside the bottle the headspace no longer contains pure CO2. Thus the partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO2</b> is substantially reduced, from 2 atmospheres to the partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO2</b> in the Earth's atmosphere, which is approximately 0.0003 atmospheres. In accordance with Henry's Law, the excess CO2 dissolved in the drink comes out of solution. Eventually it reaches a new dynamic equilibrium state, with a much lower partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO2</b> in the headspace and thus a much lower amount of CO2 held in solution.|$|R

50|$|Pressurised CO2 in the keg's {{headspace}} maintains carbonation in the beer. The <b>CO2</b> <b>pressure</b> varies {{depending on}} the amount of CO2 already in the beer and the keg storage temperature. Occasionally the CO2 gas is blended with nitrogen gas. CO2 / nitrogen blends are used to allow a <b>higher</b> operating <b>pressure</b> in complex dispensing systems.|$|R
5000|$|A third process, {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} extraction, combines the best aspects {{of the other two}} methods. When carbon dioxide is put under at least [...] of pressure and at a temperature of at least 31.1 C (the critical point), it becomes a supercritical fluid with the permeation properties of a gas and the solvation properties of a liquid. (Under normal <b>pressure</b> <b>CO2</b> changes directly from a solid to a gas in a process known as sublimation.) The supercritical fluid CO2 extracts the aromatics from the plant material.|$|R

Approximately 2 months into the ISS mission, the astronaut reported a progressive decrease in his near and far acuity in both eyes. The ISS cabin <b>pressure,</b> <b>CO2</b> and O2 levels were reported to be within normal operating limits and the astronaut was not exposed to any toxic substances. He never experienced losses in subjective best-corrected acuity, color vision or stereopsis. A fundus examination revealed a grade 1 bilateral optic-disc edema and choroidal folds (Figure 15).|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{projected}} to increase ocean temperatures by at least 2 °C, and levels of pH by ~ 0. 2 units (ocean acidification, OA) {{by the end of}} this century. While the effects of these stressors on marine organisms have been relatively well explored in isolation, possible interactions between temperature and OA have yet to be thoroughly investigated. OA at levels projected to occur within this century has few direct ecological effects on the early life history stages of corals. In contrast, temperature has pronounced effects on many stages in the early life history of corals. Here, we test whether temperature might act in combination with OA to produce a measurable ecological effect on fertilization, development, larval survivorship or metamorphosis of 2 broadcast spawning species, Acropora millepora and A. tenuis, from the Great Barrier Reef. We used 4 treatments: control, high temperature (+ 2 °C), <b>high</b> partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>CO₂</b> (pCO₂) (700 µatm) and a combination of high temperature and high pCO₂, corresponding to the current levels of these variables and the projected values for the end of this century under the IPCC A 2 scenario. We found no consistent effect of elevated pCO₂ on fertilization, development, survivorship or metamorphosis, neither alone nor in combination with temperature. In contrast, a 2 °C rise in temperature increased rates of development, but otherwise had no consistent effect on fertilization, survivorship or metamorphosis. We conclude that OA is unlikely to be a direct threat to the early life history stages of corals, at least in the near future. In contrast, rising sea temperatures are likely to affect coral population dynamics by increasing the rate of larval development with resulting changes in patterns of connectivity...|$|R
