The study tested whether such a program could be successfully carried out and whether it <b>could</b> <b>effect</b> <b>changes</b> in knowledge, attitudes, and food purchasing behavior in line with nutrition and cancer risk reduction guidelines. METHODS. The evaluation consisted of an in-store monitoring element, an in-store and telephone consumer survey, and an analysis of sales data on selected foods. A matched-pair design, using a total of 40 stores in the intervention and comparison groups, was used. RESULTS. The intervention was successfully implemented and had limited success in changing some food purchasing behaviors. There appeared to be no effect on knowledge and attitudes except for increased awareness of a link between diet and cancer and of the program itself. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the intervention's success, limitations of the consumer survey and sales data analyses and the continuing diffusion of nutrition messages throughout society {{make it difficult to}} specify the impact of this program on consumer nutrition knowledge and behaviors...|$|R

Method: In order to achieve this, {{a modified version of the}} EBCD methodology (Bate & Robert, 2006) was undertaken, which involved listening to the experiences of the people who work in and used the mental health setting and sharing these experiences with the people who <b>could</b> <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> within the service, through collaborative work between service-users, staff and managers. Results: EBCD was implemented within the mental health setting and was well received by service-users, staff, and stakeholders.

Using the Provincial Education Program of Studies, the school board’s Three Year Plan and the individual school’s School Development Plan as a starting point, I look to understand the structure and the philosophy of the organization that I work within.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies have {{demonstrated}} {{links between the}} accessibility of food and multiple health outcomes. Policymakers engaged in local community development may use public health concerns as a strategy to procure funding for food retail initiatives. Few studies to date {{have demonstrated}} the impact that a new food retailer can have on geographic and economic access to nutritious food in a community, evidence which could support the case for new food retail. This paper examines the price and availability of food {{before and after the}} opening of two new grocery stores in a former food desert in Flint, Michigan. The results indicate a substantial improvement in both geographic and economic food accessibility, and show no statistical difference between prices at average grocery stores and the new stores. Discussion suggests that investment in poorer neighborhoods can be beneficial to the local population and the community at large by creating a local multiplier effect through increased spending in the community. The evolution of North American food retailing has created gaps in the community food environment in some urban neighborhoods. Furey, Strugnell, and McIlveen (2001) discuss how social, economic, and health-related consequences combine to create social exclusion among residents living in these “food deserts. ” Food retailers <b>could</b> <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> in food environments...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{supportive}} evidence, {{the debate}} continues {{as to whether}} public health communication can change health behavior. Early community-based trials such as the Stanford Five City Program 1 and COMMIT 2 produced ambiguous or no evidence that health communication affected health-risk behaviors. But other research began to appear that demonstrated that such communication <b>could</b> <b>effect</b> <b>change.</b> 3 This supportive evidence, along with the articles cited below in this volume, demonstrates that behavior change did occur {{in the context of}} community-wide campaigns such as the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, 4 the California and Massachusetts antismoking campaigns, 5, 6 the North Carolina highway safety program, 7 and others. The editor of this reader, Public Health Communication, espouses the hypothesis that public health communica-tion can change health behaviors, and his selection of international research supports this. The collection of 19 papers assembled in this volume address the evidence for change in signifi-cant ways. The editor explains that his three major criteria in selecting the papers demonstrate (a) strong evidence of change in specific health behavior at a population level; (b) major exposure of the population to public health communication messages concerning that behavior; and (c) coher-ent evidence and a sensible narrative that attributes the change, at least in part, to the communica...|$|R

The country, in 1965, was still reeling after the catastrophe of the demolition of the Euston Arch in London, the monumental portico of the world’s first capital city railway terminus.

The present study explores the influences (ideas, experiences, and relationships) that shape six African American young adults' beliefs that they should and can <b>effect</b> <b>change</b> in their neighborhood. Many of these young people [...] all former participants in a youth-development program [...] exhibited the capacity to critically examine their worlds and develop plans to <b>effect</b> <b>change,</b> deep commitments to be change-agents in their community, and strong leadership skills. Framed by the concepts of transformative agency, coalitional agency, and critical consciousness, the study aimed to explore the roots of their beliefs about, commitments toward, and experiences of <b>effecting</b> <b>change.</b> The scope of this study appreciates the long-term and multifaceted nature of becoming an agent of social change in which identity and influence are rooted in a layered sense of belonging. Scholars have paid relatively little attention to how social contexts and processes influence youths' long-term beliefs and commitments about contributing to and shaping society (Bajaj, 2009; Hart & Fegley, 1995; Watts & Guessous, 2006), and this study's findings surface the complex meaning making and social processes that fed into the young adults' beliefs that they should and <b>could</b> <b>effect</b> <b>change.</b> The young men and women highlighted the importance of exploring and claiming a rich cultural identity rooted in an African American counternarrative of courage and struggle.

When describing the experiences through which they came to learn and embrace these commitments, the young adults pointed to relationships, group expectations, and concrete experiences of <b>effecting</b> <b>change</b> that took place within the youth-development program.
