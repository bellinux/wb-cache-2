In the first report to identify natural immunomodulators capable of down-regulating MHC class I expression in situ in a normal, neuroectoderm-derived human tissue, we show that ectopic MHC class I expression in human anagen hair bulbs can be normalized by treatment with α-MSH, IGF- 1, or TGF-β 1, all of which are locally generated, as well as by FK 506.

Most studies investigating quantitative HBsAg were performed in HBV mono-infected patients. However, the immune status {{is considered to be}} important for HBsAg decline and subsequent HBsAg loss. HIV co-infection unfavorably influences the course of chronic hepatitis B. In this cross-sectional study we investigated quantitative HBsAg in 173 HBV/HIV co-infected patients from 6 centers and evaluated the importance of immunodeficiency and antiretroviral therapy. We also compared 46 untreated HIV/HBV infected patients with 46 well-matched HBV mono-infected patients. HBsAg levels correlated with CD 4 T-cell count and were higher in patients with more advanced HIV CDC stage. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including nucleos(t) ide analogues active against HBV demonstrated significant lower HBsAg levels compared to untreated patients. Importantly, HBsAg levels were significantly lower in patients who had a stronger increase between nadir CD 4 and current CD 4 T-cell count during cART. Untreated HIV/HBV patients demonstrated higher HBsAg levels than HBV mono-infected patients despite similar HBV DNA levels. In conclusion, HBsAg decline is dependent on an effective <b>immune</b> status. <b>Restoration</b> of CD 4 T-cells during treatment with cART including nucleos(t) ide analogues seems to be important for HBsAg decrease and subsequent HBsAg loss...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory T cells (Tregs) {{serve as}} {{negative}} regulators of T cell activation {{and play a}} crucial role in maintaining peripheral tolerance and regulating autoimmunity. In cancer, Tregs are implicated in the control of inflammation but mainly contribute to tumor escape.

Understanding the diverse role of Tregs and mapping relations with other cell types or microbiome organisms in various cancers, as well as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is of paramount importance as there is need for novel combinatorial immunomodulatory strategies against cancer.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which {{destruction of the}} beta cells in the islets of Langerhans results in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. We only definitely know that autoimmunity {{is the most important}} effector mechanism of type 1 DM. Type 1 DM precipitates in genetically susceptible individuals after an exposure to environmental trigger. According to current data, type 1 DM-associated genes are classified as susceptibility and protective genes. This insidious disease process evolves over a period of years. Prevention of type 1 DM requires detection of the earliest events in the process. Until now, autoantibodies are generally used as a serum biomarker, but current studies about T cell and metabolome might strengthen diagnostic view. Current preventive clinical studies usually focus on environmental factors. During the natural course of type 1 DM, many strategies have been tested at different stages in the form of primary, secondary and tertiary studies. The aim of the intervention studies for type 1 diabetes is to suppress pathogenic autoreactivity, restore/preserve beta cell mass and function to sufficient levels to provide good metabolic control, and to delay or prevent disease development.

40|$|Chemokines and {{chemokine}} receptors {{promote the}} migration of immune cells during infectious stimuli as well as under homeostatic conditions. In chronic disease, chemokines can also promote influx of cells that contributes to pathological inflammation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative sense RNA virus that is {{the primary cause of}} hospitalization in {{children under the age of}} 2. Pathologic immune responses are thought to be responsible for RSV-associated disease. This study investigated the role of two chemokine receptors, CC chemokine receptors 6 and 7 (CCR 6 and CCR 7), expressed by leukocytes, in the immune response to RSV infection. Animals deficient in CCR 6 and infected with RSV had enhanced viral clearance, diminished mucus production, and generated a protective Th 1 effector T cell response in comparison to wild-type mice. The tempered pathological response in CCR 6 -/- animals was due to the impaired recruitment of dendritic cells (DC) in the lung, which promoted Th 2 cytokines and mucus production when adoptively transferred into CCR 6 -/- mice. Conversely, CCR 7 -/-animals infected with RSV exhibited an exacerbated, dysregulated effector T cell response in the lung as a result of impaired migration of cells to the lymph nodes and thus local priming of the <b>immune</b> response. <b>Restoration</b> of <b>immune</b> cell trafficking to the lymph nodes in bone marrow chimeras reestablished effector T cell responses and abrogated local pathology.

This thesis investigated the effects on extinction of a novel procedure, retrieval – extinction training, reported to yield reductions in fear responding <b>immune</b> to <b>restoration.</b> The first series of experiments used auditory fear conditioning to study the effects of retrieval – extinction on renewal and reinstatement preparations. A single retrieval trial prior to extinction training augmented renewal and reinstatement. Augmentation of renewal was absent if retrieval and extinction training occurred in different contexts. The second series of experiments used auditory and contextual fear conditioning, while varying unconditioned stimulus intensity during training and retraining, to study the effects of retrieval – extinction on reacquisition of conditioned fear. A single retrieval trial prior to extinction training augmented reacquisition of conditioned responding, especially when initial contextual fear learning was strong. These results show that retrieval – extinction training does not reduce restoration of conditioned fear after extinction and show that under some conditions such restoration can be augmented. These results are interpreted with reference to: 1) the influences of occasion setting contextual associations versus direct context – CS associations formed {{as a consequence of the}} retrieval trial; 2) discrimination between acquisition, extinction, and test phases of the experiment; 3) the beneficial effects of prior fear memory retrieval on later fear memory retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Anti-inflammatory {{properties}} of cacao, fruits of Theobroma cacao L. (Sterculiaceae), are well documented, and therapeutic applications are described for gastrointestinal, nervous and cardiovascular abnormalities. Most, {{if not all}} of these disease conditions involve inflammation or immune activation processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and related biochemical pathways like tryptophan breakdown by indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) and neopterin formation are deeply involved in their pathogenesis. Neopterin concentrations and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp, an estimate of IDO activity) are elevated in a significant proportion of patients with virus infections, cancer, autoimmune syndrome, neurodegeneration and coronary artery disease. Moreover, higher neopterin and Kyn/Trp concentrations are indicative for poor prognosis. When investigating the effect of aqueous or ethanolic extracts of cacao on IFN-γ, neopterin and Kyn/Trp concentrations in mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, breakdown of tryptophan by IDO and formation of neopterin and IFN-γ were dose-dependently suppressed. The effects observed in the cell-based assays are associated with the antioxidant activity of the cacao extracts as determined by the cell-free oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) assay. The influence of cacao extracts on IDO activity could be of particular relevance for some of the beneficial health effects ascribed to cacao: tryptophan breakdown by IDO is strongly involved in immunoregulation, and the diminished availability of tryptophan limits the biosynthesis of neurotransmitter serotonin. The inhibition of tryptophan breakdown by cacao constituents could thus be relevant not only for <b>immune</b> system <b>restoration</b> in patients, but also contribute to mood elevation and thereby improve quality of life.
