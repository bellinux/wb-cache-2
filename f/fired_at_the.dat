5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated.

Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further.

The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, because she had steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and Texas <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.|$|E

She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed.

5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were fired at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants.
