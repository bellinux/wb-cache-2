5000|$|Many {{theories}} of the cause of PD symptoms point {{to the death of}} <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> within the central nervous system due to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is caused by metabolism and the production of molecules known as free radicals. Accumulation of these free radicals within the brain can cause damage to neurons. Additionally, dopamine producing neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the relatively high levels of metabolism associated with the production of dopamine, resulting in comparatively higher amounts of free radicals being produced by these <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons.</b> [...] The effects of dopamine within the brain are widespread, including the control of voluntary motor control. With the death of these dopamine-producing cells within an area of the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra, the central nervous system has less control over the body, resulting in the tremors and rigidity seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{function}} of DJ- 1 (PARK 7) {{is associated with}} autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), {{one of the major}} age-related neurological diseases. In this study, we extended former studies on DJ- 1 knockout mice by identifying subtle morphological and behavioural phenotypes. The DJ- 1 gene trap-induced null mutants exhibit less <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). They also exhibit slight changes in behaviour, i. e. diminished rearing behaviour and impairments in object recognition. Furthermore, we detected subtle phenotypes, which suggest that these animals compensate for the loss of DJ- 1. First, we found a significant upregulation of mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities, a mechanism known to protect against oxidative stress. Second, a close to significant increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 phosphorylation in old DJ- 1 -deficient mice hints at a differential activation of neuronal cell survival pathways. Third, as no change in the density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive terminals in the striatum was observed, the remaining <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> likely compensate by increasing axonal sprouting. In summary, the present data suggest that DJ- 1 is implicated in major non-motor symptoms of PD appearing in the early phases of the disease-such as subtle impairments in motivated behaviour and cognition-and that under basal conditions the loss of DJ- 1 is compensated...|$|R

50|$|DRT {{has been}} used to improve motor skills, impulsivity, and {{decision}} making in Parkinson’s patients. In Parkinson’s Disease patients, dopamine deficiencies can be seen in two key areas of the brain: the dorsal frontostriatal circuit, the area responsible for motor skills and task-switching, and the ventral frontostriatal circuit, the area responsible for impulsivity. Impairment in these areas can be treated with dopamine agonists, a group of medications that mimics the ligand dopamine and bonds to dopamine receptors. Other medications that convert into dopamine, as opposed to functioning as dopamine analogs, alleviate the effects of the degeneration of <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons.</b> One dopamine precursor, Levodopa, was the first drug approved specifically for Parkinson’s disease. DRT increases dopamine in the brain to optimal levels in order to return motor skills, impulsivity, and decision making to normal function.

A key neuropathological characteristic of PD is a severe loss of <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the brainstem, which induces several core motor features such as bradykinesia and rigidity. The development of levodopa is a milestone in the treatment of PD, since it is inexpensive and very efficacious [2]. Levodopa is converted to dopamine which replenishes the stores of endogenous dopamine and induces a fast and significant improvement in motor function [3]. Due to disease progression, patients require higher daily dosages of levodopa to produce a stable clinical effect. Frequently, disabling side-effects in particular dyskinesias occur [4]. After 5 years of levodopa treatment, approximately 30 % to 40 % of patients suffer from dyskinesias, increasing to 40 % to 60 % after 10 years of treatment [5, 6]. Nevertheless, the pathophysiology of dyskinesias is still unknown.

The aim of our study was the in vivo measurement of these alterations using three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Methods: 21 patients with Parkinson’s disease and 24 controls were examined using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 3 Tesla. The spectra of rostral and caudal substantia nigra regions were analyzed using LCModel. For spectral fitting, an adjusted basis data set with pathology-specific metabolites and macromolecules was used to better reproduce the in vivo spectra. To assess differences between both groups more accurately, especially in metabolites at lower concentrations, group-averaged spectra were evaluated {{in addition to the}} analysis of individual data. Results: We found significantly decreased N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, myo-inositol, glutathione and dopamine concentrations in patients with Parkinson’s disease compared to controls, whereas glutamine+glutamate, c-aminobutyric acid, and homovanillic acid were slightly increased.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} movement disorder, {{characterized by}} the motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, postural instability and slowness of movement. These motor symptoms are caused {{by the death of}} the <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain, however the underlying cause of this selective neurodegeneration is unknown. Many lines of evidence support a causative role for mitochondria in this dopaminergic cell death, and specifically the inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain. Here we show that the specific removal of complex I function from the mouse does not produce a Parkinsonian loss of dopaminergic cell bodies, nor a loss of the dopamine-producing protein tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum. However, we did observe severe axonal dystrophy in dopaminergic axons, and a reduction of mitochondrial size consistent with decreased mitochondrial fusion, both of which are implicated in PD pathogenesis. These data suggest that the inhibition of complex I is not sufficient to account for the selective dopaminergic cell death of PD, but that it is consistent with a cooperative role in the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and the loss of dopaminergic axons...|$|R

The purpose of this integrated review is to summarize and appraise animal and human research studies focused on biological mechanisms, symptom, and health outcomes of psychological stress in PD. A search of the electronic databases PubMed/Medline and CINAHL from 1980 to the present using the key words Parkinson’s disease and stress, psychological stress, mental stress, and chronic stress resulted in 11 articles that met inclusion criteria.

Most forms of PD are sporadic, though in some cases familial inheritance is observed. In the late 1990 s, two mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene were linked to rare, autosomal dominant forms of PD.

Exogenous application of dopamine, as well as redistribution of vesicular dopamine to the cytoplasm, can be toxic to dopaminergic neurons. Thus, impaired neurotransmitter storage arising from mutations in alpha-synuclein could lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of dopamine.

Therefore, it is possible that lesions in nondopaminergic systems contribute to the pathophysiology of postural instability in PD. Such nondopaminergic lesions are well recognized, certainly in advanced stages of PD where postural instability and falls dominate the clinical presentation. However, it remains unclear which of the identified nondopaminergic lesions is specifically responsible for postural instability and balance impairment. In this review, we argue that cell loss in the locus coeruleus and a resultant central norepinephrine deficit are intimately involved in the pathophysiology of postural instability in PD. If proven to be correct, this link between defective noradrenergic neurotransmission and postural instability could have important implications for the future development of new symptomatic treatments aimed to correct postural instability and preventing falls. Studies in the next 5 years could test this hypothesis, using a battery of complementary research techniques, including advanced neuroimaging (structural, functional imaging and nuclear), neurochemical studies of cerebrospinal fluid, post-mortem clinicopathological analyses and detailed clinical balance evaluations supplemented by posturography studies...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in alpha-synuclein {{have been}} linked to rare, {{autosomal}} dominant forms of Parkinsons disease. Despite its ubiquitous expression, mutant alpha-synuclein primarily leads to the loss of <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the substantia nigra. Alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic nerve terminal protein of unknown function, though some studies suggest it is important for synapse formation and maintenance. The present study utilized a new human mesencephalic cell line, MESC 2. 10, to study the effect of A 53 T mutant alpha-synuclein on dopamine homeostasis. In addition to expressing markers of mature dopamine neurons, differentiated MESC 2. 10 cells are electrically active, produce dopamine, and express wild-type human alpha-synuclein. Lentivirus-induced overexpression of A 53 T mutant alpha-synuclein in differentiated MESC 2. 10 cells resulted in downregulation of the vesicular dopamine transporter (VMAT 2), decreased potassium-induced and increased amphetamine-induced dopamine release, enhanced cytoplasmic dopamine immunofluorescence, and increased intracellular levels of superoxide. These results suggest that mutant alpha-synuclein leads to an impairment in vesicular dopamine storage and consequent accumulation of dopamine in the cytosol, a pathogenic mechanism that underlies the toxicity of the psychostimulant amphetamine and the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium. Interestingly, cells expressing A 53 T mutant alpha-synuclein were resistant to amphetamine-induced toxicity. Since extra-vesicular, cytoplasmic dopamine can be easily oxidized into reactive oxygen species and other toxic metabolites, mutations in alpha-synuclein might lead to Parkinsons disease by triggering protracted, low-grade dopamine toxicity resulting in terminal degeneration and ultimately cell death...|$|R
40|$|Intracerebral {{transplantation}} of porcine embryonic <b>dopamine-producing</b> <b>neurons</b> {{has been}} suggested as a method to treat patients with Parkinson's disease. Even though the brain is an immunologically privileged site, neuronal xenografts are usually rejected within a few weeks. T cells are important for this process, but the exact cellular events leading to rejection are poorly characterized. Brain cells from ventral mesencephalon of 26 - 27 -day-old pig embryos were used as target cells in flow cytometry-assessed cytotoxicity assays using non- and IL- 2 -activated CD 3 - CD 16 + CD 56 + human natural killer (NK) cells as effector cells. The ability of human NK cells to kill pig embryonic brain cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) {{in the presence of}} nondepleted and anti-Gal alpha 1, 3 Gal antibody-depleted human blood group AB serum (AB serum) was evaluated using the same assay. Both nondepleted and anti-Gal alpha 1, 3 Gal antibody-depleted AB serum could mediate ADCC of pig embryonic VM cells when human NK cells were used as effector cells. Nonactivated NK cells did not show any direct cytotoxic effect on freshly isolated VM cells, whereas IL- 2 -activated NK cells killed approximately 50 % of the VM cells at an effector-to-target ratio of 50 : 1 in a 4 -h cytotoxicity assay. Activation of VM cells by TNF-alpha did not change their sensitivity to human NK cell cytotoxicity. Human NK cells may thus contribute to a cellular rejection of pig neuronal xenografts by ADCC, or following IL- 2 activation, by a direct cytotoxic effect...|$|R
