40|$|Process {{design of}} <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{involves}} {{the selection of}} the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine, mould design, production scheduling, cost estimation, and determination of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> parameters. An expert system approach has been rued to derive the process solution for <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> over the past few years. However, this approach is found to be incapable of determining the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> parameters owing to the fragile nature of the knowledge for setting the moulding parameters. In addition, the existing expert systems for process design lack proper architecture for organising heterogeneous knowledge sources.

40|$|Purpose: Development {{of a new}} {{generation}} tool materials on the basis of high speed-steel manufactured by Powder <b>Injection</b> <b>Moulding.</b> To investigate formability of the polymer-powder slurry in which the HS 12 - 1 - 5 - 5 (T 15) high-speed steel powder was used, as well as the HD-PE polyethylene and paraffin, the „Cadmould” commercial software was employed, developed mostly for simulation of the powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> of the thermoplastic and composites. Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> sintering, microstructure examination, symulation of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Findings: Simulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> was preceded by the rheological tests, which made obtaining possible of the data indispensable for modelling, pertaining to the polymer-powder slurry viscosity. The portion of particles reinforcing the composite is usually lower than powder portion in mixtures used for forming and next binding agent degradation and sintering. The big powder portion is often the reason for the high viscosity of the mixture and problems with its forming. However, simulation results revealed that the fabricated polymerpowder mixture may be injected, which was confirmed by carrying out powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> on a typical Arburg <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine using in the industry. Practical implications: Application of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> to manufacturing of high speed steel matrix composites gives the possibility to obtain tool materials with the relative high ductility characteristic of steel and high hardness and wear resistance typical for cemented carbides. Originality/value: Application of symulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> conditions using cadmould program gives the possibility to reduce cost of expensive <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> and control the injection conditions...|$|R

This complex and special zipper {{is one of the}} most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy duty. medium and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly. The zipper is commonly installed across the back of the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the torso, which allows self-donning. Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early Poseidon Unisuit), Up one side of the front, around the back of the neck and partway back down the front (later model Poseidon Unisuit) or on a wide tubular chest entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the waist after sealing the zip (some Typhoon suits).

Since plastic is widely used polymer due to its high production rate, low cost and capability to produce intricate parts with high precision.
