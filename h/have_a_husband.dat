5|$|Set in 1957, Great Moments in Aviation follows Gabriel Angel (Rakie Ayola), a young Caribbean {{woman from}} Grenada who embarks {{on a cruise}} to England with the {{intention}} of becoming an aviator. Upon boarding the ship, Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart (Jonathan Pryce). The rest of the ship's passengers, including missionaries Angela Bead (Vanessa Redgrave) and Gwendolyne Quim (Dorothy Tutin) assume the two are married, and when Professor Rex Goodyear (John Hurt) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch, Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover. It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death. She is furious with Duncan for lying to her, but the two go on to reconcile and later make love. Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> waiting for her in England. She explains that he has been there for two years working, and she is joining him so that she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas (Oliver Samuels) who flew off into a storm and never came home. They begin a relationship nonetheless, supported by Angela and Gwendolyne, who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another. They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years, and become lovers, vowing to live together in their retirement. It comes to light that the death of Goodyear's wife was an accident, caused as he and Duncan fought over her. Duncan returns his painting, and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel. She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over, and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together. The film ends with Gabriel's grandmother Vesuvia (Carmen Munroe) reading her family a letter from England, informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together, and are expecting a child. As the family express their delight, Gabriel flies overhead, having finally attained her pilot licence and become an aviator.|$|E
500|$|In the subrahmanya formula, Ahalya {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b> The Sadvimsha Brahmana does not {{explicitly}} state that Ahalya has a husband, although Kaushika (interpreted by most scholars as Ahalya's husband) {{is present in}} the story and his relationship to her can be inferred through Indra's adoption of the Brahmin's form to [...] "visit" [...] Ahalya. Renate Söhnen-Thieme, research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, feels that the Kaushika of the Sadvismha Brahmana is the same individual described as cursing Indra in the 5th- to 4th-century BCE epic Mahabharata (discussed below in [...] "Curse and redemption").|$|E
500|$|Clemencia is the Chicana {{protagonist of}} [...] "Never Marry a Mexican", whose life choices {{can be related}} to those of the {{historical}} figure La Malinche, an indigenous woman who befriended the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century. [...] Both La Malinche and Clemencia were mistresses to men of a different ethnicity than their own, [...] "doomed to exist within a racial and class-cultural wasteland, unanchored by a sense of ever belonging either to [...] ethnic or [...] natal homeland". [...] Clemencia's final revenge in this vignette is not only a triumph in the memory of La Malinche, but also for the women who feel that their value depreciates if they do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband,</b> I have a family, my whole life has changed. It would be pretty strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky. No more Evian bottles!", Madonna told MTV, with the last bit referring to a scene of her performing fellatio on an Evian bottle in Truth or Dare.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the stated}} {{intent of the}} levirate law as {{expressed}} in Deuteronomy is to provide an heir so that the deceased brother's name [...] "will not be obliterated from Israel" [...] (...) , such laws effectively provided protection for widows as well. At the time the Torah was written, if a woman did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> because of widowhood, she {{had no one to}} provide for her any longer and she would be disgraced, if not likely die of starvation. Children were also a means of continued provision, since they are commanded to care and show respect for the elderly as they move further along in years. A childless widow was without both means of provision. Although quite contrary to our modern day dilemmas, even becoming a second wife to a brother-in-law, as indicated in Deuteronomy 25:5-10, was better than living on the streets at the mercy of those around her. Under Torah, men had a responsibility to the women around them, which included life-sustaining provisions (i.e. food, shelter, and comfort). Those of honor were beholden to their responsibility to protect the defenseless.|$|E
2500|$|In the campaign, Chavez {{attacked}} Mikulski, {{a lifelong}} Baltimore resident, as a [...] "San Francisco-style, George McGovern, liberal Democrat". Chavez {{was accused of}} making Mikulski's sexual orientation a central issue of the political campaign. Chavez wrote that the term referred to Jeane Kirkpatrick's 1984 Republican National Convention [...] "Blame America First" [...] speech, in which she coined the phrase [...] "San Francisco Liberal" [...] {{in reference to the}} Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Using political advertisements and press conferences, Chavez attacked Mikulski's former aide Teresa Brennan as [...] "anti-male" [...] and a [...] "radical feminist", implying that Brennan and Mikulski were radical lesbians and that [...] "fascist feminism" [...] was Mikulski's political philosophy. Brennan had not been part of Mikulski's staff for five years, but Chavez implied Brennan was still working on Mikulski's campaign. Mikulski did not respond in kind to the attacks. She defeated Chavez with 61% of the vote. She was the first woman who was elected to the Senate who did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> or father who served in high political office. [...] She also served alongside Paul Sarbanes, the man she'd succeeded in the House.|$|E
