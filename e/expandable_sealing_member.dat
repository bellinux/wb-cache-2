40|$|A pressure-actuated {{shaft seal}} {{assembly}} and associated method for controlling {{the flow of}} fluid adjacent a rotatable shaft are provided. The seal assembly includes one or more <b>seal</b> <b>members</b> that can be adjusted between open and closed positions, for example, according to the rotational speed of the shaft. For example, the <b>seal</b> <b>member</b> can be configured to be adjusted according to a radial pressure differential in a fluid that varies with the rotational speed of the shaft. In addition, in the closed position, each <b>seal</b> <b>member</b> can contact a rotatable member connected to the shaft to form a seal with the rotatable member and prevent fluid from flowing through the assembly. Thus, the seal can be closed at low speeds of operation and opened at high speeds of operation, thereby reducing the heat and wear in the seal assembly while maintaining a sufficient seal during all speeds of operation...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} concerns {{an inflatable}} seal assembly adapted {{for use with}} a bayonet quick-disconnect system particularly useful for the insulated transfer of cryogenic consumables in orbit (such as between a space station and a re-supply vehicle). The zero-leak cryogenic coupling includes a polymeric seal clamped to a male bayonet member with two pairs of tightening rings. The tightening rings threadably engage each other in respective pairs around tapered ends of the inflatable <b>seal</b> <b>member</b> so that a wedging action tightens the <b>seal</b> <b>member</b> about the male bayonet. Once in place, the seal may be inflated via an inflation port so that its expansion provides pressure contact with the inside surface of a coaxial female member...|$|R

40|$|In this project, Stora Enso’s newly {{developed}} building {{system has been}} further developed to allow building to the Swedish passive house standard for the Swedish climate. The building system {{is based on a}} building framework of CLT (Cross laminated timber) boards. The concept has been tested on a small test building. The experience gained from this test building has also been used for planning a larger building (two storeys with the option of a third storey) with passive house standard with this building system. The main conclusions from the project are:  It is possible to build airtight buildings with this technique without using traditional vapour barriers. Initial measurements show that this can be done without reaching critical humidity levels in the walls and roof, at least where wood fibre insulation is used, as this has a greater capacity for storing and evening out the moisture than mineral wool. However, the test building has so far not been exposed to internal generation of moisture (added moisture from showers, food preparation etc.). This needs to be investigated and this will be done during the winter 2013 - 14.  A new fixing method for doors and windows has been tested without traditional fibre filling between them and the CLT panel. The door or window is pressed directly on to the CLT panel instead, with an <b>expandable</b> <b>sealing</b> strip between them. This has been proved to be successful.  The air tightness between the CLT panels is achieved with <b>expandable</b> <b>sealing</b> strips between the panels. The position of the sealing strips is important, both for the air tightness itself and to allow rational assembly.  Recurrent air tightness measurements show that the air tightness decreased somewhat during the first six months, but not {{to such an extent that}} the passive house criteria were not fulfilled. The reason for the decreased air tightness is not clear, but can be due to small movements in the CLT construction and also to the sealing strips being affected by changing outdoor temperatures.  Long term measurements (at least two years) have to be carried out before more reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the long term effect of the construction on air tightness and humidity in the walls.  An economic analysis comparing using a concrete frame or the studied CLT frame for a three storey building shows that it is probably more expensive to build with CLT. For buildings higher than three floors, the CLT frame has economic advantages, mainly because of the shorter building time compared to using concrete for the frame. In this analysis, no considerations have been taken to differences in the influence on the environment or the global climate between the two construction methods...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates numerically the {{phenomenon}} of flutter in Labyrinth seals. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are used to predict the fluid forces produced in the labyrinth {{when one of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>members</b> is vibrating in its natural mode.

50|$|In 1929, Cicero C. Brown {{organized}} Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented {{the first}} liner hanger in 1937. Liner hangers enable drillers to lengthen their casing strings {{without having the}} liner pipe extend {{all the way to}} the surface. This saves capital cost and reduces weight borne by offshore platforms. Hughes Tool Company acquired Brown Oil Tools in 1978. In 1970, Baker Oil Tools acquired Lynes, Inc., which produced liner hangers and other completion equipment. In 1978, Baker Oil Tools introduced the Bakerline casing liner hanger. In 1985, the FlexLock Liner Hanger was introduced, extending the performance range and functionality of liner hanger systems. In 1987, the Brown liner hanger technology was merged into Baker Oil Tools. In 1992, BOT introduced the ZXP Liner Hanger Packer, with <b>expandable</b> metal <b>seals,</b> which set the stage for development of expandable screens, casing systems and liner hangers.|$|R
