40|$|Polyorchidism {{is a rare}} anomaly where early {{segmentation}} in the gonadal ridge {{can lead}} to the development of three or less commonly four testes in one individual. Just over 150 reports of this phenomenon exist in English medical literature. However, once confronted by the clinical finding of supernumerary gonads, one must remain mindful of other likely diagnoses involving nontesticular origin. We report on a male patient with bilaterally impalpable testes in whom splenogonadal fusion mimicked polyorchidism.

40|$|This article contemplates {{whether and}} how court-connected parent {{education}} programs can assist separating parents to access dispute resolution processes that best suit their families’ needs, {{in a manner that}} involves appropriately curtailed levels of state interference with parental autonomy. The author argues that such programs can {{play an important role in}} providing key information to separating parents. Specifically, providing mandatory information to all separating parents who seek access to the family law regime about children’s reactions to parental separation and conflict, and about the desirability of <b>keeping</b> <b>such</b> factors <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> as they consider the various dispute resolution options open to them, is a warranted level of state intervention. However, given current understandings of the appropriate limits on state interference with parental autonomy regarding child-rearing practices, programs aimed specifically at changing parental skills and behaviours should be mandated only on a case-by case basis, where a judge considers such changes necessary...|$|R
30|$|The authors main {{intent was}} to develop a self-report scale {{that could be used to}} measure the self-regulatory {{learning}} levels of university students in Turkey. Turner (1995) points to the relative ease of designing, administering, and scoring self-report questionnaires and adds that they provide (a) information about learners’ memories and interpretations of their actions and (b) their explanations of cognitive and metacognitive processes researchers cannot observe (in Winne and Perry 2000 : 542). <b>Keeping</b> <b>such</b> reviews <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> the authors thought that such a self-report measure would be helpful to researchers and/or teachers dealing with large groups of students. However, as proposed by Boekaerts and Corno (2005), one instrument would not be sufficient enough to fully observe students’ self-regulation in progress. Supporting findings of instruments that measure self-regulation as an aptitude (like self-report questionnaires) with those that measure self-regulation as an event (like think alouds and observations) would definitely provide the researchers or teachers with better pictures of their students’ progress in self-regulation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{iconography}} of two prints owned by Haydn, the traditions to which they belonged and their aesthetic consequences. The prints depict two contrasting audiences, one amused and the other despondent, and feature a range of iconographic references that Haydn would have readily responded to, including such themes as the death of Dido, the world of Tristram Shandy, the madness of Orlando and Don Quixote, the humorous verse of Peter Pindar (one of Haydn’s librettists) and inevitably (in prints of this kind) contemporary English politics. A particular point of interest is a caricature of Edward Topham, an amateur caricaturist and founding editor of the influential newspaper The World, featured {{in one of the}} prints. In a series of issues in the late 1780 s The World published a ‘correspondence’ with Haydn himself, which sought to undermine the composer’s suitability for composing with London audiences’ <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> The print may have helped serve to remind Haydn of this dispute at the time he actually began composing in London and to aid him <b>in</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>such</b> audiences <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when composing for them...|$|R

40|$|Children under 19 {{years of}} age {{constitute}} over 40 % of India′s population and information about their mental health needs is a national imperative. Children with specific learning disorders (SLDs) exhibit academic difficulties disproportionate to their intellectual capacities. Prevalence of SLD ranges from 2 % to 10 %. Dyslexia (developmental reading disorder) {{is the most common}} type, affecting 80 % of all SLD. About 30 % of learning disabled children have behavioral and emotional problems, which range from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (most common) to depression, anxiety, suicide etc., to substance abuse (least common). Co-occurrence of such problems with SLD further adds to the academic difficulty. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> instances, diagnosis is difficult and tricky; improvement in academics demands comprehensive holistic treatment approach. SLD remains a large public health problem because of under-recognition, inadequate treatment and therefore merits greater effort to understand the co-morbidities, especially in the Indian population. As the literature is scarce regarding co-morbid conditions in learning disability in Indian scenario, the present study has tried to focus on Indian population. The educational concessions (recent most) given to such children by Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi are referred to. The issues to be addressed by the family physicians are: Low level of awareness among families and teachers, improper dissemination of accurate information about psychological problems, available help seeking avenues, need to develop service delivery models in rural and urban areas and focus on the integration of mental health and primary care <b>keeping</b> <b>such</b> co-morbidity <b>in</b> <b>mind...</b>|$|R
40|$|Regardless {{efforts by}} the (municipal) public health sector, public health still faces major problems. The {{involvement}} of other policy sectors is generally assumed as necessary. Because, {{in contrast to the}} public health sector, they have policy instruments to address the environmental determinants of health. The idea is that intersectoral policy networks will be established and integrated public health policy (IPHP) will be developed. IPHP is assessed as promising, due to the integration of health considerations into policies of non-public health sectors, i. e., in policy networks across portfolio boundaries. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence on the conditions under which these assumptions about IPHP are true. This study provides insights in the empirical manifestations of IPHP and the conditions under which IPHP leads to an integrated policy output in terms of addressing environmental determinants of health with multiple intervention strategies, policy innovation and perceived public health gain. We concluded that network intersectorality mattered to a certain extent and under specific conditions and that other conditions were also important. Such as the execution of network management strategies, horizontal network integration, a broad policy approach, the involvement of implementing actors in the policy development phase, a project leader from a non-public health sector. There is not one road leading to Rome, but various possibilities and combinations of conditions lead to an integrated policy output. When <b>keeping</b> <b>such</b> nuances <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> possibilities arise for the realization of policy networks across portfolio boundaries in which an integrated policy output can be realized with IPHP...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{dynamics}} of flexible link mechanisms and manipulators is nonlinear, motion and vibration control often relies on linear or piecewise-linear controllers based on linearized models {{in order to ensure}} real-time implementability. <b>Keeping</b> <b>such</b> an objective <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> this paper proposes a general receptance-based method for pole assignment in flexible link mechanisms with a single rigid-body degree of freedom (dof) using a single control force (i. e. rank-one control). A chief advantage of the approach proposed is that it makes use of the second-order system model representation through the receptance matrix of the symmetric part of the asymmetric model. The asymmetric terms in the stiffness and damping matrices arise from the coupling between rigid-body motion and elastic motion. The proposed receptance-based formulation ensures numerical reliability and efficiency also for large dimensional and ill-conditioned system models originating from the simultaneous presence of high-frequency and weakly controllable oscillating modes, and of rigid-body motion low-frequency dynamics, which may also be unstable. The validation of the proposed technique is carried out by performing pole assignment through position and velocity feedback or acceleration and velocity feedback on a mechanism. Integral control is also introduced to improve the steady state system response. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate and robust than two popular established methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{sharp rise in}} {{terrorist}} activities has motivated many researchers to device techniques of identification, analysis, detection, and prediction of {{terrorist activities}} using computing techniques. Terrorists secretly structure themselves in organizations to be more effective. Members in these organizations have to interact and communicate with others in order to plan and carry out haronious acts of terrorism. The pattern of these interactions and communication can reveal the secret structure of these organizations and can also help in predicting their plans of undertaking these activities. The current research proposes to employ techniques {{for the analysis of}} social networks to evaluate their applicability on these secretly formed and structured networks. As it can be viewed from the definition of social network which is "A social network is defined as a social collection made up of social actors like persons or organizations and a compound set of links between these actors". This definition entices us to view terrorist networks as social networks to apply social network analysis to extract their inner structure in form of useful knowledge. The inner structure would reveal the importance of each actor in the network and can then be used for suggesting counter actions that can help in easy destabilization of such organizations preventing them to carry out terrorist incidents. Based on our investigation, we could formulate the fact that traditional social network analysis measures are not directly relevant. This is because of their desires of hiding their intentions and links. <b>Keeping</b> <b>such</b> considerations <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> this thesis proposes a new measure "Relative Degree" for terrorist network analysis. This thesis, builds on to this novel measure and the techniques for the analysis of the network and presents a model to detect active status of the network using outlier detection techniques on the communication/interaction or work patterns of these networks. An active state of a terrorist group or network is defined as the state in which the group is either planning or is already ready for execution on a worked out plan. The other state is passive, where the group is dormant and not executing any activities. The thesis proposes a technique where a percentage of communication is classified as outlier. These cases of outliers contain the active state of the terrorist network if contained. The technique is validated on a privately held record of cyberattacks on an ERP system. To make the novel tool comprehensive for use the thesis further proposes a hybrid classifier for key player detection, This novel classifier has been tested on various publicly available and a privately held dataset. The technique gives an average accuracy of 91. 98...|$|R
40|$|Global {{social and}} {{economic}} changes have not only led to substantial increases in elderly populations but also the manifestation of numerous degenerative and chronic diseases, and new patterns of disease caused by occupational hazards, environmental pollution and accidents. 1, 2 Today, public health concerns related to quality care, cost of medical services and low {{access to health care}} centers have led to a shift in the paradigm of healthcare from the traditional care settings to community centers. 1 With regards to the same points, the health systems in a society must acquire the capabilities required for better meeting the ever-growing demands resulting from these changes. 3 In order to meet these increasing needs and to raise the overall healthcare level of its communities, the Islamic Republic of Iran has envisioned short- and long-term plans {{within the framework of the}} 2025 Horizon Plan in various fields of research, education and provision of healthcare services. 4 In line with this aim, the office of the High Commissioner for medical planning in the country has recently revised the educational curriculum for the Master’s course of community health nursing and has drawn outlines in order to focus the career position of their graduates on a community-oriented approach, <b>in</b> places <b>such</b> as healthcare centers, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, addiction treatment centers, emergency services and natural disaster committees, and in all other organizations needing the services of community health nurses. Moreover, according to the vision drawn out in this plan, in the next ten years (by 2025) the graduates of community health nursing must be able not only to meet the changing needs of Iranian society, but also clearly attain regional and global standards in nursing education and offer effectual service to all members of the society. 5 In addition, in most countries of the world, <b>keeping</b> <b>such</b> curriculum visions <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> curriculum designers facilitate the career position of community health nurses so that they can give care to individuals, families and communities. Furthermore, the number of these nurses working outside the hospital in the community at large has increased substantially, and the community is called their clients. 1 While in Iran, community health nurses after graduating with Master’s degree are in practice faced with an absence of specifically defined job positions even though the curriculum has designated the correct future occupational status. Therefore, Iranian community health nurses are mostly forced into employment in clinical settings or educational centers and do not have the ability like their counterparts in other countries to find a job and start serving at health centers which, as mentioned above, are predetermined before graduation. 6 Now, in view of the above mentioned points, considering the absence of suitable tools for directing these community health nurses to their appropriate occupational and professional positions, this question arises that to what extent the devised long-term objectives (Horizon 2025) of the Islamic Republic can be achieved. It is recommended that the present process of employing community health nurses should be revised so that it facilitates their real occupational and professional positions resulting in providing better services to their clients. ...|$|R
