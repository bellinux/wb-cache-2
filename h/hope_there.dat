For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good <b>Hope.</b> <b>There</b> they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade during a period of calm weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} naming {{convention}} among Telugu Christians {{is the combination}} of the Telugu surname with an English or Biblical first name. Most Telugu Christians have English first names owing to the influence of British and American missionaries. Bilingual names are also common with the first name being an English name and the middle name usually being the Telugu translation of Christian virtues. An example of a Bilingual name is Lily Nirikshana where Lily is a common English name and Nirikshana is the Telugu translation of <b>hope.</b> <b>There</b> are also inter generational differences with respect to naming conventions. Telugu Christian names were more quintessentially British among older generations. The most common masculine first names among older Telugu Christians were George, Edward, Charles etc. The most common feminine first names among older Telugu Christians being Victoria, Daisy, Mary etc. Telugu translations of Christian virtues such as Krupa, Vyduryam, Deevena were also more common among older Telugu Christian women. Current naming trends have shifted towards more Biblical names such as John, Daniel or Rachel etc. However Bilingual names such as Mary Sucharita or Victor Premasagar are still common place among younger generations. Catholic names can also be easily distinguished from Protestant names as Catholic children as usually named after Patron saints. Until recent times, Telugu Christians along with other Telugu people followed the convention of family names preceding first names. This is no longer the norm.|$|E

In addition, there are games, including quizzes, the New Prophecy Adventure, and the Warriors Adventure Game.

It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but has not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game, but if there was, it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series, which is currently not under consideration. Many fans have also created their own forum-based role-playing games.|$|E
500|$|In , hope is {{suppressed}} by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

As a consequence, all clothing manufacturers and retailers in Sweden banned the purchase of wool from sheep that have been mulesed.

[...] In {{a letter to the}} London Times, he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had [...] "not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende." [...] Hayek admitted that [...] "it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is.", he explained, however, [...] "It is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust.
