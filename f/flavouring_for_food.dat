50|$|In the 19th century, Bombay and Madras {{were among}} the {{principal}} distributing ports of cardamom. India's exports to foreign countries increased during the early 20th century, particularly to the United Kingdom, followed by Arabia, Aden, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Persia and Egypt. However, some 95% of cardamom produced in India is for domestic purposes, and India is itself {{by far the most}} important consuming country for cardamoms in the world. India also imports cardamom from Sri Lanka. In 1903 - 4, these imports came to 269,132 lb., valued at Rs. 1,98,710. In contrast, Guatemala's local consumption is negligible, which supports the exportation of most of the cardamom that is produced. In the mid-1800s, Ceylon's cardamom was chiefly imported by Canada. After saffron and vanilla, cardamom is currently the third most expensive spice, and is used as a spice and <b>flavouring</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> and liqueurs and in medicine.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to extract and {{identify}} volatile flavour components from peel, flesh and seeds of feijoa fruit separately and further determine its flavour profile. Obtained information is aimed to be used to develop a new <b>flavour</b> mixture <b>for</b> the <b>food</b> industry. The volatile flavour fraction of feijoa fruit flesh, seeds and skin were isolated by ethanol extraction and steam distillation. Further an organoleptic evaluation was carried out to distinguish flavour differences within the obtained distillates to decrease the number of samples to be analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography analysis resulted in 13 identified flavour compounds of the 23 reference compounds used. Results showed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be most successful and this technique presented a great amount of data of which seven compounds are reported for the first time as flavour compounds of feijoa fruit; citronellyl acetate, cis-rose oxide, geraniol acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, D-limonene and humulane- 1, 6 -dien- 3 -ol. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the extent of unique findings of flavour compounds and to evaluate how they contribute to the flavour of feijoa fruit to be able to produce a <b>flavour</b> mixture <b>for</b> the <b>food</b> industry...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the consumers' and vendors' perceptions about Mondia whitei roots, in Kampala city, Uganda; determined the marketing margins {{and the market}} flow of the roots in the city; documented demand and supply opportunities as well as challenges to marketing of the roots by the vendors. Seventy vendors and 70 consumers of the roots were administered with semi-structured questionnaires. Results showed that M. whytei roots are largely perceived as sexual stimulant, appetiser, <b>flavours</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> and drinks, and stimulant for milk production in lactating mothers. Majority of the vendors (74 %) and consumers (85 %) perceived the trade in the roots as worthwhile. Men and adolescent boys were reported {{to be the main}} consumers. Retailers who buy the roots directly from collectors and later sell to consumers dominate the trade. The average price charged per piece and a kilogram of roots increases from collectors, middlemen and to the retailers. The average retail price was US $ 0. 12 per piece of the root and US $ 1. 50 per kg of the roots. Collectors charged the lowest price (US $ 0. 06 and US $ 0. 60 per piece and a kilogram of the roots respectively) though their profit margins remained the highest (50 %). Several demand and supply opportunities exist for M. whytei roots and these included few sexual stimulant accepted alternatives to M. whytei roots in Kampala city; consumers' willingness to pay high prices when the roots are scarce, and a large number of M. whytei roots gatherers that could promote the cultivation of this plant for the market. Challenges, such as seasonal low supply of the roots, and unorganised market structure, hamper the trade in M. whytei roots. There is a need for experimental research on efficacies of the perceived uses of the roots reported in this study. The possibility of value addition to the roots sold should be investigated...|$|R

5000|$|Merrilactone A [...] {{is one of}} {{the four}} sesquiterpenes that were newly {{discovered}} from the fruit of Illicium merrillianum in 2000. Members of the genus Illicium include Chinese star anise, widely used as a spice <b>for</b> <b>flavouring</b> <b>food</b> and beverages, and also poisonous plants such as Japanese star anise. Chemical studies of Illicium have developed rapidly over the last 20 years, and merrilactone A has been shown to have neurotrophic activity in fetal rat cortical neuron cultures. This has led researchers to believe that Merrilactone A may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.|$|R

30|$|Lipoxygenase catalyzed {{oxidative}} {{coupling reactions}} are utilized extensively in bread making. The addition of lipoxygenase-rich soybean flour {{results in the}} production of fatty acid hydroperoxides, which bleach the pigments of wheat flours. Lipoxygenase action also improves the mixing tolerance and rheological properties of the dough. (Frazier et al. 1973; Faubion and Hoseney 1981; Boussard et al. 2012. Furthermore, lipoxygenases have been used for bleaching dairy products such as cheese, milk, butter oil, cream, and whey (de Roos et al., 2006). Alcohols and aldehydes have been produced industrially from the fatty acid hydroperoxides that are formed in the lipoxygenase-catalyzed reactions. These compounds are used <b>for</b> <b>flavouring</b> <b>foods</b> (Whitehead et al. 1995).|$|R
40|$|Coumarin (2 -oxo- 1, 2 -benzopynpl), a lactone of o-hydroxy-dis-cinnamic acid is a {{naturally}} occurring constituent of certain plants, especially sweet clover. Coumarin, present in "spoilt" clover, is sometimes ingested by livestock causing a haemorrhagic condition. Stahmann et al. (1941) identified dicoumarol as the active principle involved. Due {{to the strong}} structural relationship of dicoumarol with coumarin, Robert and Link (1937) believed that dicoumarol was formed from coumarin. Many of the coumarin derivatives are pharmacologically active and include anticoagulant drugs, rodenticides and insecticides.

5000|$|Cinnamon leaf oil is {{obtained}} by steam distillation of cinnamon leaves {{and the oil}} yield ranges between 0.5% and 1.8%. More than 47 compounds have been identified from the leaf oil, the most significant being eugenol, which constitutes 65-92% [...] Cinnamon leaf oil is cheaper than bark oil and {{is used in the}} flavor industry, to a lesser extent, to flavor confectionary. It is also used as a source of eugenol for the preparation of synthetic vanillin. Cinnamon oleoresin obtained by solvent extraction is a dark brown extremely concentrated and viscous liquid, closely approximating the total spice flavour and containing 50% or more volatile oil. It is used mainly <b>for</b> <b>flavouring</b> <b>food</b> products such as cakes and confectionary. Ground spice has been replaced by oils and oleoresin in food industry.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the associations between taste sensitivity, preference for sweet and salty flavours, and nutritional status of adolescents in public schools. Methods We used a cross-sectional study involving 1, 036 adolescents of both sexes, aged 10 - 19 years. Preference for sweet or salty <b>flavours</b> and preference <b>for</b> <b>foods</b> high in sugar or sodium were evaluated. Measurements of body mass index and taste flavour intensity recognition were conducted. Results Most participants were unable to identify the flavours and/or intensities, and only 18. 0 % of participants were able to correctly identify both the flavour and intensity of the samples. Most participants (82. 1 %) preferring sweet foods had low sensitivity to this taste, just as {{a large proportion of}} individuals preferring saltiness (82. 3 %) were less sensitive to salt (p< 0. 001). Preference for saltiness was associated with pre-obesity. Conclusion We found an association between a preference for sweet or salty flavours and nutritional status, highlighting the importance of poor food choices in the development of obesity and other chronic diseases...|$|R

The increasing interest in optical imaging techniques and the development of related technologies have made possible the investigation of the optical properties of several compounds. Luminescent properties of essential oils have not been extensively investigated. We evaluated the luminescent and fluorescent emissions of several essential oils, in order to detect them in living organisms by exploiting their optical properties. Some fluorescent emission data were high enough to be detected in dermal treatments. Consequently, we demonstrated how the fluorescent signal can be monitored for at least three hours on the skin of living mice treated with wild chamomile oil. The results encourage development of this technique to investigate the properties of drugs and cosmetics containing essential oils...|$|R
