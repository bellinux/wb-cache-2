40|$|Abstract: For {{the rapid}} {{erection}} of FRP truss bridge, {{based on the}} FRP material characteristics, it was put forward to a suitable FRP truss bridge construction hoisting technology. Hoisting technology was divided into two types: integral hoisting and segment hoisting. This article mainly researched and analyzed the aspect of the selection of hoisting scheme, the selection of hoisting equipment and <b>hoisting</b> <b>point,</b> expounded emphatically the selection principle and method of hanging point when hoisting, and checked <b>hoisting</b> <b>point</b> in different cases. Certain references were provided for the subsequent FRP truss bridge hoisting erection. ...|$|E
50|$|As a {{shipboard}} aircraft the Villier IV {{was required}} to have, {{in addition to the}} normal equipment of a two-seat military machine, folding wings and tow and <b>hoist</b> <b>points.</b> It also had to be well provided with navigation, radio and visual signalling equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>hoists,</b> {{also known}} as spot line winches, control a single lift line and are {{commonly}} used for automated spot rigging or flying rigs. A <b>point</b> <b>hoist</b> may operate in solitude, or in unison with other <b>point</b> <b>hoists</b> to comprise a line set.|$|R
50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>hoists</b> using {{wire rope}} (GAC) are common, and steel band <b>point</b> <b>hoists</b> are also used. While {{generally}} {{more expensive than}} chain hoists, wire rope and steel band <b>point</b> <b>hoists</b> can operate at relatively high speeds. Wire rope spot line winches may be configured to pay {{out to the side}} (horizontally), for use in conjunction with a loft block, so that the position of the relatively heavy winch can be static and only the loft block need be spotted above the pick point.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a single}} bay sesquiplane. Like most Villiers aircraft, the wingplans were {{strictly}} rectangular in plan apart from a shallow cut-out over the forward cockpit; the upper wings had three times {{the area of the}} lower. They were built around spruce box spars, fabric covered and braced together by an outward and forward leaning interplane strut on each side. The lower wings were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and braced to the upper longerons with single struts leaning inwards at about 45°. The upper wing was held over the fuselage by a fore and aft pair of W-form struts, one to each of its two spars. Wing folding was achieved with hinges on the rear longerons, immediately outside of the centre section to fuselage struts. There were full span ailerons, fitted only on the upper wing. A pair of upper wing <b>hoisting</b> <b>points</b> enabled the Villier IV to be lifted back on board its ship by a crane.|$|R
50|$|With a flag {{width of}} 180 units, {{the width of}} the triangle, from <b>hoist</b> to <b>point,</b> should be 84 units. The height of the flag will thus be 95 units, with the yellow band being 5 units tall, the gold fimbriations are each 6 units tall and the upper and lower (red and green) parts of the field are, thus, 39 units tall each.|$|R
5000|$|Chain hoists, more {{commonly}} referred to as chain motors, are {{the most common form of}} <b>point</b> <b>hoist,</b> especially with touring musical shows (e.g., rock-and-roll shows), but are relatively slow. Chain motors can be mounted at the grid to hoist a load from above, or mounted at the load to [...] "climb" [...] towards the grid.|$|R
50|$|On large rigs, staysails {{other than}} {{headsails}} are named {{according to the}} mast and mast section on which they are hoisted. Thus, the staysail hoisted on a stay that runs forward and downwards {{from the top of}} the mizzen topgallant mast is the mizzen topgallant staysail. If two staysails are <b>hoisted</b> to different <b>points</b> on this mast, they would be the mizzen upper topgallant staysail and the mizzen lower topgallant staysail.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{solve the}} quick and {{accurate}} level-adjusting {{problem in the}} process of spacecraft precise mating, automatic leveling and equalizing hoist device for spacecraft is developed. Based on lifting point adjustment by utilizing XY-workbench, the leveling and equalizing controller by a self-adaptive control algorithm is proposed. By simulation analysis and lifting test using engineering prototype, validity and reliability of the hoist device is verified, which can meet the precision mating requirements of practical applications for spacecraft. Keywords—automatic leveling and equalizing, <b>hoist</b> device, lifting <b>point</b> adjustment, self-adaptive control H I...|$|R
50|$|Flying rigs {{are used}} to fly scenery or {{performers}} in a more elaborate fashion than typical line sets. A flying rig typically allows horizontal as well as vertical movement by paying out individual lift lines to varying lengths and/or {{through the use of}} tracks. Flying rigs usually involve specialized equipment and techniques operated by a relatively experienced crew. Peter Foy is known for his innovations in manual flying rigs, especially those used in theatrical productions of Peter Pan. Automated flying rigs, which synchronize multiple <b>point</b> <b>hoists,</b> are becoming more common as motor control systems become safer and more sophisticated.|$|R

In Four-column limb lattice jib {{structure}} {{system as}} the research object, considering {{the structure and}} mechanical characteristics, combining with the allowable stress method, from the failure mode of static strength, stiffness, overall stability and local stability to build lattice jib structure system reliability failure criterion. Based {{on the influence of}} parameter perturbation calculation of four-column limb lattice jib structure system, get the length of the jib, lifting weight, jib elevation, <b>hoisting</b> load bearing <b>point</b> offset, the proportion of wind environment on the influence of different failure modes and failure change law, as the main failure mode of the decision to provide the basis and methods...|$|R
5000|$|On December 24, 2007, Thomas {{was signed}} to a ten-day {{contract}} with the New Jersey Nets. He played in four games with the Nets, scoring a total of two points. On February 22, 2008, Thomas was signed to a ten-day contract by the Cleveland Cavaliers so they would have enough players to face the Washington Wizards that night, due to a depleted roster because of a blockbuster trade the day prior. [...] Thomas saw his first action as a Cavalier that very night, playing 19 minutes and scoring 9 points on three three-point shots. Thomas <b>hoisted</b> 11 three <b>point</b> field goals attempts, his career high.|$|R
40|$|We generalize Knoop et al. ’s Lazy Code Motion (LCM) {{algorithm}} for partial redundancy elimination so {{that the}} generalized version also performs strength reduction. Although Knoop et al. have themselves extended LCM to strength reduction with their Lazy Strength Reduction algorithm, our approach differs substantially from theirs and results in a broader class of candidate expressions, stronger safety guarantees, {{and the elimination of}} the potential for performance loss instead of gain. Also, our general framework is not limited to traditional strength reduction, but rather can also handle a wide variety of optimizations in which data-flow information enables the replacement of a computation with a less expensive one. As a simple example, computations can be <b>hoisted</b> to <b>points</b> where they are constant foldable. Another example we sketch is the hoisting of polymorphic operations to points where type analysis provides leverage for optimization. Our general approach consists of placing computations so as to minimize their cost, rather than merely their number. So long as the cost differences between flowgraph nodes obey a certain natural constraint, a cost-optimal code motion transformation that does not unnecessarily prolong the lifetime of temporary variables can be found using techniques completely analogous to LCM. Specifically, the cost differences can be discovered using a wide variety of forward data-flow analyses in a manner which we describe...|$|R
