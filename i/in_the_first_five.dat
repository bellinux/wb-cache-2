5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E

5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|After {{qualifying}} {{fifth in}} Bahrain, Webber {{had been as}} high as third place in the race but he ultimately finished sixth, taking his points tally to 7 for the season.

5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 Johnson {{received}} $1.1 {{million in}} grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. Johnson used the money to create eight smaller learning communities for the 2003–2004 school year. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years the graduation rate at Johnson increased 19% with state-required 10th grade reading and writing tests also seeing double digit increases.

5|$|In 2008–09, F.C. United {{made their}} {{debut in the}} FA Trophy, {{reaching}} the third qualifying round, and missed out on a play-off place {{on the last day}} of the regular season.

5|$|In the 2009 Sprint Cup season Hornish {{returned}} to Penske, {{now known as}} Penske Championship Racing. For the second straight year, his team changed owners' points (purchasing them from Dave Blaney and Bill Davis Racing this time) to guarantee him a starting spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> races. At the season-opening Daytona 500, Hornish started 29th and finished 32nd (one lap behind).

Hornish's victory in the Sprint Showdown at Lowe's Motor Speedway qualified him for the 2009 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, where he started 19th and finished 16th. Later that season, he had two top-five finishes: a career-best fourth at Pocono and a fifth at Michigan. Hornish finished 28th in the final standings, with 3,203 points.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing {{the autonomy of the}} country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

Since 1989, barring an interregnum of five years between 1991 and 1996, the seat has been held by Ko. Si. Mani of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.
