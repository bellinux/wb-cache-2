40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>Gal</b> 80 protein has two binding partners: <b>Gal</b> 4 and <b>Gal</b> 3. In {{the absence}} of galactose, <b>Gal</b> 80 binds to and {{inhibits}} the transcriptional activation domain (AD) of the <b>GAL</b> gene activator, <b>Gal</b> 4, preventing <b>GAL</b> gene expression. Galactose triggers an association between <b>Gal</b> 3 and <b>Gal</b> 80, relieving <b>Gal</b> 80 inhibition of <b>Gal</b> 4. We selected for <b>GAL</b> 80 mutants with impaired capacity of <b>Gal</b> 80 to bind to <b>Gal</b> 3 or <b>Gal</b> 4 AD. Most <b>Gal</b> 80 variants selected for impaired binding to <b>Gal</b> 4 AD retained their capacity to bind to <b>Gal</b> 3 and to self-associate, whereas most of those selected for impaired binding to <b>Gal</b> 3 lost their ability to bind to <b>Gal</b> 4 AD and self-associate. Thus, some <b>Gal</b> 80 amino acids are determinants for both the <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 3 association and the <b>Gal</b> 80 self-association, and <b>Gal</b> 80 self-association may be required for binding to <b>Gal</b> 4 AD.

40|$|<b>Gal</b> 4 is a prototypical {{eukaryotic}} transcriptional activator whose recruitment {{function is}} inhibited {{in the absence}} of galactose by the <b>Gal</b> 80 protein through masking of its transcriptional activation domain (AD). A long-standing nondissociation model posits that galactose-activated <b>Gal</b> 3 interacts with <b>Gal</b> 4 -bound <b>Gal</b> 80 at the promoter, yielding a tripartite <b>Gal</b> 3 -Gal 80 -Gal 4 complex with altered <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 4 conformation to enable <b>Gal</b> 4 AD activity. Some recent data challenge this model, whereas other recent data support the model. To address this controversy, we imaged fluorescent-protein-tagged <b>Gal</b> 80, <b>Gal</b> 4, and <b>Gal</b> 3 in live cells containing a novel <b>GAL</b> gene array. We find that <b>Gal</b> 80 rapidly dissociates from <b>Gal</b> 4 in response to galactose. Importantly, this dissociation is <b>Gal</b> 3 dependent and concurrent with <b>Gal</b> 4 -activated <b>GAL</b> gene expression. When galactose-triggered dissociation is followed by galactose depletion, preexisting <b>Gal</b> 80 reassociates with <b>Gal</b> 4, indicating that sequestration of <b>Gal</b> 80 by <b>Gal</b> 3 contributes to the observed <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 4 dissociation. Moreover, the ratio of nuclear <b>Gal</b> 80 to cytoplasmic <b>Gal</b> 80 decreases in response to <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 3 interaction. Taken together, these and other results provide strong support for a <b>GAL</b> gene switch model wherein <b>Gal</b> 80 rapidly dissociates from <b>Gal</b> 4 through a mechanism that involves sequestration of <b>Gal</b> 80 by galactose-activated <b>Gal</b> 3...|$|R

To identify the binding determinants for <b>Gal</b> 3 's interaction with <b>Gal</b> 80 we carried out <b>GAL</b> 3 –GAL 80 intergenic suppression analyses and selected for new <b>GAL</b> 3 mutations that impair the <b>Gal</b> 3 –Gal 80 interaction.

25|$|The {{following}} season Hayes installed an I-formation {{attack with}} Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated {{with a powerful}} offense and equally impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more <b>galling</b> for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Awards, but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition.|$|E
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL/MEL regulon {{genes are}} {{normally}} induced {{within minutes of}} galactose addition, but <b>gal</b> 3 mutants exhibit a 3 - 5 -day induction lag. We have discovered that this long-term adaptation (LTA) phenotype conferred by <b>gal</b> 3 is complemented by multiple copies of the <b>GAL</b> 1 gene. Based on this result and the striking similarity between the <b>GAL</b> 3 and <b>GAL</b> 1 protein sequences we attempted to detect galactokinase activity that might {{be associated with the}} <b>GAL</b> 3 protein. By both in vivo and in vitro tests the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product does not appear to catalyze a galactokinase-like reaction. In complementary experiments, Escherichia coli galactokinase expressed in yeast was shown to complement the <b>gal</b> 1 but not the <b>gal</b> 3 mutation. Thus, the complementation activity provided by <b>GAL</b> 1 is not likely due to galactokinase activity, but rather due to a distinct <b>GAL</b> 3 -like activity. Overall, the results indicate that <b>GAL</b> 1 encodes a bifunctional protein. In related experiments we tested for function of the LTA induction pathway in <b>gal</b> 3 cells deficient for other gene functions. It has been known for some time that <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 1, <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 7, <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 10, and <b>gal</b> 3 rho [...] are incapable of induction. We constructed isogenic haploid strains bearing the <b>gal</b> 3 mutation in combination with either <b>gal</b> 15 or pgi 1 mutations: the <b>gal</b> 15 and pgi 1 blocks are not specific for the galactose pathway in contrast to the <b>gal</b> 1, <b>gal</b> 7 and <b>gal</b> 10 blocks. The <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 5 and <b>gal</b> 3 pgi 1 double mutants were not inducible, whereas both the <b>gal</b> 5 and pgi 1 single mutants were inducible.

40|$|<b>Gal</b> 4 -mediated {{activation}} of <b>GAL</b> gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires {{the interaction of}} <b>Gal</b> 3 with <b>Gal</b> 80, the <b>Gal</b> 4 inhibitor protein. While {{it is known that}} galactose and ATP activates <b>Gal</b> 3 interaction with <b>Gal</b> 80, neither the mechanism of activation nor the surface that binds to <b>Gal</b> 80 is known. We addressed this through intragenic suppression of <b>GAL</b> 3 C alleles that cause galactose-independent <b>Gal</b> 3 –Gal 80 interaction. We created a new allele, <b>GAL</b> 3 SOC, and showed that it suppressed a new <b>GAL</b> 3 C allele. We tested the effect of <b>GAL</b> 3 SOC on several newly isolated and existing <b>GAL</b> 3 C alleles that map throughout the gene. All except one <b>GAL</b> 3 C allele, D 368 V, were suppressible by <b>GAL</b> 3 SOC. <b>GAL</b> 3 SOC and all <b>GAL</b> 3 C alleles were localized on a <b>Gal</b> 3 homology model that is based on the structure of the highly related <b>Gal</b> 1 protein. These results provide evidence for allosterism in the galactose- and ATP-{{activation of}} <b>Gal</b> 3 binding to <b>Gal</b> 80. In addition, because D 368 V and residues corresponding to <b>Gal</b> 80 -nonbinder mutations colocalized to a domain that is absent in homologous proteins that do not bind to <b>Gal</b> 80, we suggest that D 368 {{is a part of the}} <b>Gal</b> 80 -binding surface...|$|R
40|$|The <b>GAL</b> 4 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a DNA-binding {{transcriptional}} activator that {{is highly}} specific for the <b>GAL</b> genes. In vivo levels of <b>GAL</b> gene transcription are closely correlated with the phosphorylation state of <b>GAL</b> 4. In vivo levels of <b>GAL</b> gene transcription are also affected by {{the activity of the}} <b>GAL</b> 11 (SPT 13) protein, a protein that has been implicated as a global auxiliary transcriptional factor. Here we examine the influence of <b>GAL</b> 11 (SPT 13) on the phosphorylation state of <b>GAL</b> 4. Cells bearing a <b>gal</b> 11 deletion mutation are defective in the production or maintenance of <b>GAL</b> 4 III, a phosphorylated form of <b>GAL</b> 4 that is associated with higher levels of <b>GAL</b> gene transcription. In addition, the <b>gal</b> 11 deletion cells are reduced in total <b>GAL</b> 4 protein. However, the fivefold-reduced expression of the <b>GAL</b> 1 gene observed in <b>gal</b> 11 deletion cells cannot be due solely to reduced levels of total <b>GAL</b> 4 protein, since <b>gal</b> 11 deletion cells amplified for <b>GAL</b> 4 production are still markedly reduced in <b>GAL</b> 4 protein-dependent transcription.

25|$|This was all {{the more}} <b>galling</b> given that, under the Spaniards and Austrians, the city's {{inhabitants}} received no compensation for all this: they were to provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was only fair for citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien Régime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who had been involved in disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not keeping all rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Gal</b> 3, <b>Gal</b> 80, and <b>Gal</b> 4 {{proteins}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{comprise a}} signal transducer that governs the galactose-inducible <b>Gal</b> 4 p-mediated transcription activation of <b>GAL</b> regulon genes. In {{the absence of}} galactose, <b>Gal</b> 80 p binds to <b>Gal</b> 4 p and prohibits <b>Gal</b> 4 p from activating transcription, whereas {{in the presence of}} galactose, <b>Gal</b> 3 p binds to <b>Gal</b> 80 p and relieves its inhibition of <b>Gal</b> 4 p. We have found that immunoprecipitation of full-length <b>Gal</b> 4 p from yeast extracts coprecipitates less <b>Gal</b> 80 p in the presence than in the absence of <b>Gal</b> 3 p, galactose, and ATP. We have also found that retention of <b>Gal</b> 80 p by GSTG 4 AD (amino acids [aa] 768 to 881) is markedly reduced in the presence compared to the absence of <b>Gal</b> 3 p, galactose, and ATP. Consistent with these in vitro results, an in vivo two-hybrid genetic interaction between <b>Gal</b> 80 p and <b>Gal</b> 4 p (aa 768 to 881) was shown to be weaker in the presence than in the absence of <b>Gal</b> 3 p and galactose. These compiled results indicate that the binding of <b>Gal</b> 3 p to <b>Gal</b> 80 p results in destabilization of a <b>Gal</b> 80 p-Gal 4 p complex.

40|$|Galactose-inducible genes (<b>GAL</b> genes) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are {{efficiently}} transcribed {{only when}} the sequence-specific transcription activator <b>Gal</b> 4 p is activated.

Here, we present evidence that the <b>Gal</b> 3 p–Gal 80 p interaction occurs in the cytoplasm, and concurrently, <b>Gal</b> 80 p is removed from <b>Gal</b> 4 p at the <b>GAL</b> gene promoter. We also show that <b>GAL</b> gene expression can be activated by heterologous protein–protein interaction in the cytoplasm that is independent of galactose and <b>Gal</b> 3 p function.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} activation {{function of the}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>GAL</b> 4 protein is modulated by the <b>GAL</b> 80 and <b>GAL</b> 3 proteins. In the absence of galactose, <b>GAL</b> 80 inhibits the function of <b>GAL</b> 4, presumably by direct binding to the <b>GAL</b> 4 protein. The presence of galactose triggers the relief of the <b>GAL</b> 80 block. The key to this relief is the <b>GAL</b> 3 protein. How <b>GAL</b> 3 and galactose activate <b>GAL</b> 4 is not understood, but the long-standing notion has been that a galactose derivative formed by catalytic activity of <b>GAL</b> 3 is the inducer that interacts with <b>GAL</b> 80 or the <b>GAL</b> 80 -GAL 4 complex. Here we report that overproduction of the <b>GAL</b> 3 protein causes constitutive expression of GAL/MEL genes {{in the absence of}} exogenous galactose. Overproduction of the <b>GAL</b> 1 protein (galactokinase) also causes constitutivity, consistent with the observations that <b>GAL</b> 1 is strikingly similar in amino acid sequence to <b>GAL</b> 3 and has <b>GAL</b> 3 -like induction activity. Cells lacking the <b>GAL</b> 10 -encoded UDP-galactose-UDP-glucose epimerase retained the constitutivity response to overproduction of <b>GAL</b> 3, making it unlikely that constitutivity is due to endogenously produced galactose. A galactose-independent mechanism of constitutivity is further indicated by the inducing properties of two newly created galactokinaseless alleles of <b>GAL</b> 1. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model for galactose-induced activation of the <b>GAL</b> 4 protein. This model invokes galactose-activation of the <b>GAL</b> 3 and <b>GAL</b> 1 proteins which in turn elicit an alteration of the <b>GAL</b> 80 -GAL 4 complex to activate <b>GAL</b> 4.

Since <b>GAL</b> 7 is positioned downstream of <b>GAL</b> 10 and both genes are expressed co-ordinately at high levels, the possibility that <b>GAL</b> 10 transcription influences <b>GAL</b> 7 was analysed. Using transcriptional run-on assays, we show that high levels of polymerase are found in the 600 bp <b>GAL</b> 10 - 7 intergenic region that accumulate over the <b>GAL</b> 7 promoter. Furthermore, <b>GAL</b> 7 transcription is enhanced when the <b>GAL</b> 10 upstream activating sequence (UASG) is deleted, indicating that interference between <b>GAL</b> 10 and <b>GAL</b> 7 is likely to occur in the chromosomal locus.

40|$|Regulation of the <b>GAL</b> {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{determined}} by the interplay of the transcriptional activator <b>Gal</b> 4 p and the repressor <b>Gal</b> 80 p, which binds and masks the activation domain of <b>Gal</b> 4 p under non-inducing conditions.

In addition, <b>Gal</b> 80 dimers transiently interact with each other to form higher order multimers.

In contrast, <b>GAL</b> genes under the control of a single <b>Gal</b> 4 p binding site do not stabilize <b>Gal</b> 80 p multimers, resulting in significant and biologically important transcriptional leakage.

To distinguish which forms of <b>GAL</b> 4 (<b>GAL</b> 4 I, <b>GAL</b> 4 II, or both) might be responsible for transcription activation in the absence of <b>GAL</b> 4 III, we performed immunoblot analysis on UASgal-binding-competent <b>GAL</b> 4 proteins from four <b>gal</b> 4 missense mutants selected for their inability to activate transcription (M. Johnston and J. Dover, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 : 2401 - 2405, 1987; Genetics 120; 63 - 74, 1988). The three mutants with no detectable <b>GAL</b> 1 expression did not appear to form <b>GAL</b> 4 II or <b>GAL</b> 4 III, but revertants in which <b>GAL</b> 4 -dependent transcription was restored did display <b>GAL</b> 4 II- or <b>GAL</b> 4 III-like electrophoretic species. Detection of <b>GAL</b> 4 II in a UASgal-binding mutant suggests that neither UASgal binding nor GAL/MEL gene activation is required for the formation of <b>GAL</b> 4 II. Overall, our results imply that <b>GAL</b> 4 I may be inactive in transcriptional activation, whereas <b>GAL</b> 4 II appears to be active. In light of this work, we hypothesize that phosphorylation of <b>GAL</b> 4 I makes it competent to activate transcription...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{dominant}} mutations showing greatly enhanced {{resistance to}} the glucose repression of galactokinase synthesis have been isolated from <b>GAL</b> 81 mutants, which have the constitutive phenotype but are still strongly repressible by glucose for the synthesis of the Leloir enzymes. These glucose-resistant mutants were due to semidominant mutations at either of two loci, <b>GAL</b> 82 and <b>GAL</b> 83. Both loci are unlinked to the <b>GAL</b> 81 - <b>gal</b> 4, <b>gal</b> 80, or <b>gal</b> 7 X <b>gal</b> 10 X <b>gal</b> 1 locus or to each other. The <b>GAL</b> 83 locus was mapped on chromosome V at a site between arg 9 and cho 1. The <b>GAL</b> 82 and <b>GAL</b> 83 mutations produced partial resistance of galactokinase to glucose repression only when {{one or both of}} these mutations were combined with a <b>GAL</b> 81 or a <b>gal</b> 80 mutation. The <b>GAL</b> 82 and <b>GAL</b> 83 mutations are probably specific for expression of the Leloir pathway and related enzymes, because they do not affect the synthesis of alpha-D-glucosidase, invertase, or isocitrate lyase...|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces, the enzymes used {{to convert}} {{galactose}} to glucose are specified by three coordinately expressed, tightly linked genes, <b>GAL</b> 7, <b>GAL</b> 10, and <b>GAL</b> 1. These genes are induced by galactose and {{are controlled by}} the positive regulator gene <b>gal</b> 4 and the negative regulator gene <b>gal</b> 80. <b>GAL</b> 81 mutations, which are known to alter the <b>gal</b> 4 protein, produce a constitutive phenotype. We have cloned fragments of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis DNA that span 26. 3 kilobases surrounding the three clustered <b>GAL</b> genes. About 5 kilobases of the sequence was determined, which includes the entire <b>GAL</b> 1 gene, the two intercistronic regions, and portions of the coding sequences of <b>GAL</b> 10 and <b>GAL</b> 7. Some amino acid homology between the <b>GAL</b> 1 gene product, galactokinase, and the Escherichia coli galactokinase was detected. By using various Saccharomyces DNA fragments, the accumulation of <b>GAL</b> 1 and <b>GAL</b> 10 RNA in yeast cells after induction with galactose was studied. Our results, using wild-type, <b>gal</b> 4 -, <b>gal</b> 80 -, and <b>GAL</b> 81 - 1 - yeast cells, {{support the hypothesis that}} control is exerted at the transcriptional level...|$|R
500|$|During {{the voyage}} Morrell {{experienced}} several {{encounters with the}} slave trade, first at the Cape Verde Islands, then a centre for the trade because of its geographical position {{in relation to the}} Americas, Europe and Africa. He found the slaves' conditions wretched, but was impressed by their passion for music which, he thought, [...] "can alleviate even the pangs caused by the <b>galling</b> fetters of slavery". Later in the voyage he witnessed what he describes as [...] "horrid barbarity", including the spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings. A lengthy soliloquy in his journal on the evils of slavery concludes: [...] "he root, the source, the foundation of the evil is the ignorance and superstition of the poor negroes themselves". On June 8, 1829, Morrell wrote in his journal: [...] "The voyage had been prosperous beyond our expectations, and any further stay on the African coast would have been {{a waste of time and}} money". [...] He arrived in New York on July 14.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning of}} July 3 {{revealed}} the full {{scale of the}} Union defenses, as enemy artillery opened fire {{at a distance of}} 500 yards with a [...] "terrific and <b>galling</b> fire", followed by a ferocious assault on Steuart's position. The result was a [...] "terrible slaughter" [...] of the Third Brigade, which fought for many hours without relief, exhausting their ammunition, but successfully holding their position. Then, late on the morning of July 3, Johnson ordered a bayonet charge against the well-fortified enemy lines, [...] "confident of their ability to sweep him away and take the whole Union line in reverse". Steuart was appalled, and was strongly critical of the attack, but direct orders could not be disobeyed, and Steuart gave the order to [...] "Left face" [...] and [...] "file right", sending his men into heavy enfilading fire. Steuart's Third Brigade advanced against the Union breastworks and attempted several times to wrest control of Culp's Hill, {{a vital part of the}} Union Army defensive line. The result was a [...] "slaughterpen", as the Second Maryland and the Third North Carolina regiments courageously charged a well-defended position strongly held by three brigades, a few reaching within twenty paces of the enemy lines. So severe were the casualties among his men that Steuart is said to have broken down and wept, wringing his hands and crying [...] "my poor boys". Overall, the failed attack on Culp's Hill cost Johnson's division almost 2,000 men, of which 700 were accounted for by Steuart's brigade alone—far more than any other brigade in the division. At Hagerstown, on the 8th July, out of a pre-battle strength of 2,200, just 1,200 men reported for duty. The casualty rate among the Second Maryland and Third North Carolina was between one half and two-thirds, in the space of just ten hours.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{function}} of the <b>GAL</b> 11 gene is required for maximum production of the enzymes encoded by <b>GAL</b> 1, <b>GAL</b> 7, and <b>GAL</b> 10 (collectively termed <b>GAL</b> 1, 7, 10) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains bearing a <b>gal</b> 11 mutation synthesize these enzymes at 10 to 30 % of the wild-type level in the induced state. In a DNA-RNA hybridization experiment, the <b>gal</b> 11 effect was shown to be exerted at the transcription level. Yeast cells bearing the <b>gal</b> 11 mutation were shown to grow on glycerol plus lactate more slowly than the wild type. We isolated recombinant plasmids carrying the <b>GAL</b> 11 gene by complementation of the <b>gal</b> 11 mutation. When the <b>GAL</b> 11 locus was disrupted by insertion of the URA 3 gene, the resulting yeast cells (<b>gal</b> 11 ::URA 3) exhibited phenotypes almost identical {{to those of the}} <b>gal</b> 11 strains, with respect to both galactose utilization and growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Deficiency of <b>Gal</b> 4, the major transcription activator for <b>GAL</b> 1, 7, 10, was epistatic over the <b>gal</b> 11 defect. The <b>Gal</b> 11 deficiency lowered the expression of <b>GAL</b> 2 but not that of MEL 1 or <b>GAL</b> 80; expression of these genes is also known to be dependent on <b>GAL</b> 4 function. We determined the nucleotide sequence of <b>GAL</b> 11, which is predicted to encode a 107 -kilodalton protein with stretches of polyglutamine and poly(glutamine-alanine). An alpha-helix-beta-turn-alpha-helix structure was found in a distal part of the predicted amino acid sequence. A possible role of the <b>GAL</b> 11 product in the regulation of galactose-inducible genes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Genetics and {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} the direct {{interaction}} between <b>Gal</b> 3 p and <b>Gal</b> 80 p plays a central role in galactose-dependent <b>Gal</b> 4 p-mediated <b>GAL</b> gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Precisely how <b>Gal</b> 3 p-Gal 80 p interaction effects induction is not clear. It has been assumed that <b>Gal</b> 3 p interacts with <b>Gal</b> 80 p in the nucleus upon galactose addition to release <b>Gal</b> 80 p inhibition of <b>Gal</b> 4 p. Although <b>Gal</b> 80 p has been shown to possess nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, the subcellular distribution of neither <b>Gal</b> 80 p nor <b>Gal</b> 3 p was previously determined. Here we report that <b>Gal</b> 3 p is located in the cytoplasm and apparently excluded from the nucleus. We show that <b>Gal</b> 80 p is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Converting <b>Gal</b> 80 p into a nucleus-localized protein (NLS-Gal 80 p) by exogenous NLS addition impairs <b>GAL</b> gene induction. The impaired induction can be partially suppressed by targeting <b>Gal</b> 3 p to the nucleus (NLS-Gal 3 p). We document a very rapid association between NLS-Gal 3 p and <b>Gal</b> 80 p in vivo in response to galactose, illustrating that the nuclear import of <b>Gal</b> 80 p is very rapid and efficient. We also demonstrate that nucleus-localized NLS-Gal 80 p can move out of the nucleus and shuttle between nuclei in yeast heterokaryons. These results are the first indication that the subcellular distribution dynamics of the <b>Gal</b> 3 and <b>Gal</b> 80 proteins play a role in regulating <b>Gal</b> 4 p-mediated <b>GAL</b> gene expression in vivo...|$|R
40|$|During the {{galactose}} {{adaptation period}} of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain bearing a naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3 allele, we found a longer induction lag and slower rate of accumulation of <b>GAL</b> 10 and MEL 1 RNAs compared to wild-type strains. A strain of genotype <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 1 <b>gal</b> 7 is noninducible for MEL 1 gene expression, but this expression block is bypassed by overexpression of the <b>GAL</b> 4 gene or by deletion of the <b>GAL</b> 80 gene, either of which causes a constitutive phenotype. An otherwise wild-type strain that bears a chromosomal <b>gal</b> 3 gene disruption mutation does not produce wild-type <b>GAL</b> 3 RNA and exhibits induction comparable to a strain bearing the naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3. Based on this array of results, we conclude that the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product executes its function at a point before <b>GAL</b> 4 mediated transcription of the <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 and MEL 1 genes. Thus, the data {{are consistent with the}} previously advanced hypothesis that the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product functions to synthesize the inducer or coinducer molecule. In experiments in which the presence of either the plasmid-carried cloned <b>GAL</b> 3 gene or the plasmid-carried cloned <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 genes allows MEL 1 induction of a <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 1 <b>gal</b> 7 cell, we find that loss of the plasmid results in the shutoff of MEL 1 expression even when galactose is continuously present. Either <b>GAL</b> 3 function or <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 functions are therefore required for both the initiation and the maintenance of the induced state. Since the strains bearing either the naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3 allele or the <b>gal</b> 3 disruption (null) allele do induce, the plasmid loss experiments indicate the existence of two completely independent induction initiation-maintenance pathways, one requiring <b>GAL</b> 3 function, the other requiring <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 function. Finally, Northern blot analysis reveals two major <b>GAL</b> 3 transcripts that differ in size by approximately 500 nucleotides...|$|R
