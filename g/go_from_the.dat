The 33rd game, Midnight in Salem, will be voiced by a new actress. Minella, who has voiced Nancy for 17 years, was let <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> role. Her Interactive said that the community has been nothing but supportive of Minella, and that their overall goal is to keep creating noteworthy games.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E

5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{then became}} involved with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) and the two were later married; their union ended after a year due to Tucker's adultery. In 2011, {{it was revealed that}} Tucker was the previously unknown father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), which also revealed a long ago affair with Yolanda Hamilton (Debbi Morgan); a plot that was met with positive reviews. While several television critics were surprised by the decision to replace Russ with Nichols, the actor was well received throughout his run. In December 2012, it was announced that Nichols had been let <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soap opera; Tucker made his final appearance on January 29, 2013, when he announced his move to Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Valbuena {{began his}} career at {{professional}} club Bordeaux.

In 2004, Valbuena joined Libourne Saint-Seurin in the Championnat National, the third level of French football. The midfielder had a good 2005–06 season with the club and signed with Ligue 1 club Marseille, prior to the 2006–07 season. With Marseille, Valbuena played in the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} and, in the 2009–10 season, was part of the team that won the league and league cup double, as well as the Trophée des champions.|$|E

5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
5|$|As a senior, he mostly played running back. In the 2009 TAPPS Division I {{football}} semifinals, Mark had 102 {{yards on}} 16 carries, including two rushing touchdowns and a 33-yard receiving touchdown. However, he was stopped on fourth and goal to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2-yard-line with 11 seconds left {{as the team}} lost Nolan Catholic High School 3628. Mark's senior season statistics were 23 receptions for 242 yards, 92 rushes for 772 yards and 20 total touchdowns (four on punt and kickoff returns). He also had seven touchdowns called back due to penalties. He was honored as a first team All-state selection. As a senior, he had 18 offers from schools including his five finalists: Northwestern, Arizona, Iowa State, Vanderbilt and Colorado as well as Houston, Baylor, UTEP, Virginia and Penn State. He {{was one of three}} major Division I National Letter of Intent signees from St. Pius along with Kirk Poston (defensive end, Colorado) and Greg Daniels (defensive end, Texas).|$|E
5|$|As the D-League season wound down, Rice {{emerged as}} a sleeper draft choice for the 2013 NBA draft. His {{performances}} ended up helping him <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> possibility of being undrafted to being taken {{as early as the}} late first round. He was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. On June 27, 2013, Rice was selected with the 35th overall pick of the NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but was traded to the Washington Wizards for the 38th and 54th selections, {{which turned out to be}} Nate Wolters and Arsalan Kazemi, respectively. He became the fourth player with D-League experience to be drafted and at 35th overall was the highest D-League veteran to have been drafted to that point. However, P. J. Hairston became the first D-League first-rounder when he was drafted 26th in the 2014 NBA draft to eclipse this record.|$|E

5|$|The route {{went through}} more {{mountains}} in the fifth stage. With large amounts of rain, the peloton made a truce and the stage saw few attacks. A three-man breakaway formed with around twelve kilometers to go. The riders stayed together and all sprinted for the stage win, which was originally won by Roberto Pagnin; however, due to his non-linear sprint line that interfered with the two other riders, he was relegated to second place and the original second-place finisher, Emanuele Bombini, was promoted and declared winner. The next day of racing ended with a bunch sprint won by Frank Hoste, but a crash with two kilometers to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> finish saw general classification contenders Visentini and Saronni, as well as others, lose twenty seconds. The seventh stage saw a six-man breakaway survive and finish ahead of the peloton by almost two minutes as Orlando Maini won the day.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4.
