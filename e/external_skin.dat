5|$|For the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, {{which opened}} in 1991, Tange {{designed}} a large civic centre with a plaza dominated by two skyscrapers. These house the administration offices whilst a smaller seven-storey building contains assembly facilities. In his design of a high tech version of Kofu Communications Centre, Tange equipped all three buildings with state-of-the-art building management systems that monitored air quality, light levels and security. The <b>external</b> <b>skin</b> of the building makes dual references to both tradition and the modern condition. Tange incorporated vertical and horizontal lines reminiscent of both timber boarding and the lines on semiconductor boards.|$|E
5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered <b>external</b> <b>skin</b> over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E

25|$|The human nose is a sensory organ that is {{structurally}} {{composed of}} {{three types of}} tissue: (i) an osseo-cartilaginous support framework (nasal skeleton), (ii) a mucous membrane lining, and (iii) an <b>external</b> <b>skin.</b> The anatomic topography of the human nose is a graceful blend of convexities, curves, and depressions, the contours of which show the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton. Hence, these anatomic characteristics permit dividing the nose into nasal subunits: (i) the midline (ii) the nose-tip, (iii) the dorsum, (iv) the soft triangles, (v) the alar lobules, and (vi) the lateral walls. Surgically, {{the borders of the}} nasal subunits are ideal locations for the scars, whereby is produced a superior aesthetic outcome, a corrected nose with corresponding skin colors and skin textures.|$|E

40|$|Windows – those thinner patches in the <b>external</b> <b>skins</b> of {{buildings}} that function as both barrier and channel {{between the individual}} and the outside world. They structure the facades {{of buildings}} and hence our everyday environment. They display articles of desire, technological progress and economic growth and so reveal new departures in style, aspiration and attitudes to the individual. Through the built environment in which we live, windows even function as building blocks of our personal identity. This volume illustrates how an item so central to our everyday life comes to govern aesthetic discourses concerned with openness and knowledge. It also identifies how, in the German cultural context, the literature, art and architecture of different epochs exploit the window's potential as both physical portal and metaphor for human interconnectedness, self-perception and the transcendence of the self...|$|R
2500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} cancerous tumor because {{of its ability to}} control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. [...] To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of <b>external</b> <b>skin</b> marks relative to the tumor position.|$|E

6000|$|The mucous {{membrane}} which lines the stomach is continuous with the <b>external</b> <b>skin</b> of the body; {{therefore it is}} not surprising that its texture should be affected by the nature of the food consumed, but other and more interesting changes likewise follow. Hunter long ago observed that the muscular coat of the stomach of a gull (Larus tridactylus) which had been fed for a year chiefly on grain was thickened; and, according to Dr. Edmondston, a similar change periodically occurs in the Shetland Islands in the stomach of the Larus argentatus, which in the spring frequents the cornfields and feeds on the seed. The same careful observer has noticed a great change in the stomach of a raven which had been long fed on vegetable food. In the case of an owl (Strix grallaria), similarly treated, Menetries states that the form of the stomach was changed, the inner coat became leathery, and the liver increased in size. Whether these modifications in the digestive organs would in the course of generations become inherited is not known. (24/32. For the foregoing statements see Hunter 'Essays and Observations' 1861 volume 2 page 329; Dr. Edmondston, as quoted in Macgillivray 'British Birds' volume 5 page 550: Menetries as quoted in Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 110.) ...|$|E

60|$|It is a general, but, as {{it appears}} to me, a mistaken opinion, that in our {{ordinary}} dreams we judge the objects to be real. I say our ordinary dreams;--because as to the night-mair the opinion is to a considerable extent just. But the night-mair is not a mere dream, but takes place when the waking state of the brain is recommencing, and most often during a rapid alternation, a twinkling, as it were, of sleeping and waking;--while either from pressure on, or from some derangement in, the stomach or other digestive organs acting on the <b>external</b> <b>skin</b> (which is still in sympathy with the stomach and bowels,) and benumbing it, the sensations sent up to the brain by double touch (that is, when my own hand touches my side or breast,) are so faint as to be merely equivalent to the sensation given by single touch, as when another person's hand touches me. The mind, therefore, which at all times, with and without our distinct consciousness, seeks for, and assumes, some outward cause for every impression from without, and which in sleep, by aid of the imaginative faculty, converts its judgments respecting the cause into a personal image as being the cause,--the mind, I say, in this case, deceived by past experience, attributes the painful sensation received to a correspondent agent,--an assassin, for instance, stabbing at the side, or a goblin sitting on the breast. Add too that the impressions of the bed, curtains, room, &c. received by the eyes in the half-moments of their opening, blend with, and give vividness and appropriate distance to, the dream image which returns when they close again; and thus we unite the actual perceptions, or their immediate reliques, with the phantoms of the inward sense; and in this manner so confound the half-waking, half-sleeping, reasoning power, that we actually do pass a positive judgment on {{the reality of what}} we see and hear, though often accompanied by doubt and self-questioning, which, as I have myself experienced, will at times become strong enough, even before we awake, to convince us that it is what it is--namely, the night-mair.|$|E

MethodsThe data of 12 cases of infected nonunion and exposed bone following open fracture treated in our hospital {{during the period of}} March 1998 to June 2008 were analysed. There were 10 male patients, 2 female patients, whose age were between 19 - 52 years and averaged 28 years. There were 10 tibial fractures and 2 femoral fractures. The course of diseases lasted for 12 - 39 months with the mean period of 19 months. All the cases were treated by the coupled <b>external</b> fixator and <b>skin</b> flap transposition. ResultsPrimary healing were achieved in 10 cases and delayed healing in 2 cases in whom the tibia was exposed due to soft tissue defect and hence local flap transposition was performed. All the 12 cases had bony union within 6 - 12 months after operation with the average time of 8 months. They were followed up for 1 - 3 years and all fractures healed up with good function and no infection recurrence.
