25|$|The {{animal is}} easily {{identified}} by its markings, {{most notably the}} light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its rear end. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of its ears, which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration {{makes it more difficult}} to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than prey when it is lying <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

25|$|They {{swear by}} the men among {{themselves}} who are reported {{to have been the}} most righteous and brave, by these, I say, laying hands upon their tombs; and they divine by visiting the sepulchral mounds of their ancestors and lying <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> upon them after having prayed; and whatsoever thing the man sees in his dream, this he accepts.The Berbers worshiped their kings, too. The tombs of the Numidian kings are among the most notable monuments left by the Classical Berbers.|$|E
500|$|Although Mary's will {{stated that}} {{she wished to}} be buried next to her mother, she was interred in Westminster Abbey on 14 December, in a tomb she would {{eventually}} share with Elizabeth. The Latin inscription on their tomb, Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis (affixed there by James I when he succeeded Elizabeth), translates to: [...] "Consorts in realm and tomb, we, sisters Elizabeth and Mary, here lie <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in hope of resurrection." ...|$|E
500|$|Cow tipping is {{the purported}} {{activity}} of {{sneaking up on}} any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend, and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment {{due to lack of}} other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened. They lie <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.|$|E

500|$|Aldrin entered Eagle first. With some {{difficulty}} the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing [...] of lunar surface {{material to the}} LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
500|$|Miyagi, {{delighted to}} see him, will not let him tell of his terrible mistake. Genjurō holds his {{sleeping}} son in his arms, and eventually lies <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> [...] The next morning, Genjurō wakes to the village chief knocking on his door. He is surprised to see Genjurō home, and expresses concern. He explains {{that he has been}} caring for Genjurō's son, and that the boy must have come to his old home {{in the middle of the}} night. Genjurō calls for Miyagi. The neighbor asks if Genjurō is dreaming, as his wife is dead. Miyagi's spirit tells Genjurō: [...] "I am always with you", while he continues on pottery, and their son offers food to her.|$|E
500|$|The sleeper {{carriage}} setting gave Shearsmith and Pemberton {{a number of}} [...] "traumatic" [...] elements to exploit, such as claustrophobia, proximity to strangers, motion, and the various elements associated with settling <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> such as flatulence and getting undressed. These characteristics led to elements typical of Pemberton and Shearsmith's work—characteristics of what The Guardian critic Sam Wollaston calls [...] "Shearsmith'n'Pembertonism"—including [...] "macabre horror, stiff-handling, cadaver spooning" [...] and multiple twists. Commentators stressed how the characters are generally not particularly likable people, and one critic observed that the actors are somewhat typecast; [...] "Hesmondhalgh was frumpy but compassionate, while Whitehall played yet another clueless, posh student". The characters are mostly archetypes of British comedy—such as [...] "the rude German traveller" [...] and [...] "the British snob"—and the norms of these archetypes are used for both humour and to advance the plot. The archetypes are gradually unspun; for instance, the apparently well-meaning Les is revealed as somewhat xenophobic. The discovery of the body reveals the humanity of the various characters. For instance, Jorg is revealed to be more ill than vulgar, and Hugo is shown to be poor. Maxwell's character, by contrast, is not subverted.|$|E
50|$|A Standing Baba, or Khareshwari, is a Hindu who {{has vowed}} to stand, not sitting or lying <b>down</b> even <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> The vow {{is a form of}} Hindu Tapa (or Tapasas), a self-inflicted {{corporal}} punishment intended to help bring spiritual enlightenment. Khareshwari are primarily found in India, {{but are not limited to}} that country.|$|R
50|$|The {{two of them}} argue, Hercules {{telling her}} {{that sooner or later}} she has to trust someone. She says she's already tried that and Hercules asks her if it was the slave trader that she trusted. She gets angry and says that's not who he said he was, that her and Cyrus aren't fools. Hercules gives up and tells her if she changes her mind about the food it's there for her and lays <b>down</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> She says she could use some peace and quiet.|$|R

2500|$|The average {{sleep time}} of a {{domestic}} cow is about 4 hours a day. [...] Cattle do have a stay apparatus, but do not sleep standing up, they lie <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> deeply. [...] In spite of the urban legend, cows cannot be tipped over by people pushing on them.|$|E
2500|$|Fitz Hugh's {{father had}} obvious and {{enormous}} influence on him, {{with his mother}} playing a more marginal role in his life. Abigail Woolsey Wells died {{a few months after}} Ludlow’s twelfth birthday. At her funeral, the presiding minister said that “or many years she has scarcely known what physical ease and comfort were. She labored with a body prostrated and suffering; and laid herself <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in pain.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ridgway {{was born}} March 3, 1895 in Fort Monroe, Virginia, to Colonel Thomas Ridgway, an {{artillery}} officer, and Ruth Ridgway. He lived in various military bases all throughout his childhood. He later remarked that his [...] "earliest memories are {{of guns and}} Marching men, of rising {{to the sound of}} the reveille gun and lying <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at night while the sweet, sad notes of 'Taps' brought the day officially to an end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good! Go!" [...] {{said the}} Colonel abruptly, and settled <b>down</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> once more. He knew that with Orientals {{it is the}} silent man who {{is most likely to}} have his way.|$|R

2500|$|Ruaha was the matriarch of Basel's {{elephant}} {{group and}} was one of the five original African elephants that came to Basel into the new elephant house. Similar to elderly humans, signs of her 59 years alive were visible and she did not lay <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for her last 20 years. [...] Nevertheless, her death came unexpectedly as she did not have any health problems the days before her death. Ruaha was found dead in the outdoor exhibit early morning on Thursday, July 29, 2010 by her zoo keeper.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous anecdotes is Seongcheol's Jangjwa Bulwa (Hangul: 장좌불와, Hanja: 長坐不臥). [...] Literally {{translated}} as 'long sitting, no lying,' it is a meditation technique that some monks employ to intensify their practice. [...] Sitting meditation is equivalent to most other practices, except that the practitioner does not lie <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> but stays in the lotus position even during sleep, {{with the intention of}} minimizing sleep through the position. [...] Seongcheol was known to have practiced this for eight years after his enlightenment. [...] He reportedly never once lied down and denied sleeping at all.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the [...] people [...] absent on a feasting {{expedition}} {{to meet a}} great party from Taumutu, Akaroa, Orawenua [...] They were returning.

6000|$|... “I can quite {{understand}} that you would rather be on deck than lying <b>down</b> and trying <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> I am sure I should do so myself, and even now {{the thought of the}} peril you were in makes me shudder.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Lamon {{took this}} so seriously that his friend Leonard Swett recounted {{that in the}} three months he stayed with Lamon in the Fall of 1864, he saw Lamon leave every night to go to the White House where he patrolled the grounds. Presidential {{secretary}} John Hay adds to this portrait of devotion by noting in his diary that one night he observed Lamon wrap himself up in his cloak and lie <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in front of Lincoln's bedroom door. [...] Lamon was not in Washington on the night of Lincoln's assassination, being on assignment in Richmond. [...] In his Recollections of Abraham Lincoln Lamon reveals that before he left for Richmond, he implored the president not to [...] "go out at night after [...] was gone, particularly to the theatre." [...] After the assassination, Lamon accompanied the funeral procession to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|... "Winnow": The {{winnowing}} {{process is}} performed by throwing up the grain, after being trodden down, {{against the wind}} with a shovel. The threshing-floor, which was commonly on the harvest-field, was carefully leveled with a large cylindric roller and consolidated with chalk, that weeds might not spring up, and {{that it might not}} chop with drought. The farmer usually remained all night in harvest-time on the threshing-floor, not only for the protection of his valuable grain, but for the winnowing. That operation was performed in the evening to catch the breezes which blow after the close of a hot day, and which continue for the most part of the night. This duty at so important a season the master undertakes himself; and, accordingly, in the simplicity of ancient manners, Boaz, a person of considerable wealth and high rank, laid himself <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on the barn floor, {{at the end of the}} heap of barley he had been winnowing.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{accordingly}} lay <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> {{but he was}} {{too excited}} to close his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are splendid fellows," [...] Lisle said. [...] "I {{really do}} not know what we should have done without them. There would be no talking of lying <b>down</b> and going <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> if they were not there to look after the men." ...|$|R
