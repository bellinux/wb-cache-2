Very large female Murray cod can have <b>egg</b> counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an <b>egg</b> count of 110,000 viable eggs. <b>Egg</b> counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} the <b>egg</b> {{was shot in}} post-production. A fiberglass <b>egg</b> was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the <b>egg</b> while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the <b>egg</b> was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's <b>egg</b> was used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to the Alien <b>egg</b> that appears in the finished film.|$|E

50|$|The <b>eggs</b> of S. mansonoides {{provide an}} example of the general {{morphological}} characteristics of Spirometra <b>eggs.</b> S. mansonoides <b>eggs</b> resemble the <b>eggs</b> of D. latum, with some specific differences. S. mansonoides <b>eggs</b> measure 57-66 µm by 33-37 µm, which is smaller than the <b>eggs</b> of D. latum. The <b>eggs</b> of S. mansonoides are also ellipsoidal and have a conical, prominent operculum.|$|R
5|$|After being {{released}} from the ovary, the <b>egg</b> is swept into the fallopian tube by the fimbria, which is a fringe of tissue {{at the end of}} each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized <b>egg</b> will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.|$|E
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the <b>egg,</b> the male incubates the <b>egg</b> while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the <b>egg</b> to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its <b>egg.</b> Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one <b>egg</b> a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive <b>egg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the <b>egg</b> from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each <b>egg</b> contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the <b>egg.</b> Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|Dragon's <b>Egg</b> is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's <b>Egg</b> is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's <b>Egg.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Eggs</b> are {{released}} in batches. Notothenioids {{are known for}} nesting and guarding their <b>eggs</b> to ensure protection from predators, improve oxygen content of water around <b>eggs</b> and dispose of dead or damaged <b>eggs.</b> Whether or not these <b>eggs</b> are pelagic or attached to the seafloor, rocks or sponges depends on the species of fish. Crocodile icefish tend to have either <b>eggs</b> attached to the seafloor and with <b>eggs</b> attached to the pelvic fin. Bathydraconids guard <b>eggs</b> on the seafloor of shallow waters. Both harpagiferids and artedidraconids also guard their <b>eggs</b> by attaching them to the seafloor.|$|R
500|$|Essentially all beetles lay <b>eggs,</b> {{though some}} {{myrmecophilous}} Aleocharinae and some Chrysomelinae which live in mountains or the subarctic are ovoviviparous, laying <b>eggs</b> which hatch almost immediately. Beetle <b>eggs</b> generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the Cupedidae have hard <b>eggs.</b> <b>Eggs</b> vary widely between species: the <b>eggs</b> {{tend to be}} small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of <b>eggs.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy <b>Egg</b> Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid <b>egg</b> from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the <b>egg</b> to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E

50|$|Paleontologists' {{knowledge}} {{of the structure of}} dinosaur <b>eggs</b> is limited to the hard shell. However, it can be inferred that dinosaur <b>eggs</b> had an amnion, chorion, and an allantois, the three major membranes in modern bird and reptile <b>eggs.</b> Dinosaur <b>eggs</b> vary greatly in size and shape, but even the largest dinosaur <b>eggs</b> (Megaloolithus) are smaller than the largest known bird <b>eggs,</b> which were laid by the extinct elephant bird. Dinosaur <b>eggs</b> range in shape from spherical to highly elongated (some specimens three times longer than they are wide). Some elongated <b>eggs</b> are symmetrical, whereas others have one rounded end and one pointed end (similar to bird <b>eggs).</b> Most elongated <b>eggs</b> were laid by theropods and have an avian-like eggshell, whereas the spherical <b>eggs</b> typically represent non-theropod dinosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Vertebrate <b>eggs</b> can be {{classified}} by the relative amount of yolk. Simple <b>eggs</b> with little yolk are called microlecithal, medium-sized <b>eggs</b> with some yolk are called mesolecithal, and large <b>eggs</b> with a large concentrated yolk are called macrolecithal. This classification of <b>eggs</b> {{is based on the}} <b>eggs</b> of chordates, though the basic principle extends to the whole animal kingdom.|$|R
5|$|In wasps, as {{in other}} Hymenoptera, sex is {{determined}} by a haplodiploid system, which means that females are unusually closely related to their sisters, enabling kin selection to favour the evolution of eusocial behaviour. Females are diploid, meaning that they have 2n chromosomes and develop from fertilized eggs. Males have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilized <b>egg.</b> Wasps store sperm inside their body and control its release for each individual <b>egg</b> as it is laid; if a female wishes to produce a male <b>egg,</b> she simply lays the <b>egg</b> without fertilizing it. Therefore, under most conditions in most species, wasps have complete voluntary control over the sex of their offspring. Experimental infection of Muscidifurax uniraptor with the bacterium Wolbachia induced thelytokous reproduction and an inability to produce fertile, viable male offspring.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an <b>egg.</b> If the <b>egg</b> is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male.
