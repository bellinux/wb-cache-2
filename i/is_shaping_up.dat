However, both Carl Williott and Mike Wass were disappointed, with the latter claiming: [...] "this era <b>is</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> to be even worse than I imagined."

[...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which <b>is</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> {{to be one}} of the year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
