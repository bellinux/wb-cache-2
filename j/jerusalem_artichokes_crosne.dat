Objectives The prebiotic potential of poly-fructans extracted from native <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tubers on the survivability of B. bifidum and E. coli was evaluated in this study. Methods In this experimental study, 24 treatments divided to 2 groups (Extracted poly-fructose from <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tubers and standard inulin) randomly. The turbidity and pH variations during 48 hours incubation were determined using final concentrations {{of each group}} (0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (w/v)). The data were analyzed by MINITAB 14 and MSTATC statistical software, one way ANOVA and Duncan’s test. Results This study suggests that <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> tuber fructooligosaccharides (JA-Fr) {{had the potential to}} be used as a prebiotic component. The growth of B. bifidum improved significantly in the presence of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> fructans compared to the control. There was no significant differences (P < 0. 05) in Bifidobacterium population in different concentrations of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> poly-fructans, but the population was significantly higher than the count in the presence of HP-inulin. The pH decreased in both media during 48 hours incubation time.

The effects of diff erent drying methods (freeze drying, spray drying and vacuum drying) on the properties of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> pectin were evaluated and they were compared with apple pectin. FTIR spectral analysis showed no major structural diff erences in <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> pectin samples produced by various drying treatments. The antioxidant activities of pectin dried by diff erent methods were investigated using in vitro hydroxyl and DPPH radical scavenging systems. The results revealed that the activities of spray dried pectin (SDP) and apple pectin (AP) were stronger than those of vacuum oven dried pectin (ODP) and vacuum freeze dried pectin (FDP). Therefore compared {{with the other two}} drying methods, the spray drying method was the best...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the potential of existing genotypes of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Helianthus tuberosus L.) as biomass feedstock for ethanol production. We investigated the biomass productivity and chemical composition of twenty-six <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> clones grown in a semi-arid region of China. <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> was demonstrated to be a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. All structural and non-structural carbohydrates in whole plant of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> could be 5000 L/ha. The above-ground biomass of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>artichoke</b> could be a promising feedstock for cellulosic ethanol. The ethanol potential yield from cellulose and hemicellulose in aboveground biomass were 1821 to 5930 L/ha, contributing 29. 8 - 66. 4 % of the total ethanol yield, which {{could be as high}} as that from switchgrass and sweet sorghum stem. Large variation among the investigated genotypes for carbohydrates makes it possible to select suitable clones to be used in bioethanol production in semiarid regions. Clones HB- 3, HEN- 3, IM- 1, SC- 1, SHX- 3, SX- 2 and ZJ- 2 yielded tuber total soluble sugar higher than 4. 0 t/ha. Clones BJ- 4, HUB- 2, HUN- 2, QH- 1, SD- 2 and SHH- 1 produced more than 5. 0 t/ha cellulose and hemicellulose in above-ground biomass. Clones BJ- 4 and HUB- 2 have the highest ethanol potential based on structural carbohydrates. These clones were promising material if used as biofuel feedstock in this growth condition...|$|R
