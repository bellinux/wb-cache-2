5|$|By {{virtue of}} his {{performances}} with the Services team and his seniority in Australian cricket, Hassett appeared certain to succeed Bradman as captain; his only rival for the position was NSW captain Arthur Morris, the third selector during the tour of England. The season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team, started with Bradman's testimonial match, in which Hassett led a team against the retiring Australian leader. Hassett scored 35 and 102 and the match ended with the scores tied. Bradman's outfit managed to fall short of the victory by the smallest possible margin, ending one run short of their target with one wicket remaining {{at the end of}} the final over. Hassett continued his liking for the Queensland attack, scoring 104 and 205 in Victoria’s two matches against their northern opponents for the year. Victoria did not <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> as a team, winning two and losing one of the six matches in which Hassett played, as New South Wales took the title. The summer finished with Hassett captaining a team against an eleven led by Morris. The match was designated as a trial for the selection of the Australian team to tour South Africa the following summer. Hassett scored 73 and 159 and top-scored in both innings; Morris 66 and 12. However, Hassett’s effort was not enough to stop an eight-wicket defeat after Morris’s men took a 377-run first innings lead. Morris and Hassett were the first and third highest run-scorers for the 1948–49 season. Hassett ended the season with 855 runs at 61.07.|$|E

By 1985, Israeli forces withdrew to a 15km wide southern strip of Lebanon, following which the conflict continued on a lower scale, with relatively low casualties on both sides. In 1993 and 1996, Israel launched major operations against the Shiite militia of Hezbollah, {{which had become}} an emergent threat. In May 2000, the newly elected government of Ehud Barak authorized a withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, fulfilling an election promise to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> ahead of a declared deadline. The hasty withdrawal lead to the immediate collapse of the South Lebanon Army, and many members either got arrested or fled to Israel.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, a five-part series, , on the Showtime Network, refuted {{many of the}} long-held {{misconceptions about}} the AFL. In it, Abner Haynes tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm {{is quoted as saying}} that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost; George Blanda makes a case for more AFL players being {{inducted}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer Willie Brown was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker Charlie Hennigan in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break Lionel Taylor's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown, Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> against a Hall of Fame DB, he deserves induction, as well.|$|E

[...] Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: [...] "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," [...] whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: [...] "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever." [...] and added, [...] "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote [...] "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." [...] regarding the 8th season.|$|E

However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though he did say that her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was the biggest thing that she has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in her life that will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E

2500|$|A long-running {{supporter}} of the Liberal Democrats having previously being a Labour party voter, Cleese switched to the SDP after their formation in 1981, and during the 1987 general election, Cleese recorded a nine-minute party political broadcast for the SDP–Liberal Alliance, which spoke about the similarities and failures {{of the other two}} parties in a more humorous tone than standard political broadcasts. Cleese has since appeared in broadcasts for the Liberal Democrats, in the 1997 general election and narrating a radio election broadcast for the party during the 2001 general election. In April 2010, Cleese expressed his support for the Liberal Democrats on Twitter after Nick Clegg performed strongly in the first leaders' debate on ITV1, stating: [...] "Well, well, well.

Thurl Bailey, who was relied on for 19 {{points per game}} the previous season, saw his playing time reduced in favor of rookie Blue Edwards, who played a prominent role with the team. [...] The results were the best win–loss mark in team history, as the Jazz finished with a win-loss record of , second in the division to the San Antonio Spurs (56–26). Malone had his best season statistically, averaging 31.0 points and 11.1 rebounds. [...] Stockton averaged 17.2 points and 14.5 assists per game, both career highs, with the assist total and average leading the NBA that season. [...] In the NBA Playoffs, the Jazz played the Phoenix Suns in the first round, led by All-Stars Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson. [...] The Suns defeated the Jazz 3 games to 2.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his tutoring and lecturing, Gaskell campaigned for better education for the working classes, co-founding the Lancashire Public Schools Association in 1847.

In 1861, he helped to organise {{a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science which brought scientists from across the world to Manchester. [...] Gaskell seemed to relish the immense teaching burden he accumulated in later life. Elizabeth Gaskell complained that 'you might as well ask St Pauls to tumble down, as entreat him to give up this piece of work; which does interest him very much, & which no one could <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> certainly...' Though she was referring specifically to his Owens College lectures, he seems to have diligently pursued all his various projects, and found excuses to avoid giving up any obligation he had once started.|$|E

Not only did they form a mutual dislike, but Sir John also believed Lanrezac was about to advance further, whereas in fact Lanrezac wanted to fall back from his strong position behind the angle of the Rivers Sambre and Meuse, but was forbidden to do so by Joffre. Concerned at having to guard against a German Meuse crossing south of Sedan, at Mezieres, or (most likely) at Namur north of Givet, Lanrezac urged that he be allowed to retreat to Maubeuge to avoid being flanked.|$|E
