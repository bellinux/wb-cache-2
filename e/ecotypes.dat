5|$|The {{identified}} seven <b>ecotypes</b> inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca <b>ecotypes</b> in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific <b>ecotypes</b> are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining <b>ecotypes</b> as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E
5|$|These {{characteristics}} are genetically inherited {{and has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process. The two <b>ecotypes</b> will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation is achieved. At the moment, both <b>ecotypes</b> are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered a single species.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six <b>ecotypes</b> – genetically and ecologically {{distinct}} populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf <b>ecotypes</b> were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or <b>ecotypes</b> may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>ecotypes</b> of {{the common}} {{bottlenose}} dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, {{but they have been}} shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.|$|E
5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three <b>ecotypes</b> defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on {{limestone}} bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Data on {{bodyweight}} and 11 body {{measurements were}} taken on 51 Fulani and 101 Yoruba <b>ecotype</b> chicken from two central poultry markets: Ilorin {{in the middle}} belt and Ibadan in the southwest region of Nigeria, respectively. The aim was to provide baseline information on size characteristics of Fulani and Yoruba <b>ecotype</b> chickens, differentiate between the types and use the morphometrical variables for a preliminary assessment of type and function. Results showed that least square means of live weight, wing and shank length, body, thigh and toe length, beak length and breast breadth of the Fulani <b>ecotype</b> were generally higher (P < 0. 01) {{than those of the}} Yoruba <b>ecotype.</b> The males were also superior (P < 0. 01) to the females for comb, wing, shank length and breast breadth while live weight, toe and thigh length also differ (P< 0. 05) within each <b>ecotype.</b> Thecomb of males was more prominent than those of the females. Coefficients of variation were very small signifying a monotypic condition and an almost equal opportunity of selection for type based on body parameters of the two <b>ecotype</b> chickens. The Fulani <b>ecotype</b> was bigger than the Yoruba <b>ecotype</b> chicken. The significantly longer (p< 0. 05) bodies of the Fulani suggests a departure in function between the genotypes. The Fulani chickens appear more closely suited for egg production than the Yoruba type. Their potential for developing a more adapted commercial stock and genetic improvement of the chickens for the region andother implications of type on function are discussed...|$|R
25|$|All young tulip {{trees and}} most mature {{specimens}} are intolerant of prolonged inundation; however, a coastal plain swamp <b>ecotype</b> {{in the southeastern}} United States is relatively flood-tolerant. This <b>ecotype</b> is recognized by its blunt-lobed leaves, which may have a red tint.|$|R
5|$|Regionally {{developed}} <b>ecotypes</b> can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct <b>ecotypes</b> with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{widespread}} tolerance {{seems to}} be the norm for ectomycorrhizal fungi, adaptive metal tolerance has been suggested for a few fungi such as Pisolithus tinctorius, P. albus and species in the genus Suillus. Fungal <b>ecotypes</b> specialized to high levels of heavy metals {{have been found to be}} adapted to high levels of Al, Zn, Cd and Cu. Interestingly, a reduced number of species is known to be adapted to different metals with different <b>ecotypes</b> arising recurrently. This suggests that some species are more prone to adapt to chemically inhospitable edaphic environments. Suillus luteus and S. bovinus are good examples, with known <b>ecotypes</b> adapted to Zn, Cd and Cu. These differentiated populations accumulate lower heavy metal concentrations in their mycelia and in a slower fashion compared to sensitive <b>ecotypes.</b> More specifically, the accumulation of heavy metals in the fungal tissue is prevented through a mechanism that efficiently exports metals to the outside of the cell. When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Caribou herds are {{classified}} by <b>ecotype</b> depending on several behavioural factors - predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration (sedentary or migratory).

25|$|Two {{subspecies}} {{have been}} described. Subspecies perfoliatus {{occurs in the}} Old World. In North America, populations on the eastern seaboard and the Gulf States {{are considered to be}} subsp. bupleuroides. Since many pondweeds, including P. perfoliatus, vary naturally in response to growing conditions, it is possible that these variants are <b>ecotypes</b> rather than genuine subspecies. The related P. richardsonii was formerly considered a subspecies of P. perfoliatus, but is now classed as a separate species.|$|E
25|$|At least morphologically, G. gardneri and the Southern Hemisphere {{species are}} the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be {{unequivocally}} recognised. The remainder may have been <b>ecotypes</b> or subspecies. The implications would be that G. biloba had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation. While it may seem improbable that a species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit. These are: extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution coupled with, as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record, extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).|$|E

25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower development pathway. Allelic variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana <b>ecotypes</b> that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E
25|$|A {{maternal}} mitochondrial, paternal Y chromosome, and microsatellite {{assessment of}} two wolf populations in North America and combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou, and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Though these two populations spend {{a period of}} the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence. A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf <b>ecotypes</b> survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the issues}} that many {{researchers}} and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and any of the wolf species mixed into the hybrid. The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is phenotyping, a method that involves observing the animal's physical features. This method is often favoured for many in determining the degree of wolf and northern spitz-type dog that is in a hybrid. However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that phenotyping cannot always determine the wolf-contents accurately. Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture {{due to the fact that}} dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in various subspecies with many different regional <b>ecotypes</b> hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding. Although wolves are often mixed with spitz types such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds, hybrids between wolves to non-Spitz type dogs such as Poodles, Pit bulls, and Great Pyrenees also exist, the latter hybrids often having less lupine features.|$|E

500|$|There are {{numerous}} subspecies of elk described, with six from North America and four from Asia, although some taxonomists consider them different <b>ecotypes</b> or races {{of the same}} species (adapted to local environments through minor changes in appearance and behavior).

500|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} {{process by which}} an organism becomes better able to live in its environment. The genetic differences between wolf populations is tightly associated with their type of habitat, and wolves [...] disperse primarily within the type of habitat that they were born into. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. In the Late Pleistocene the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf <b>ecotypes</b> that were genetically, morphologically, and ecologically distinct from each another. The term ecomorph is used to describes a recognizable association of the morphology of an organism or a species with their use of the environment. The Beringian wolf ecomorph shows evolutionary craniodental plasticity not seen in past nor present North American gray wolves, and was well-adapted to the megafauna-rich environment of the Late Pleistocene.|$|E

Nash [Surat Thani ecotype] and Vetiveria nemoralis A. Camus [Prajoub Kirikhan ecotype] in constructed wetlands with Free Water Surface (FWS) of tannery wastewater. Twelve experiments of constructed wetland system were built, nine of them were used to study the efficiency of chromium removal and other three units were used to study on plants growth. Wastewater depths in this study were 0. 10 m, 0. 15 m and 0. 20 m in each three units. FWS with Surat Thani <b>ecotype</b> at water level 0. 10 m was the best performance for chromium removal which their efficiency was 89. 29 %. While the efficiency of Prajoub Kirikhan <b>ecotype</b> at water level 0. 15 m was 86. 30 % and the lowest efficiency was found in control unit at 0. 10 m was 80. 72 %.
