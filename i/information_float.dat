40|$|In {{the longer}} {{introduction}} of Radical History Review’s two thematic issues “Queering Archives,” we frame the archive as an evasive and dynamic space animated by the tensions of knowledge production, absence, and presence. As Jeffrey Weeks argued in RHR in 1979, “The evolution of sexual meanings and identities {{that we have}} traced over the past hundred years or so {{are by no means}} complete. ” 1 Fragments of <b>information</b> <b>float</b> unfixed — historically unraveled — and we form archives when we pull the fragments into the orbit of efforts to know. Yet the business of knowing is unsteady, as scholars of sexuality and gender have amply demonstrated. Between the fraught and necessary practices of historicization, anachronism, interpretation, bias, and partial readings that propel historical scholarship, archival fragments fall {{in and out of the}} frame of an easily perceptible knowledge. Queer historical knowledge thus is evasive — like a coin dropped in the ocean and for which one grasps, reaching it only for it to slip away again, rolling deeper into the beyond. To say that the knowledge work of animating queer historical fragments is marked by such slipperiness is to underline how the archive negotiates the decomposition and recomposition of knowledge’s materials. We pull and push at the fading paper, the fraying fabric, the photographs bleaching into their backgrounds, and manipulate technologies on their way to obsolescence, all as part of some suturing effort of one kind or another...|$|E

The member of the touring party was standing next to the PA with a sign protesting {{some of the things they}} found offensive about the bands jokes, and props on stage.

This work presents our first steps towards gaze-mounted in-formation visualization and interaction, determining bound-ary conditions for such an approach. We propose a general concept for information presentation at an angular offset to the line of sight. A user can look around freely, yet having information attached nearby the line of sight. Whenever the user wants to look at the information and does so, the infor-mation is placed directly at the axis of sight for a short time. Based on this concept we investigate how users understand frames of reference, specifically, if users relate directions and alignments in head or world coordinates. We further inves-tigate if information may have a preferred motion behavior. Prototypical implementations of three variants are presented to users in guided interviews. The three variants resemble a rigid offset and two different floating motion behaviors of the <b>information.</b> <b>Floating</b> algorithms implement an inertia based model and either allow the user’s gaze to surpass the informa-tion or to push information with the gaze.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the ability of AutoMOD as a flexible modeling tool. Simulation models of material handling systems like those found in automotive paint shops & assembly systems often require many variables, conveyor speeds, and complex logic. These systems have many different variables associated with them. The most important ones are: conveyor speeds, carrier counts, routing <b>information,</b> <b>floating</b> carrier numbers between two control points, active and inactive station information, station operation times, and shift schedules. In order for a simulation analyst to control or experiment with a material handling system, he or she will usually have to vary one or more of these variables. In the past, this has meant that these “hard-coded ” variables would have to be changed one by one through menus for each material handling segment or system. Other methods including the use of AutoStat or AWK could be used to change certain parameters without having to visit the edit menus in AutoMOD. This paper will address how users can use external data files to control these traditionally “hard-coded ” variables, thereby allowing simulation analysts and their customers to drive their material handling systems as they have traditionally used external files to provide process information for their models. PMC’s approach was to create a flexible and robust model that imports all of these system parameters from external data files. This allows for an increase in model efficiency if model experimentation is large and involves many different physical changes. Using this method, a potential customer can modify these parameters for experimentation with a run-time version of AutoMOD simulation software. 1...|$|R

Starting from the Ising model of statistical physics, we use a discretized space-time traffic description, on which we define and study an inference method based on the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. The idea is to encode into a graph the a priori information derived from historical data (marginal probabilities of pairs of variables), and to use BP to estimate the actual state from the latest FCD. The behavior of the algorithm is illustrated by numerical studies on a simple simulated traffic network. The generalization to the superposition of many traffic patterns is discussed. I...|$|R
