40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{increase}} of household debt in Serbia {{as well as in}} the entire region has brought the issue of personal bankruptcy into the spotlight. The adoption of this procedure would enable individuals who are over-indebted and unable to settle out the credit and current payables to file for personal bankruptcy. The main objective of this procedure would be to ensure the maximum reimbursement of creditors' claims from the debtor's available assets and annual revenues. Such a procedure would also provide for the protection of the debtor's basic human rights and dignity. In order to provide a fresh start for the debtor and his financial standing, bankruptcy proceedings commonly include <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs,</b> to some extent. Obviously, personal bankruptcy has two sets of goals, which are mutually inconsistent, contradictory and often incompatible. In order to prevent possible abuses, bankruptcy reasons must be clearly defined and set out in more rigorous terms. This paper analyzes the impact of personal bankruptcy in generating the global economic crisis and the repercussion that personal bankruptcy has had on the global economy. The increase in the number of bankruptcy proceedings filed in the USA in 2005 was a warning about the forthcoming events. Mortgage loans were the major reason for filing a large number of personal bankruptcy claims. In fact, until 2006 the US real estate market had been booming but no one could have guessed then that the real estate values would fall sharply in the years to come. Credit deregulation caused higher demand for mortgage backed loans and the nation's household debt increased significantly. However, the negative selection of debtors, their insolvency and irregular payment of annuities caused turmoil, which generated major problems for financial institutions. At the end of 2007, nearly 16 percent of all mortgage loans were uncollectible in full. The analysis of events that led to the onset of the global economic crisis and the role of personal bankruptcy as its most probable cause yields a conclusion that the adequate legal regulation of this process is paramount. The experiences of countries that have already introduced this legal institute are invaluable. The countries in the region which have set too rigorous rules for <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs</b> are currently facing the option of undertaking massive write-offs of debtors' claims, which are most unlikely to be objective. On the other hand, in the countries which have envisaged too flexible proceedings for <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs,</b> there is a negative selection of debtors and default of financial institutions. With this experience in mind, it is necessary to regulate and apply the institute of personal bankruptcy so that it provides for the maximum debt collection as well as for accomplishing the major social goals...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{sovereign}} debt relief {{in a long-term}} perspective. We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920 - 1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978 - 2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external creditors. Debt relief was substantial in both eras, averaging 21 % of GDP in the 1930 s and 16 % of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980 s/ 1990 s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs.</b> Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings...|$|R
50|$|In The Telegraph, one of England's major newspapers, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard {{described}} the report in positive terms. The article deals {{with both the}} historical {{as well as other}} arguments. In addition, it is mentioned that two of the most prominent economists of the 20th century, Henry Simons and Irving Fisher, were the fathers of the original Chicago Plan, and they consider Richard Werner a contemporary economist with basically the same agenda. Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, a writer at the Open Salon, regards the section on economic history as the most interesting, for example that it is a myth that money is developed from physical objects with intrinsic value, say gold, into today's 'fiat money', the reason being that fiat money, which is characterized {{by the fact that the}} value is determined by law, has been used for thousands of years. In this context, she is referring to the Athenian leader Solon, whose <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs</b> in 599 B.C. are described as the first known Chicago Plan. She concludes by noting that the movement to eradicating the debt-based monetary system is still considered radical, but the fact that an IMF study now positions itself to the radical side, suggests that the global crisis is much greater than our governments and mainstream media are willing to acknowledge and also that people in high positions know that the decision makers basically are lacking alternatives.|$|R

40|$|The Migration Act {{requires}} that a non-citizen who is detained {{is liable to}} pay the Australian government the costs {{of his or her}} detention. This liability includes costs for the transportation of the person to and from an immigration detention centre and the daily maintenance amount for each day the person spends in detention. In certain circumstances, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) may write off a person’s debt where it has been determined uneconomical to pursue. Additionally, a person may apply to the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) to request a waiver of their debt. A write off does not extinguish the debt owing to the Australian government: it is merely an accounting entry and the recovery of the debt may be pursued at a later date. By contrast, a debt that is waived cannot be reinstated and is extinguished for all time. A non-citizen who has a debt owing to the Australian government may be refused a visa and/or be prevented from entering Australia at a later date if the debt has not been paid or if appropriate arrangements have not been made to repay the debt. Complaints to the Ombudsman’s office highlighted some inconsistencies with DIAC’s administration of debts. Some people complained about significant delay in processing a waiver request.

40|$|With {{continued}} operating surpluses and {{low levels}} of debt, this report finds that Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s university sector remains in a relatively healthy financial position, but that active management is required given that operating surpluses have continued their decline since 2009. Summary This report covers the results of the 2013 financial audits of 64 entities, comprising eight universities and the 56 entities they control. Clear audit opinions were issued on the financial reports of 59 entities. Two qualified opinions were issued, relating to the financial reports of Deakin University and The University of Melbourne, {{as a result of their}} accounting treatments of grants received in 2013. Three entities are yet to finalise their financial reports. The eight universities generated a net surplus of 381. 7 million in 2013, a decrease of 73 million from 2012. With continued operating surpluses and {{low levels of}} debt, the university sector remains in a relatively healthy financial position. However, active management is required given that operating surpluses have continued their decline since 2009. While student revenue and the number of students enrolled in higher education continue to increase, they mask a significant decline in domestic and international vocational education and training student numbers during 2013. Three universities were assessed as having a high risk to self-financing in 2013. The remaining five were assessed as having a medium risk. This indicates that some universities may be unable to fund asset replacement in future periods from cash generated from their operations. In 2013 Monash University signed agreements with a private sector entity to assume control of its South African operations. From 2001 to 2013 Monash University provided 101. 8 million in loan funding to its subsidiary entities associated with the South Africa campus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify the {{hypothesis}} that a <b>debt</b> <b>write-off</b> implemented recently by Polish authorities in favour of public hospitals constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union. The paper contains a detailed description of the nature of the measure – its historical background, regulatory context, as well as its construction. It presents an in-depth analysis of the fulfilment by the measure of the conditions stipulated in Article 107 (1) TFEU. As a preliminary issue, the analysis addresses the problem whether Polish public hospitals can be considered as undertakings within the meaning of EU competition law, particularly, as to their activity financed by the sickness fund organized under the principle of social solidarity. The answer to this question seems to be affirmative and in line with the landmark Hoefner and Elser judgments where the ECJ held that the way in which an entity is financed is irrelevant for its classification as an undertaking. The paper argues in favour of the thesis that the <b>debt</b> <b>write-off</b> must be considered as affecting trade between Member States and competition.

Although {{a few of}} the larger ones are banks, the vast majority are loan funds, often with hybrid funding models involving a mixture of grants and loans for on-lending. The resilience of the financial models is examined, firstly with a survey of experts on funding and risk issues, followed by financial modelling of three risk scenarios that were considered likely by the experts. The modelling suggests that for a typical CDFI lending to businesses or civil society organisations, significant increases in bad <b>debt</b> <b>write-off</b> rates would have a larger impact than cuts in revenue funding or delays in capital funding.

40|$|In May 1992, the World Bank {{hosted a}} Railway Rountable in Vienna, Austria, {{attended}} by transport ministers, advisors, and senior railway staff from the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The Roundtable reviewed recent {{trends in the}} railways'roles in these countries and identified appropriate actions to address emerging transport issues in the CEE region. The Bank prepared this strategy paper based on the discussions and the apparent widespread consensus that emerged at the Rountable. The financial situation of the CEE railways is beginning to deteriorate rapidly, and the CEE railways are not well positioned to provide good, reliable service to their increasingly market-driven customers. These countries are thus under increasing pressure to restructure their railways to relieve financial pressures and meet future needs. Railways in market economies have faced a steadily declining role in the transport market, and have typically dealt with emerging problems by tinkering at the margin - for example, by <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs</b> - and thus delaying attacking their underlying structural problems. Many of these governments {{have come to the}} conclusion that drastic surgeryis required - as illustrated by the British, German, and Japanese railways. The agenda for change that emerged from this Roundtable emphasized developing a strategic plan for restructuring the railway. This plan should define the market; project the level of activity (tons, ton-kilometers and freight tariffs, passenger-kilometers and passenger fares) for all business activities; include a five-year financial plan for the different lines of railway business (to make options concrete); and define all government policies and changes that would put the railway on a level playing field with competing modes of transportation. One item on the agenda for change is to convert the current railway enterprise operating under normal commercial law. The board of directors should include representatives from government, the railway executive and high-level business or public representatives from outside of government. Formation of JSC or independent enterprise does not necessarily imply privatization of the railway because the underlying assets may well remain in public hands. The objective is to change the enterprises'authority and enhance their commercial orientation. The other item on the agenda for change is to have the explicit mission of the railway be to operate freight and intercity passenger services on a commercial basis, with revenues from services covering all costs, including a return on investment. Social services such as urban passengers, should be identified and supported by the appropriate governmental agencies.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims {{to provide}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} account receivables creating a group of accounting relations together with the liabilities. The thesis discusses the account receivables only {{from the point of}} view of the accountancy and the law, not the taxes. The basic terminology followed by the characterisation of the account receivables is defined in the theoretical part. It also includes the possibilities of the account receivables emergence and dissolution as well as the collection method.
