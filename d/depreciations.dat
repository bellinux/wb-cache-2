60|$|If {{the value}} of the maravedi had {{remained}} unchanged in Spain down to the present day, {{it would be easy to}} reduce a sum of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella into a correspondent sum of current money; but by the successive <b>depreciations</b> of the coin of Vellon, or mixed metals, issued since that period, the real and maravedi of Vellon, which had replaced the ancient currency, were reduced, towards the year 1700, to about a third of the old real and maravedi, now known as the real and maravedi of silver. As, however, the ancient piece of 8 reals was equal approximately to the ounce of silver, and the duro, or dollar of the present day, is likewise equal to an ounce, they may be considered identical. Indeed, in Spanish America, the dollar, instead of being divided into 20 reals, as in Spain, is divided into only 8 parts called reals, which evidently represent the real of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, as the dollar does the real of 8. But the ounce of silver was anciently worth 276-1/4 maravedis; the dollar, therefore, is likewise equal to 276 1/4 maravedis. By converting then the sums mentioned in this work into maravedis, they have been afterwards reduced into dollars by dividing by 276 1/4.|$|E

60|$|Now if this Utopian {{world is}} to be in some degree {{parallel}} to contemporary thought, it must have been concerned, it may be still concerned, with many unsettled problems of currency, and with the problems that centre about a standard of value. Gold is perhaps of all material substances the best adapted to the monetary purpose, but even at that best it falls far short of an imaginable ideal. It undergoes spasmodic and irregular cheapening through new discoveries of gold, and at any time it may undergo very extensive and sudden and disastrous depreciation through the discovery of some way of transmuting less valuable elements. The liability to such <b>depreciations</b> introduces an undesirable speculative element into the relations of debtor and creditor. When, on the one hand, there is for a time a check in the increase of the available stores of gold, or an increase in the energy applied to social purposes, or a checking of the public security that would impede the free exchange of credit and necessitate a more frequent production of gold in evidence, then there comes an undue appreciation of money as against the general commodities of life, and an automatic impoverishment of the citizens in general as against the creditor class. The common people are mortgaged into the bondage of debt. And on the other hand an unexpected spate of gold production, the discovery of a single nugget as big as St. Paul's, let us say--a quite possible thing--would result in a sort of jail delivery of debtors and a financial earthquake.|$|E

One more point--all the world knows it, and that [...] is why it is dangerous to omit it--our guest is a distinguished [...] citizen of the Great Republic beyond the seas. In America his [...] 'Huckleberry Finn' and his 'Tom Sawyer' are what 'Robinson [...] Crusoe' and 'Tom Brown's School Days' have been to us. They [...] are racy of the soil. They are books to which it is impossible [...] to place any period of termination. I will not speak of the [...] classics--reminiscences of much evil in our early lives. We do [...] not meet here to-day as critics with our appreciations and [...] <b>depreciations,</b> our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords. [...] I am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence [...] will think of Mark Twain. Posterity will take care of itself, [...] will read what it wants to read, will forget what it chooses to [...] forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical [...] mumblings and jumblings. Let us therefore be content to say to [...] our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves [...] and for our children, to say what he has been to us. I [...] remember in Liverpool, in 1867, first buying the copy, which I [...] still preserve, of the celebrated 'Jumping Frog.' It had a few [...] words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those [...] days was called 'the wild humorist of the Pacific slope,' and a [...] few lines later down, 'the moralist of the Main.' That was [...] some forty years ago. Here he is, still the humorist, still [...] the moralist. His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality, [...] and his morality is all the better for his humor. That is one [...] of the reasons why we love him. I am not here to mention any [...] book of his--that is a subject of dispute in my family circle, [...] which is the best and which is the next best--but I must put in [...] a word, lest I should not be true to myself--a terrible thing [...] --for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility, and of [...] manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking [...] him. But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with [...] his own intention. You can get into it what meaning you like. [...] Mark Twain is a man whom English and Americans do well to [...] honor. He is the true consolidator of nations. His delightful [...] humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national [...] prejudices. His truth and his honor, his love of truth, and [...] his love of honor, overflow all boundaries. He has made the [...] world better by his presence. We rejoice to see him here.

50|$|An {{additional}} critique {{that has}} been exposed {{is that there are}} other debt instruments that could be superior in the task of insuring risk for consumers. That is, for example, the case of CPI-indexed local currency bonds. Crises are generally accompanied by large exchange rate <b>depreciations</b> that are driven by the fall in domestic consumption. This fall in consumption decelerates the CPI growth and in turn bonds linked to it pay less during crisis. Given that economic agents are more interested in consumption smoothing than in the stabilization of output, CPI-indexed local currency bonds may provide a better insurance against shocks than GDP-linked bonds. However, these types of bonds do not allow direct exposure to real GDP growth and only permit investors to smooth out consumption if they have a natural exposure to the CPI of the nation—such as citizens of the nation.|$|E
