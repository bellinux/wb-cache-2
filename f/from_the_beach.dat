5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{reshape the}} geology near the coast by eroding sand <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> {{as well as}} offshore, rearranging coral, and changing dune configuration onshore. Their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves, creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a {{self-contained}} water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not immediately develop any holidaymaker facilities aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E

On June 26, the surviving Egyptians were rescued by Ibrahim's fleet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> {{and those who were}} not rescued had to swim to the ships or be killed by the Maniots. This battle cost Ibrahim 1,000 men and he was forced to retreat from Mani after being defeated at Vergas.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 6, 1944, American {{soldiers}} land on Omaha Beach {{as part of the}} Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting German positions defended by artillery and machine guns. Captain John H.

5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Beaches</b> {{community}} in eastern Toronto {{is an important}} location on the trail, {{being one of the}} only neighbourhoods in Toronto with residential homes next to <b>the</b> lakeshore. <b>The</b> <b>Beach</b> itself is a popular destination, hosting games of beach volleyball, and attracting many cyclists and rollerbladers. North of the waterfront are many small stores and restaurants along Queen Street and <b>The</b> Danforth. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beaches,</b> <b>the</b> trail, called the Martin Goodman Trail, runs west along the Toronto waterfront for its entire length, with only a few sections on city streets. Currently, there isn't any path running east along <b>the</b> waterfront <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beaches.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, {{with the help of}} <b>the</b> crew <b>from</b> Rodney M. Davis, 11 tons of {{creosote}} logs were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of NAVMAG, Indian Island. The project was completed with no labor cost, due to the support of Rodney M. Davis crew on this shoreline enhancement project. Removal of creosote contaminant source <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> enhances shoreline habitat and marine water quality.|$|R
5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage out of the way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E

5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E

They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E

Riding {{on the back of a}} wild hog, Crash escapes the pursuing villagers and climbs over the opposite fortress wall.|$|E
5|$|National {{and foreign}} {{visitors}} search the {{town for the}} numerous sandy beaches, sunbathing, sunsets over the ocean, tranquility and relaxation. Walking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> promenades to the old town shopping street is particularly enjoyed, as is local food, most especially seafood. Since 1970, Póvoa de Varzim became widely popular in Northern Portugal for restaurants specialized in Portuguese Piri Piri Chicken, Cabidela chicken blood rice or codfish. Reducing seasonality in tourism demand has been a city's goal, throw the development of sports and cultural tourism, this helped to decline the seasonality from 48.4% in 2001 to 44.9% in 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E
