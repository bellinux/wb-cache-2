In {{the years}} 1993 - 1994 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{introduced}} to the metrology the fundamental changes of basic character, involving - {{in addition to the}} traditional concept of measurement error - the use of new <b>fundamental</b> <b>term</b> of uncertainty of measurement. In consequence, this has led to currently undisputed axiom of metrology, that the measurement result has a form of a section on dimensional axis. These rules of presenting measurable physical values should be reflected in the of practical procedures of mathematical modeling. Presented work relates to this particular problem. It discusses the principles of mathematical modeling together with the assessment of the results. Particular attention was paid to the identification of possible systematic errors (i. e. the load of model) and to estimating the uncertainty of the statistical and deterministic modeling.

40|$|Marine {{boundary}} layer ozone seasonal cycles have been quantified by fitting {{the sum of}} two sine curves through monthly detrended observations taken at three stations: Mace Head, Ireland, and Trinidad Head, California, in the Northern Hemisphere and Cape Grim, Tasmania, in the Southern Hemisphere. The parameters defining the sine curve fits at these stations have been compared with those from a global Lagrangian chemistry-transport model and from 14 Atmospheric Chemistry Coupled Climate Model Intercomparison Project chemistry-climate models. Most models substantially overestimated the long-term average ozone levels at Trinidad Head, while they performed much better for Mace Head and Cape Grim. This led to an underestimation of the observed (North Atlantic inflow-North Pacific inflow) difference. The models generally underpredicted {{the magnitude of the}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>term</b> of the fitted seasonal cycle, most strongly at Cape Grim. The models more accurately reproduced the observed second harmonic terms compared to the fundamental terms at all stations. Significant correlations have been identified between the errors in the different models' estimates of the seasonal cycle parameters; these correlations may yield further insights into the causes of the model-measurement discrepancies...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The main aims of this {{bachelor}} thesis are {{to analyze the}} Czech political party KDU- CSL and the German political party CDU and to compare these two Christian- democratic political parties. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>term</b> political party is explained and other important terms of political studies are defined. The next part of the thesis contains the analyses of the development of KDU-ČSL and CDU. The analyses briefly decsribe the history of these two political parties and mainly aim at their development during the nineties of the 20 th century. This period is important because both political parties developed a lot due to the newly arising democratic countries. The last part of this thesis deals with the contentual comparison of KDU- ČSL and CDU. The aim is to find out a nodal point between these two parties, their similarities and differences.

40|$|A new nine-dimensional {{potential}} energy surface (PES) and dipole momentsurface (DMS) for silane have been generated using high-level ab initio theory. The PES, CBS-F 12 HL, reproduces all four <b>fundamental</b> <b>term</b> values for 28 SiH 4 with sub-wavenumber accuracy, {{resulting in an}} overall root-mean-square error of 0. 63 cm − 1. The PES is based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, and incorporates a range of higher-level additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms, and scalar relativistic effects. Systematic errors in computed intra-band rotational energy levels are reduced by empirically refining the equilibrium geometry. The resultant Si–H bond length is in excellent agreement with previous experimental and theoretical values. Vibrational transition moments, absolute line intensities of the ν 3 band, and the infrared spectrum for 28 SiH 4 including states up to J = 20 and vibrational band origins up to 5000 cm − 1 are calculated and compared with available experimental results. The DMS tends to marginally overestimate the strength of line intensities. Despite this, band shape and structure across the spectrum are well reproduced and show good agreement with experiment. We thus recommend the PES and DMS for future use...|$|E
40|$|Aiming {{movements}} with an arm (one {{to three}} joints) confined in a vertical plane {{are described in}} terms of control theory. The framework includes two levels of motor control, namely the discrete and the continuos level, both with respect to time. On the continuos level, movement control is configured for physical execution. On the discrete level, planning takes place, which covers the selection of a perceptual goal, its serialisation into a desired trajectory by pattern generation, the perceptual paralleling of the resulting actual movement trajectory by pattern recognition, and the final check whether the goal is hit. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>term</b> is the ‘tool transformation’, which quantitatively relates muscularly generated joint torques to the effects on the environment – here to the changing Cartesian positions of the arm’s tip. Feedforward control then is exerted by an inverse model of the tool transformation. The acquisition of the inverse model is guarantied by the proposed ‘learner-operator model ’ of sensorimotor control, which is based on auto-imitation combined with Hebbian learning, masters redundant degrees of freedom, and allows to quickly update the model parameters while the arm is moving. The approach relinquishes of a forward model of the tool transformation, and explains anticipation as predisposed by the perceptive goal, not as predicted by efferences flowing through a forward model...|$|E
