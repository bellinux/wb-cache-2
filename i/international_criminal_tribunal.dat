5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted.

The siege was the first instance of use of the ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatian authorities tried Mladić in absentia and convicted him for war crimes committed in Kijevo.|$|E

40|$|For centuries, rape {{has served}} as a weapon of war, despite {{criminal}} prohibitions forbidding its use. Nevertheless, only in recent decades has international law made significant strides in defining and prosecuting rape as a war crime and crime against humanity. <b>International</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>tribunals</b> prosecuting crimes of sexual violence in prior conflict zones such as Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and the former Yugoslavia have struggled to develop a coherent definition of the elements of rape. This is largely due to the unique aspects of consent and coercion that are inherent within a surrounding context of armed conflict. This Article begins by exploring the elements of rape as defined by the major <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>tribunals</b> existing today, and subsequently examines the manner in which each court considers proof of consent and coercion. It then surveys some of the recent and more progressive developments in rape law jurisprudence both domestically and internationally. Finally, this Article recommends several specific steps that <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>tribunals</b> could employ to more effectively and equitably prosecute rape as a war crime and crime against humanity...|$|R
