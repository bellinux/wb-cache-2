5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly <b>doubted.</b> <b>It</b> is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as in the case of NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview {{that he did not}} know what happened to the letter after his grandmother received it, though he <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E

25|$|The {{first case}} which {{approached}} {{the position in}} relation to competing mortgagees was Gordon v Graham.

25|$|The {{figure in}} the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left {{foreground}} of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been <b>doubted,</b> <b>it</b> is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink. Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground, in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.|$|E

500|$|Juan Seguín {{oversaw the}} 1837 {{recovery}} of the abandoned ashes and officiated at the February 25 funeral. The March 28 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register only gave the burial location as where [...] "the principal heap of ashes" [...] had been found. In the following decades, the public {{wanted to know the}} location of the burial site, but Seguín gave conflicting statements, perceived as due to age-related memory problems. Remains thought to be those of the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando during the Texas 1936 centennial, and re-interred in a marble sarcophagus. Purported to hold the ashes of Travis, Bowie and Crockett, some have <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> can be proven whose remains are entombed there.|$|E

500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> {{would turn out}} to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E
500|$|After he {{completed}} the demo, he pre-viewed the song's instrumental on a French radio station, {{but did not}} confirm which artist would contribute vocals. Guetta played the song to Rihanna whilst backstage at one of her Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11) concerts, to which Rihanna said [...] "Yeah, I like it." [...] Guetta confessed that he felt as though the singer did not like it on first impressions and <b>doubted</b> <b>it,</b> but stated that after the concert, the singer told Guetta {{that she could not}} stop thinking about the song's beat whilst she performed, and asked to record it. The final cut of the song was included on One More Love (2010) and Rihanna appeared as a featured artist. Guetta concluded the interview by saying that he felt [...] "honored" [...] to have worked with Rihanna. Prior to the release of Loud, Rihanna clarified via Twitter that [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was not linked to Loud and that it would not appear on the album.|$|E

In the summer of 1942, a Jewish labor organization (the Bund) leader, Leon Feiner got word to London that 700,000 Polish Jews had already died.

(One obolus is one sixth of one drachma, the daily salary {{of a public}} servant {{at the end of}} the 5th century BC. By the middle of the 4th century BC, this salary was up to a drachma and a half.) In the same light, Solon used taxes he levied on brothels to build a temple to Aphrodite Pandemos (literally [...] "Aphrodite of all the people").

Sun Quan <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> and said that if that really happened, he would have 1,000 cattle slaughtered for a feast in Bu Zhi's honour. Some years later, he told Lü Fan and Zhuge Ke: [...] "Every time I read Bu Zhi's memorial, I can't stop laughing. The river has existed since the beginning of life.

[...] The film's producer, James Schamus, said, [...] "I suppose movies can be Rorschach tests for all of us, but damn if these characters aren't gay to me."

2500|$|The Scarlet Letter {{was first}} {{published}} in the spring of 1850 by Ticknor & Fields, beginning Hawthorne's most lucrative period. When he delivered the final pages to Fields in February 1850, Hawthorne said that [...] "some portions of the book are powerfully written" [...] but <b>doubted</b> <b>it</b> would be popular. In fact, the book was an instant best-seller, though, over fourteen years, it brought its author only $1,500. Its initial publication brought wide protest from natives of Salem, who did not approve of how Hawthorne had depicted them in his introduction [...] "The Custom-House". A 2,500-copy second edition included a preface by Hawthorne dated March 30, 1850, that stated he had decided to reprint his Introduction [...] "without the change of a word... The only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor... As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} several lesser works, {{not all of}} which can be {{securely}} ascribed to Chrétien. Philomela {{is the only one of}} his four poems based on Ovid's Metamorphoses that has survived. [...] Two short-lyric chansons on the subject of love are also very likely his, but the attribution of the pious romance Guillaume d'Angleterre to him is now widely <b>doubted.</b> <b>It</b> has also been suggested that Chrétien might be the author of two short verse romances called Le Chevalier á l'épée and La Mule sans frein, but this theory has not found much support. Chrétien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to Cligès, where he also mentions his work about King Mark and Iseult. The latter is presumably related to the Tristan and Iseult legend, though Tristan is not named. [...] Chrétien's Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Cligès, Chrétien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive. Chrétien's works are written in vernacular Old French, although it is marked by traits of the regional Champenois dialect (which is still fairly similar to the [...] "standard" [...] French of Paris).|$|E
