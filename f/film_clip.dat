25|$|Bonham {{was married}} to Pat Phillips, and the couple had two children; Zoë Bonham (born 10 June 1975), a singer-songwriter who appears at Led Zeppelin conventions, and Jason Bonham (born 15 July 1966), a drummer who has played with UFO, Foreigner, and Bonham. He {{previously}} played in Black Country Communion with Glenn Hughes, Derek Sherinian, and Joe Bonamassa. They recorded an album called Black Country in 2010. On 10 December 2007, he played with Led Zeppelin on the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, {{as well as their}} reunion at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary show on 15 May 1988.

40|$|Abstract <b>Film</b> <b>clips</b> are an {{important}} tool for evoking emotional responses in the laboratory. When compared with other emotionally potent visual stimuli (e. g., pictures), <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> {{seem to be more}} effective in eliciting emotions {{for longer periods of time}} at both the subjective and physiological levels. The main objective of the present study was to develop a new database of affective <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> without auditory content, based on a dimensional approach to emotional stimuli (valence, arousal and dominance). The study had three different phases: (1) the pre-selection and editing of 52 <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> (2) the self-report rating of these <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> by a sample of 113 participants and (3) psy-chophysiological assessment [skin conductance level (SCL) and the heart rate (HR) ] on 32 volunteers. <b>Film</b> <b>clips</b> from different categories were selected to elicit emotional states from different quadrants of affective space. The results also showed that sustained exposure to the affective <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> resulted in a pattern of a SCL increase and HR deceleration in high arousal conditions (i. e., horror and erotic conditions). The resulting emotional movie database can reliably be used in research requiring the presentation of non-auditory <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> with different ratings of valence, arousal and dominance...|$|R

25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days was long gone along with most of the hair on top of his head. In the brief <b>film</b> <b>clip,</b> he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson. Later that day, in the official film made of the fight, Bat can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just {{prior to the start of}} the fight.|$|E

40|$|Using {{emotional}} <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and effective methods of emotion elicitation. The main goal of the present study was to develop and test the effectiveness of a new and comprehensive set of emotional film excerpts. Fifty film experts were asked to remember specific film scenes that elicited fear, anger, sadness, disgust, amusement, tenderness, as well as emotionally neutral scenes. For each emotion, the 10 most frequently mentioned scenes were selected and cut into <b>film</b> <b>clips.</b> Next, 364 participants viewed the <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> in individual laboratory sessions and rated each film on multiple dimensions. Results showed that the <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> were effective with regard to several criteria such as emotional discreteness, arousal, positive and negative affect. Finally, ranking scores were computed for 24 classification criteria: Subjective arousal, positive and negative affect (derived from the PANAS; Watson & Tellegen, 1988), a positive and a negative affect scores derived from the Differential Emotions Scale (DES; Izard et al., 1974), six emotional discreteness scores (for anger, disgust, sadness, fear, amusement and tenderness), and 15 “mixed feelings” scores assessing the effectiveness of each film excerpt to produce blends of specific emotions. In addition, a number of emotionally neutral <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> were also validated. The database and editing instructions to construct the <b>film</b> <b>clips</b> have been made freely available in a website...|$|R

500|$|Every song on Station to Station {{eventually}} {{appeared on}} a single. [...] "Golden Years" [...] was released in November 1975, {{two months before the}} album. Bowie allegedly got drunk to perform it on TV for the American show Soul Train, resulting in the <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> seen on music video programmes. It reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 10 in the US (where it charted for sixteen weeks) but, like [...] "Rebel Rebel"'s relationship to Diamond Dogs (1974), was a somewhat unrepresentative teaser for the album to come.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{performed}} [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] {{throughout his}} 1974 North American tour, utilising a funk-inspired arrangement that featured musicians Willie Weeks, Andy Newmark and Tom Scott. For these performances, Harrison modified {{the lyrics to}} reflect the former Beatles uniting against manager Allen Klein. The song's title was a phrase that Harrison and commentators adopted when referring to Beatles-related legal issues during the 1970s. A <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> containing Harrison's 1971 demo of [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] appeared on the DVD accompanying the 2006 remaster of Living in the Material World.|$|E

Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed; speculating in the May 1968 issue of Esquire {{on the content of}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, which had yet to air in America, Christgau wrote: [...] "But if Paul McCartney's work on the <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> of 'Hello Goodbye' is any indication, we would be wise not to hope for too much." ...|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was officially}} issued in September 2006, on the DVD {{included}} in the deluxe edition of Harrison's remastered 1973 solo album, Living in the Material World. The song is set to archival footage, showing images of Harrison's National resonator guitar, over which his handwritten lyrics are superimposed. In the opinion of Music Box editor John Metzger, this version of [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] "stings more than its studio counterpart". Although the 2006 reissue lists it as an [...] "acoustic demo version", Harrison played electric slide guitar on the recording.

500|$|Along {{with his}} {{description}} {{of it as a}} [...] "rolling filmic snapshot" [...] of Friar Park, Simon Leng views [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] as a [...] "musical companion piece" [...] to Feinstein's album cover image: [...] " [...] conjures an allegorical dream world, populated by smirking gnomes... a disembodied Victorian lawyer, and, in George Harrison, a refugee from the world's attention." [...] Leng sees Harrison's 1976 <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> for [...] "Crackerbox Palace" [...] as [...] "the celluloid realization of the 'Let it Roll' script". Scott Janovitz likewise views the track as [...] "a tour of the grounds" [...] while praising its [...] "darkly beautiful" [...] melody. [...] "Like no other Harrison song," [...] Janovitz adds, [...] "'The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp' offers a glimpse of the true George Harrison – at once mystical, humorous, solitary, playful, and serious." ...|$|E

She also appeared in films that starred Jean Harlow and Ramon Navarro and was a stand-in for Lili Damita. [...] Her trained voice made her valuable during this dawn of the talking pictures era, and {{she worked as a}} voice actor in animated cartoons, sometimes doing the parts of speaking cats and dogs. [...] She appeared in a promotional <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> with Buster, MGM's star dog.

500|$|Ringo's Rotogravure {{was issued}} on 17 September 1976 in Britain and {{ten days later}} in the United States, with [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] sequenced as the second track on side two of the LP. The US release coincided with {{heightened}} speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} Beatles reunion, following promoter Sid Bernstein's offer of $230 million for a single concert by the group. While Starr was often asked about his former bandmates' contributions to the album, he was frustrated by the media's preference for discussing the Beatles. Starr also dismissed the idea that Harrison's non-appearance on [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] was to avoid Rotogravure being seen as a work by [...] "The New Beatles'", as one interviewer had suggested. Although it was not selected for release as a single, Starr made a promotional film for the song, along with two other tracks from the album.

500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More <b>film</b> <b>clip</b> montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
