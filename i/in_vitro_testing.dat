25|$|Purpureocillium lilacinum {{was first}} {{observed}} {{in association with}} nematode eggs in 1966 and the fungus was subsequently found parasitising the eggs of Meloidogyne incognita in Peru. It has now been isolated from many cyst and root-knot nematodes and from soil in many locations. Several successful field trials using P.lilacinum against pest nematodes were conducted in Peru. The Peruvian isolate was then sent to nematologists in 46 countries for testing, {{as part of the}} International Meloidogyne project, resulting in many more field trials on a range of crops in many soil types and climates. Field trials, glasshouse trials and <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>testing</b> of P.lilacinum continues and more isolates have been collected from soil, nematodes and occasionally from insects. Isolates vary in their pathogenicity to plant-parasitic nematodes. Some isolates are aggressive parasites while other, though morphologically indistinguishable, are less or non-pathogenic. Sometimes isolates that looked promising in vitro or in glasshouse trials have failed to provide control in the field.|$|E

Vane and Piper tested the biochemical cascade associated with anaphylactic shock (in extracts from guinea pig lungs, applied to tissue from rabbit aortas). They found that aspirin inhibited the release of an unidentified chemical generated by guinea pig lungs, a chemical that caused rabbit tissue to contract. By 1971, Vane identified the chemical (which they called [...] "rabbit-aorta contracting substance," [...] or RCS) as a prostaglandin. In a 23 June 1971 paper in the journal Nature, Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs (the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins. Later research showed that NSAIDs such as aspirin worked by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for converting arachidonic acid into a prostaglandin.|$|E

2500|$|Physicians have {{described}} the successful use {{of a variety of}} discontinued antiprotozoals in treatment of Blastocystis infection. [...] Emetine was reported as successful in cases in early 20th century with British soldiers who contracted Blastocystis infection while serving in Egypt. [...] <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>testing</b> showed emetine was more effective than metronidazole or furazolidone. Emetine is available in the United States through special arrangement with the Center for Disease Control. Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections. [...] For example, in Australia, production of diloxanide furoate ended in 2003, paromomycin is available under special access provisions, and the availability of iodoquinol is limited.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} fertilizing {{potential of}} frozen-thawed semen from four black and four white boars was determined following heterospermic insemination. A heterospermic index (HI) was computed {{for each of}} the 16 pairs of black and white boars, as the percentage of offspring sired by the black boar minus the percentage of offspring sired by the white boar. Correlation coefficients were computed between the HI and the differences (black boar minus white boar) <b>in</b> several <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>tests</b> of seminal quality before and after cryopreservation of the semen. For the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>tests</b> before cryopreservation, the HI were negatively correlated (- 0. 57, P 0. 05) with the differences in spermatozoan motility after cooling to 5 (DEGREES) C.

The HI were correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the differences in the following <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>tests</b> after freezing and thawing: spermatozoan motility (0. 50), spermatozoa with either normal or damaged apical ridges (0. 31), spermatozoa with missing apical ridges (- 0. 51), spermatozoa filtered through sephadex columns (0. 32), spermatozoa with acrosin-activity (0. 38), percentage of maximum releasable GOT (0. 54), spermatozoan intracellular GOT (- 0. 57), spermatozoa bound per zona-free hamster oocyte (0. 64) and, percentage of zona-free hamster oocytes penetrated (0. 75).
