6000|$|... "There's one thing," [...] said Billie complacently, eyeing <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> {{the mirror}} of her vanity-case, [...] "I may glitter in the fighting-top, but it is genuine. When I was a kid, I was a regular little tow-head." ...|$|E
60|$|She rose, {{folded her}} gloves {{into a ball}} and her veil over her hat, and once more faced <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> her mother's looking-glass. I had not the courage to tell her that the {{expression}} she wore on other occasions suited her best.|$|E

6000|$|It was a {{pleasant}} September afternoon, on possibly one of these occasions, that Miss Sally, sitting before the piano, alternately striking a few notes with three pink fingers and glancing at <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the polished rosewood surface of the lifted keyboard case, was heard to utter this languid protest:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The Patchwork Girl, quickly {{recovering}} from her fright, now came nearer and looked {{from one to}} another of the people with deep interest. Then she looked at herself and laughed.

Then, addressing <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the glass, she exclaimed: ...|$|E

The {{sword of}} {{sharpness}} given to Perseus by Hermes, {{with which he}} cut off {{the head of the}} Gorgon Medusa, a monster with the head of a woman, and snaky locks, the sight of whom turned those who looked on her into stone.

6000|$|... "What in {{the world}} are they after?" [...] she asked of <b>her</b> own <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the little looking-glass which hung there.

50|$|Back in Africa, Nelly is seen {{singing a}} {{beautiful}} love song, <b>her</b> sad <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a pond, tears dripping from her eyes, {{and from the}} eyes of her jungle friends.

50|$|Uzume {{had hung}} a bronze mirror and a {{beautiful}} jewel of polished jade. Amaterasu heard them, and peered out to see {{what all the fuss}} was about.

6000|$|... "I was, of course, when I was a girl," [...] she said, bending {{her head}} over the clear water to catch <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> it; [...] "but now I've {{forgotten}} all such foolish things as magic.

60|$|The {{girls at}} once obeyed, for they greatly feared the Red Rogue; {{and of course}} they descended the front {{stairway}} and walked through the great hall. At once the large mirror that had been exposed to view caught the eye of Seseley, and she paused to regard <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the glass. Her two companions did likewise, and instantly all three girls became invisible, while the mirror held their reflections fast in its magic surface.|$|E
60|$|She seated herself {{before her}} mirror and {{critically}} examined <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the glass. She {{knew she was}} good-looking. No need of a mirror to tell her that. Her youth and her good looks had been her stock in trade, and yet this evening she appraised her features most critically, and as with light fingers she touched her hair, now {{in one place and}} now in another, she found herself humming a gay little tune and she realized that she was very happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a curious}} evening," [...] {{she said aloud}} to herself, {{speaking}} in a low full voice. [...] "I have not seen one like it since mother died, and that is seven years ago.

6000|$|... "Oh, women! Piff! I do {{not care}} for women; they are very unkind to me, because--because--well, perhaps you can guess why, Macumazahn," [...] she answered, glancing at <b>her</b> own <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a little {{travelling}} looking-glass that hung from the woodwork of the wagon, for I had been using it to brush my hair, and smiled very sweetly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two friends}} then embrace, and begin kissing passionately. Releasing these long-repressed {{emotions}} begins Rita's transformation into a vampire, {{and just as}} she is ready to bite the unsuspecting Justice in the neck, she sees <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> disappearing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bedroom mirror - {{a sure sign that}} she is transforming into one of the [...] "undead". Horrified, she races to Max's apartment to confront him about the changes occurring in her.|$|R
6000|$|The {{feeling of}} guilt as of having robbed the bank with which she left Stratford Place happily wore off in time; and when the grey dress was finished, and she found herself arrayed becomingly, the result made her happy for a season. She {{surveyed}} <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the tall pier-glass in her bedroom with strange interest--or not strange, perhaps--and thought with a little feeling of triumph that the grand lady and her daughters would not feel disgusted at their dimness of vision if they once more mistook her for their friend [...] "Miss Featherstonehaugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 108: The gorgon, Medusa, changed {{every one}} who saw her to stone. Perseus avoided the penalty by only looking at <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a mirror as he {{cut off her}} head while she slept. Being the {{grandson}} of a king of Argos he was an Argive hero, whence his triumph was engraved upon the royal goblet. The artist had selected the moment when Perseus is darting into {{the air with the}} head of the gorgon, which, newly separated from the body, still retained the traces of expiring life.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes all}} sorts of people to make a world, as I've often heard, but I think there are some who could be spared," [...] Anne told <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the east gable mirror that night. [...] "I wouldn't have {{mentioned}} the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT score. I really don't know who or what is to be thanked for this. I did nothing to bring it about, and it's hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Meara wrote <b>her</b> {{personal}} life <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> a New York-focused online blog, Mr. Beller's Neighborhood -- New York City Stories. In it, Meara recalled her mother's death and her childhood experiences at Catholic boarding school.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with her}} other {{responsibilities}} related to her company, Heyman {{took the time to}} focus on wedding photography as a personal project. This project developed from her work documenting family life and <b>her</b> <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> deciding to marry a second time. In attending over 200 weddings by the age of 44, Heyman discovered that every wedding has its own story. She sought to find this story, along with the reasoning as to why people get married. Heyman fully immersed herself into her photography sessions at weddings by not only acting like a guest with a camera, but by engaging with the couples through questions. She also photographed weddings because there was something in her own weddings that remained unresolved. Going to other people's weddings with a camera has put her in touch with her personal drama, too.|$|R
