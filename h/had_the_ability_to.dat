5|$|After leaving City, Trautmann played, for a month, for Wellington Town, {{who offered}} him £50 per match, signing in September 1964 to replace an injured regular keeper. Age had diminished his abilities, but his debut at Hereford showed he still <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> draw crowds. However, {{he was sent}} off at Tonbridge for violent conduct in his second match, and never played again. For Wellington, he had saved two matches and been on losing side in five.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned {{to this type}} of feeding.|$|E

50|$|Deathwatch is {{a native}} of an alien demonic {{dimension}} and so derived at least some of his superhuman powers from his non-human heritage. Deathwatch <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> absorb life from another creature that is experiencing pain or death and enhance his own health, strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> physically penetrate a victim's body and disrupt internal organs without creating a surface wound. He also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> absorb and access a victim's short-term memories by penetrating the victim's brain physically with his fingers, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> derive surges of physical and emotional pleasure from the proximity of death.|$|R
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating the style of a music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy. The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the music itself <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|Laing, who {{was charged}} with maleficium, confessed she had made spells with buckets of water and burning coals as well as {{stabbing}} needles into a wax model of her intended victim. She met the Devil {{in the form of}} a black dog on Ceres Moor and made a bargain with him; she knew he was the Devil as he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change shape and had undergone a transformation in front of her. Initially she offered him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E
5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying. However, she performed well at school, ranking amongst the top five in her class at Yapenka Elementary School in South Jakarta. She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} as a very feminine child, enjoying dresses and make-up. While in elementary school she began singing along with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> be a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and sing in public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E

5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued {{to attract the attention}} of historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The 1844 Railway act of England {{compelled}} {{at least}} one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile. Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> travel to other towns frequently. Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards. The British constructed a vast railway network in India, but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose {{in addition to the}} commercial purpose. The efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|The Turk also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{converse}} with spectators using a letter board. The director, whose identity {{during the period}} when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, {{was able to do}} this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.|$|E

It originally <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} the Viet Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region. It {{was the first time}} the Viet Cong launched a large-scale operation, holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor, artillery and helicopters, and aided by U.S. air support and military advisers. The Viet Cong demonstrated that, when well-supplied with military supplies from North Vietnam, they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fight and inflict damage even on the best ARVN units.|$|E

5|$|The work of Thirty Seconds to Mars {{generated}} {{the interest of}} record producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including The Wall by Pink Floyd, Love It to Death by Alice Cooper, and Destroyer by Kiss. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they felt that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper. Brian Virtue, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction, joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.|$|E
5|$|There were {{disk drive}} {{interfaces}}, {{such as the}} Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/Kempston KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces {{were the first to}} come bundled with office productivity software (Tasword Word Processor, Masterfile database and Omnicalc spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
