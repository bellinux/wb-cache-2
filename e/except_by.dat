5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S.

Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, <b>except</b> <b>by</b> a fluke.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{counted as}} one of the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain, it seems that after the Romans left Britain in 410 Durovernum Cantiacorum was {{abandoned}} <b>except</b> <b>by</b> a few farmers and gradually decayed. Over the next 100years, an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls, as Jutish refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals. In 597, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert its King Æthelberht to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, being a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his episcopal see in Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint. In 672, the Synod of Hertford gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church.|$|E
5|$|Junior synonym: A name which {{describes}} the same taxon as a previously published name. If {{two or more}} genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, {{the first to be}} published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, <b>except</b> <b>by</b> special decision of the ICZN (see Tyrannosaurus), but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, <b>except</b> <b>by</b> sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done.

5|$|Roger was {{the eldest}} brother of William, but died childless during their father's lifetime. The next son, John, {{inherited}} the family lands, but died around 1149 without children. William then inherited the lands. John and William had a sister called Margaret, {{who was the}} wife of Haimo de St Clair. Their father married a second time, and had a son named Simon by that marriage. William took his surname from his mother's family, as did his half-brother Simon, who {{was not related to}} the Chesney family <b>except</b> <b>by</b> marriage. Two further children of Robert's, Elias and Peter, are known, but whether they were the children of the first marriage or the second is unclear. Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved <b>except</b> <b>by</b> death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|The Chocobo {{series is}} a {{collection}} of video games published by Square, and later by Square Enix, featuring a recurring creature from the Final Fantasy series, the Chocobo, as the protagonist. The creature is a large and normally flightless bird which first appeared in Final Fantasy II and has been featured in almost all subsequent Final Fantasy games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. The Chocobo series of video games contains over 20 titles for video game consoles, mobile phones, and online platforms. These games include installments of the Mystery Dungeon series of roguelike video games, racing games, adventure games, and minigame collections. Although the various games of the series have different game styles and are generally unrelated <b>except</b> <b>by</b> their inclusion of a Chocobo as the main character, Square Enix considers them to be a distinct series.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country <b>except</b> <b>by</b> land. The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the pelagic {{stingray}} consists of free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{is an active}} hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and {{has been known to}} take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short gestation period of 24 months, females may bear two litters of 413 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the equator, {{with the exception of the}} Mediterranean Sea, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered <b>except</b> <b>by</b> fishery workers, the {{pelagic stingray}} can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks). Along with the pelagic stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as of Least Concern.|$|E
