However, an extensive European review demonstrated that in practice {{this is not always}} true. This study aims to compare the status of soil and water properties between separate fields managed in either an organic or a conventional manner. Soil samples were collected from 16 pairs of farms, throughout England, with both arable and grass fields within each pair on similar soil type. Chemical (nutrients, pesticides, herbicides) and physical (aggregate stability, field capacity, shear strength, soil organic matter, infiltration rates) soil properties were measured in four main soil texture classes in organic and conventional fields. The physical soil properties varied significantly between the different classes of texture and land use. The heavier textured soils have significantly higher soil organic carbon (SOC),aggregate stability and shear strength. The coarse-textured soils have significantly lower <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>moisture</b> contents. The grassland has a significantly higher level of SOC, <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>moisture</b> content, aggregate stability and soil shear strength.

There were fewer traces of agrochemicals in the soil water from the organic fields compared with the conventionally managed fields. The conventional arable fields had higher levels of total inorganic nitrogen than the other land uses and treatments. There was evidence to show that infiltration rates were significantly higher on organically managed grassland soils (7. 6 mm⁄ h) than conventionally managed grassland (2. 5 mm⁄ h) with lower stocking rates.

Two levels of water content (80 %– 85 % and 45 %– 50 % of <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity)</b> were used in a randomized complete block design with four replications. We measured 13 morphological and physiological characters such as plant height, branch numbers, biomass, leaf water content and photosynthetic pigment content in seedling and pod-pin stages. Important findings The 29 peanut cultivars can divided into four classes: high-, mid- and low-tolerant cultivars and intolerant cultivars. The high-tolerant cultivars included ‘Tangke 8 ’, ‘Jihua 2 ’, ‘Datangyou’, ‘Huayu 25 ’, ‘Huayu 17 ’, ‘Luhua 14 ’ and ‘Fenghua 1 ’. Subordinate function values of the morphological indexes including main stem height, branch number and biomass, and photosynthetic pigments contents of the same cultivars at seedling stage were different. In addition, the subordinate function value of the seedling stage was unrelated to drought resistance, so a single physiological index cannot be used to identify the drought resistance of peanut. But the values drought resistance comprehensive evaluation (D) of physiological indexes were significantly related to drought resistance and can be used to identify the drought resistance of peanut. At the pod-pin stage, the D values of morphological indexes and physiological indexes were both significantly related to drought resistance, so the subordinate function value and D value of morphological indexes and physiological indexes at this stage can serve as indexes for identifying peanut drought resistance...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} and vegetation growth {{are the most}} direct and important indicators of drought events and, therefore, an understanding of vegetation and soil spectral behavior {{is critical to the}} drought estimation. Recently, Ghulam et al. [Ghulam, A., Qin, Q., Zhan, Z., 2006. Designing of the perpendicular drought index. Environmental Geology, doi: 10. 1 007 /sOO 254 - 006 - 0544 - 2 (accessed March 8, 2007). ] established the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) that is based on an extensive analysis of spatial distribution features of soil moisture in NIR-Red spectral space. In this paper, an improved drought monitoring method, the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), is developed introducing vegetation fraction, which takes into account both soil {{moisture and}} vegetation growth. To validate the drought indices proposed by this paper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images from different times registered over different eco-systems with various drought conditions are used to calculate the PDI and MPDI over ground measuring points. The PDI and MPDI are then compared to an in-situ drought index obtained from field measurements made synchronously with the satellite overpass, including the bulk soil moisture content at different soil depths, <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity,</b> wilting coefficient, etc. It is evident from the results that the PDI and the MPDI is highly accordant with in-situ drought values with the highest correlation (R- 2 = 0. 8134) found between the MPDI and an in-situ drought index derived from 0 - 20 cm mean soil moisture. This study concludes that the PDI and the MPDI provide quite similar results for bare soil surfaces, especially {{in the early stages of}} vegetation growth. However, the MPDI demonstrates a much better performance in measuring vegetated surfaces since it takes into account both soil moisture and vegetation growth in the modeling process. The MPDI has the potential to provide a simple and real-time drought monitoring method in the remote estimation of drought phenomena.

The aim of this paper was to compare the effectiveness of the extractors Mehlich- 1, Anionic Resin (AR) and Mixed Resin (MR), to determine the availability of P under different experimental conditions. The laboratory study was arranged in randomized blocks in a &# 91;(3 x 3 x 2) + 3 &# 93; x 4 factorial design, with four replications, testing the response of three soils with different texture: a very clayey Red Latosol (LV), a sandy clay loam Red Yellow Latosol (LVA), and a sandy loam Yellow Latosol (LA), to three sources (triple superphosphate, reactive phosphate rock from Gafsa-Tunisia; and natural phosphate from Araxá-Minas Gerais) at two P rates (75 and 150 mg dm- 3), plus three control treatments (each soil without P application) after four contact periods (15, 30, 60, and 120 days) of the P sources with soil. The soil acidity of LV and LVA was adjusted by raising base saturation to 60 % with the application of CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 at a 4 : 1 molar ratio (LA required no correction). These samples were maintained at <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity</b> for 30 days.

Of the three sources, this reduction was most pronounced for triple superphosphate, intermediate for reactive phosphate, while Araxá phosphate was least sensitive to the effect of time. It was observed that AR extracted lower P levels from all three soils when the sources were phosphate rocks, while MR extracted values close to Mehlich- 1 in LV (clay) and LVA (medium texture) for reactive phosphate. For Araxá phosphate, much higher P values were determined by Mehlich- 1 than by the resins, because of the acidity of the extractor.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of fast growing tree species on arable land is {{deemed to be}} one of the most promising alternatives amongst the approaches to the {{cultivation of}} renewable resources currently available. As the site factors influencing the growth of poplar and willow have not yet been sufficiently identified and quantified, it is not possible to provide reliable national yield expectations as a function of the prevailing soil and climate conditions at a particular site on the basis of the data currently available. The main objective of this study, therefore, was to develop a supraregional site-based yield model for the assessment of yield expectations for poplar and willow grown on arable land over short rotations. In order to achieve this goal, a total of 38 research sites were established across as many regions of Germany as possible. The clones selected for the experiment were the poplar clones Max 1, Hybride 275 (H 275) and AF 2, and the willow clones Inger and Tordis. Each site was also characterised, on the basis of climate and soil data. From the site parameters recorded, variables were defined for modelling purposes. The climate variables comprised temperature (T), precipitation (N) and aridity index (TI) derived from total or average values from selected periods during the year and during the vegetation period. Within the variables the months were indexed as numbers (January = 1), periods were separated by comma. Parameters of the German soil appraisal such as the condition grade (ZS), the soil quality index value (BZ) and the arable land quality index value (AZ) were used as soil variables. The selected texture parameters were the proportions of sand (S[%]), silt (U[%]) and clay (T[%]). Variables of the pore space parameters were the available <b>field</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity</b> (nFK), the air capacity (LK) and the dry bulk density (TRD). Both the texture and the pore space variables referred to a soil depth of 0 to 60 cm. To increase the precision of the results, site clusters were derived, differentiated by main soil type, and the variables were aggregated. The dGZ, measured in odt ha- 1 a- 1,at the end of the first three-year rotation was chosen as the dependent variable. The main results of the study are outlined in the following: Negative correlations between dGZ and temperatures in the vegetation period, especially in the months July to September, were observed on the sandy and loamy soils. Precipitation variables always had a positive effect on the growth of poplar and willow across all clones and site clusters. Taking into consideration all experimental sites, precipitation in the period from May to July was most important. The parameters of the German soil appraisal revealed a moderate correlation with growth for all sites. From the appraisal of all sites and of the individual site clusters it became apparent that U[%] represents the most important texture variable for poplar and willow growth. Considered for all sites simultaneously, the nFK had the greatest significance for growth across all of the parameters examined. The site-based yield models were all univariate and often comprised aggregated variables. Under consideration of all sites, the model predictors for Max 1, Inger and Tordis were (nFK * TI 5. 7) and (nFK * N 5. 7) for AF 2. Each model was calculated with the inverse or sigmoid approach and revealed an R²korr between 0. 45 and 0. 64 with a RMSE of an average of 2. 0 odt ha- 1 a- 1. The division into site clusters improved the accuracy of the models considerably. In the sandy site cluster, the models exhibited an R²korr of 0. 77 to 0. 97 and an RMSE of 0. 95 to 1. 36 odt ha- 1 a- 1. These comprised (U[%]* N 6. 7) for Max 1 and F 2, (S[%]/ TI 6. 7) for H 275 and (S[%]* T 7. 8) for Inger and Tordis. For the silty site cluster, significant models could only be determined for the clones Max 1 and Tordis. The model predictor for Max 1 was (BZ * TI 4. 5) and for Tordis solely (BZ). The calculated R²korr values were 0. 84 and 0. 95 with a corresponding RMSE of 0. 22 and 0. 62 odt ha- 1 a- 1, respectively. For the loamy soils the models for Max 1 and Inger comprised the variable nFK, for AF 2 the variables (nFK * N 5. 6).

In order to better understand the effects of soil water content on mango yield and fruit quality at fruit growth stage, irrigation experiments were investigated and the object was to determine the soil water content criteria at which growth and quality of mango would be optimal based on soil water measured by RHD-JS water-saving irrigation system through micro-sprinkling irrigation. Five soil water content treatments (relative to the percentage of field water capacity) for irrigation (T 1 : 79 %- 82 %, T 2 : 75 %- 78 %, T 3 : 71 %- 74 %, T 4 : 65 %- 70 %, T 5 : 63 %- 66 %) were compared in 2013. Amount of applied irrigation water for different treatments varied from 2. 93 m 3 to 1. 08 m 3. The results showed that mango fruit production and quality at fruit growth stage were significantly affected under different irrigation water amounts. Variation in soil water content not only had effects on fruit size, but also on fruit yield. The highest fruit yield and irrigation water use efficiency were obtained from the T 4 treatment. Irrigation water amount also affected fruit quality parameters like fruit total soluble solids, soluble sugar, starch, titratable acid and vitamin C content. Comprehensive evaluation of the effect of indexs of correlation on irrigation treatment by subordinate function showed that when the soil moisture content were controlled at about 65 - 70 % of the <b>field</b> water <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity,</b> water demand in the growth and development of mango could be ensured, and maximum production efficiency of irrigation and the best quality of fruit could be achieved. In conclusion, treatment T 4 was the optimum irrigation schedule for growing mango, thus achieving efficient production of mango in consideration of the compromise among mango yield, fruit quality and water use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|For particleboards {{made with}} phenol-formaldehyde(PF) and isocyanate(IC) resins in {{addition}} to low-density particleboard (LDPB) and wood-lining board(WLB) used in the previous paper, equilibrium moisture content(EMC) curves at 15, 20,and 25 ℃ were　obtained as fundamental data to discuss the differences in bygroscopicity and <b>moisture</b> <b>capacities</b> among them. EMC curves at 20 ℃ were also obtained for the raw material　particles and binders, which were used to investigate the decline in hygroscopicity of particles by hot-pressing. The EMCs of PF-bonded boards were approximately 1 % {{higher than those of}} IC-bonded boards because of the notice able difference in EMCs between the binders. It was found that hygroscopicity of the particles was decreased approximately one-tenth by hot-pressing. For this reason {{in addition to}} the presence of binders, the EMCs of PF-and IC-bonded boards were about nine-tenths and eigth-tenths those of the law material particles, respectively. <b>Moisture</b> <b>capacities</b> of LDPB were almost equal to those of WLB because of the difference in densities of the two products. <b>Moisture</b> <b>capacities</b> of PF-and IC-bonded boards were estimated to be approximately four-fifths of those of solid wood with the same density.

However, wetting coverage in these Spodosols must be improved to increase soilborne pest and weed control. Field trials were carried out to determine the impact of soil moisture on the extent of wetting cross-sectional areas through varying irrigation times. Soil moisture contents were: a) 7 % <b>moisture</b> (<b>field</b> <b>capacity),</b> and b) 20 % (saturation), along with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h of irrigation. Pressed beds had 70 cm tops. Drip lines had emitters spaced 30 cm apart delivering 0. 056 L·min– 1 per m of row at 55 kPa, and two drip lines were buried at 2. 5 cm below the surface and 30 cm apart from each other. Water was mixed with a blue marking dye to analyze the water distribution patterns. Beds were opened at the emitters and high-resolution digital pictures were taken for each treatment. Resulting images were adjusted using photographic software and covered areas across the beds were determined. Regression analysis showed significant quadratic equations for both soil moisture situations, with saturated soils obtaining the highest cross section coverage (90 and 94 % after 8 and 10 h). In field capacity beds, the maximum cross section coverage obtained was 82 %. Within each soil moisture situation, there were no differences between 8 and 10 h of irrigation...|$|R

Weed composition is differentdifferent among management systems after 16 years. Areas with livestock showed much smaller number of weed species in comparison to systems where only grain crops are grown. The presence of livestock affects the potential of germination of soil seed bank. Agriculture systems are similar in terms of weed composition along soil profile, while systems involving livestock show little relation in what regards such sampled depths.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{occurrence}} of Ocotea pulchella in areas subjected to periodic flooding, this work aimed to evaluate the survival and initial development of Ocotea pulchella seedlings (2 months old) and juveniles (9 months old) in response to waterlogging under different light regimes by varying both light quantity and light quality, {{in order to test}} for possible flood tolerance of the species as affected by light conditions. Three levels of soil <b>moisture</b> (<b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> mean flooding - only for seedlings - and full flooding) and four light treatments (full sun, neutral shade, far red enriched shading and neutral plus far red) were tested. The survival of seedlings and juveniles during one year was relatively high, whereas growth was negatively affected by full sun and flooding. Seedling growth was inhibited by soil waterlogging whatever the light condition, whereas plant growth at field capacity and mean fl ooding was similar. Flooding also inhibited the growth of juveniles, and that response was practically not affected by the light regimes. The results suggest that Ocotea pulchella seedlings can survive in the understory, even in areas subject to fl ooding, forming a slow-growth seedling bank. The species seems to tolerate relatively long-term soil waterlogging when kept out of direct sunlight. Otherwise, responses of waterlogged plants to shading seem to be aff ected by irradiance and light quality...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} degradation causes, provoked by inappropriate agricultural practices that override the limitations of the soil physical properties. Preconsolidation pressure and penetration resistance have proved effective as alternative to assess and identify soil compaction. Based on the interpretation of these physico-mechanical parameters, compaction can be prevented with a better adjusted soil management. This study was performed to generate preconsolidation pressure and penetration resistance models for Latososlo Vermelho-Amarelo distr&# 243;fico (Oxisol) under various managements and uses; and evaluate which of these would lead to degradation or degradation susceptibility. The study was carried out in Curvelo, MG. Two managements and one land use were evaluated: no-tillage, sheep grazing and natural forest. Undisturbed soil samples collected from the 0 - 5 cm layer were subjected to uniaxial compression and penetration resistance tests. Preconsolidation pressure models for forest and no-tillage soils were not statistically different, demonstrating a low degradation potential in no-tillage systems. Preconsolidation pressure was higher in soil under sheep grazing at all water retention tensions and penetration resistance values were higher than under native forest indicating animal trampling as a potential degradation factor. Neither management presented penetration resistance values above 2 MPa at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>moisture.</b> Only under sheep grazing the soil penetrability was near 2 MPa at field capacity and values greater than 2 MPa at 0. 2 kg kg- 1...|$|R
