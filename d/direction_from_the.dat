5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid {{movement}} is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route8 (NY8) is a north-south {{state highway}} {{in the central}} part of New York in the United States. It runs in a southwest-to-northeast <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Southern Tier to the {{northern}} part of Lake George. The southern terminus of the route is at NY10 in the town of Deposit. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY9N in the town of Hague. Roughly midway between the two endpoints, NY8 passes through Utica, where it overlaps NY5, NY12, and Interstate790 (I-790) along one segment of the North–South Arterial.|$|E
5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed <b>direction</b> (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> earth's magnetic field or from the sky) to identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Turnpike is a , freeway-standard {{toll road}} that lies entirely within the U.S. state of Kansas. It {{runs in a}} general southwest–northeast <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma border to Kansas City.

The turnpike is owned and maintained by the Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA), which is headquartered in Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the Mk. I to III, various units had been flying the systems in an effort to develop suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the Chain Home (CH) sites talk to the fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CH stations towards real targets.|$|E

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Herzegovina, the KPJ {{had little}} impact until mid-August 1941, {{well after the}} initial revolt had been suppressed. During the lead-up to the mass uprising, the KPJ {{organisation}} in Herzegovina would not commit itself, as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in Sarajevo, which was expecting <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> KPJ Central Committee to launch a general uprising across Yugoslavia. Once they {{became aware of the}} German attack on the Soviet Union, the KPJ in Herzegovina voted to join the mass uprising, but this only occurred on 24 June, when the uprising was already in full swing. According to Milazzo, the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern Herzegovina well into July, although the uprising in Herzegovina did not advance until the Bosnia-wide revolt occurred at the end of July, by which time the KPJ was ready for active involvement in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the battlefield the Athenians had triumphed in a tough battle against the Thebans. The other Greeks fighting for the Persians had deliberately fought badly, according to Herodotus. The Thebans retreated from the battle, but in a different <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persians, allowing them to escape without further losses. The Greeks, reinforced by the contingents who had not taken part in the main battle, then stormed the Persian camp. Although the Persians initially defended the wall vigorously, it was eventually breached; the Persians, packed tightly together in the camp, were slaughtered by the Greeks. Of the Persians who had retreated to the camp, scarcely 3,000 were left alive.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the canal}} {{brought about a}} rapid {{development}} in coal mining on the Manchester Coalfield west of Worsley. Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit {{was connected to the}} canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canal at Boothstown to the pit. Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his Gin Pit Colliery to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The tramroad was later worked by locomotives. In 1867 the Fletchers built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from Howe Bridge onto barges. Astley Green Colliery began winding coal on the north bank of the canal in 1912. In the 1940s and '50s coal was sent to Barton Power Station and Runcorn Gas Works.|$|E
5|$|Nobuo Uematsu was {{the chief}} music {{composer}} of the Final Fantasy series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other composers include Masashi Hamauzu, Hitoshi Sakimoto and Junya Nakano. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring {{different areas of the}} game world. Once a game's major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game's main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game's scenario to determine the characters' personality. He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about. Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier titles; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until Final FantasyIV on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} lasted six months. It {{was mainly}} shot on a Los Angeles soundstage, but some second unit shooting {{was done in}} San Francisco, California. The film's many rooftop sequences were shot on the soundstage, with exteriors of San Francisco later greenscreened in. A behind-the-scenes feature shows {{that some of the}} roof scenes were shot in August 2002. The film employed over 400 people, and Wiseau is credited as an actor, an executive producer, the writer, producer, and director. Two others, Chloe Lietzke and Drew Caffrey, are credited as executive producers, but according to Sestero, Lietzke had no involvement in the film and Caffrey had died years prior to filming. Wiseau had a number of problems with his behind-the-camera team, and replaced the entire crew twice, though he later said that they were replaced four times. Some people had multiple jobs on the film; for example, in addition to playing the role of Mark, Sestero also worked as a line producer, assistant to Tommy Wiseau, and helped with casting. Wiseau frequently forgot his own lines or missed cues, requiring numerous retakes and on-set <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> script supervisor; as a result, much of his dialogue had to be re-dubbed in post production.|$|E
