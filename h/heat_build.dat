50|$|Hydraulic {{disc brakes}} use rotors {{attached}} to the hubs with hydraulically operated brake mechanisms that force ceramic pads against the rotors to effect braking. Advantages include high braking power and reliability. Disadvantages include cost, vulnerability of the discs, <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up, and weight.|$|E

Bowe exposed González for his {{limitations}} {{and lack of}} development, savagely pounding the Cuban before knocking him clean out in the 6th round.|$|R
50|$|Most new {{mountain}} bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, {{because they are}} located {{at the center of}} the wheel (on the wheel hub). They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged. The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Well set up V brakes or older cantilever set-ups, under normal road conditions can be equally, if not more effective in stopping power. Disc brakes do not allow <b>heat</b> to <b>build</b> up in the tires on long descents. Instead, <b>heat</b> <b>builds</b> up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.|$|R
5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. <b>Heat</b> <b>builds</b> up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expression}} a [...] "run bearing" [...] also {{derives from}} {{this style of}} bearing, since failure of lubrication will lead to <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up due to friction in the bearing, eventually leading to the bearing metal liquefying and {{running out of the}} pillow block.|$|E
50|$|In general terms, {{it is best}} to use {{the lowest}} {{practical}} frequency and a low power density when undertaking shrink fitting as this will generally provide more evenly distributed heat. The exception to this rule is when using heat to remove parts from shafts. In these cases it is often best to shock the component with a rapid heat, this also has the advantage of shortening the time cycle and preventing <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up in the shaft which can lead to problems with both parts expanding.|$|E
50|$|Tread lugs often feature slits—sipes—that {{improve the}} {{flexibility}} of the lug to deform as it traverses the footprint area. This reduces shear stress in the lug and reduces <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up. Testing of identical siped and unsiped tires showed measurable improvements in snow traction and ice braking performance, however diminishing and extending braking distances on wet and dry pavement by a few feet on siped tires. Off-road tire enthusiasts have been siping tires for years for greater traction, as many manufacturers now offer already siped off-road-tires.|$|E

5000|$|Some racing series such as Formula One {{allow an}} {{intermediate}} (inter) tyre. This tyre {{is designed to}} be used in conditions too wet for slick tyres and too dry for wet tyres. They are made with rubber compounds slightly softer than slick tyres and are cut with grooves like the rain tyre but shallower to prevent excessive <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up. Former Formula One tyre supplier Bridgestone referred to the [...] "intermediate" [...] tyre as the [...] "wet" [...] tyre, and to what are known as [...] "full wets" [...] as [...] "monsoon tyres".|$|E
50|$|The {{well known}} problem of pulled {{cylinder}} head studs with the K-Jetronic 2.7 engine only occurred in hot climates. This emerged in 1975 in California where thermal reactors, {{aimed at reducing}} emissions, were fitted below the cylinder heads thus causing <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up around the magnesium crankcase and then made worse by the lean running K-Jetronic CIS. The fitting of a 5-blade engine fan {{instead of the usual}} 11-blade further compounded the situation.Bearing in mind Porsche's largest market being the USA, the 930 Turbo, Carrera 3.0 and all subsequent models used aluminium alloy crankcases which were around 15 lb heavier.|$|E
50|$|Radar {{absorbing}} {{structures and}} radome, body conformal antennae surface hard aperture, flush air data sensors and frequency selective surface (FSS) radome {{are used to}} reduce radar detection. Stealth ability is enhanced {{by the use of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) during the construction of the airframe and in the airframe and instruments. AMCA's design prevents detection of the aircraft from L band, C band and X band radars. The aircraft's thrust vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up from supersonic flight.|$|E
5000|$|Every summer, intense <b>heat</b> <b>builds</b> {{starting}} in the Pilbara district of Western Australia around October/November and spreading widely over the tropical and subtropical inland parts of the continent by January. In the summer months, {{the southern part of}} the continent straddles the westerly wind belt to the south and the subtropical high-pressure ridge to the north. The intense heat buildup occurs where high pressure is highly dominant in the upper levels of the atmosphere over the tropics and subtropics of Australia in summer allowing for a huge area of stable atmospheric conditions to predominate.|$|R

50|$|In June 1995, after a <b>heated</b> <b>build</b> up, Bowe {{defended the}} WBO heavyweight title against his archrival in the amateurs, Jorge Luis González, At the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The prefight hype {{contained}} bizarre trash talk, which included Gonzalez declaring {{a desire to}} eat Bowe's heart and likening himself to a lion which making Bowe {{out to be a}} hyena. Bowe won by sixth-round knockout over Gonzalez. He vacated the WBO championship soon after.After the Gonzales fight, Bowe fought a rubbermatch with Evander Holyfield, their third and final meeting. Holyfield knocked Bowe down during the fight, but Bowe maintained his composure, and persevered to score an eighth round stoppage victory.|$|R
5000|$|Compact {{fluorescent}} lamps (CFL) {{have been used}} more frequently as time has improved the quality of these lamps. These lamps have been used on municipal walkways and street lighting though they are still rare at this time. Improvements in reliability {{still need to be}} made. Some issues with them are limited lumen output, high <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up in the self-contained ballast, low life/burnout due to frequent cycling (on/off) of the lamp, and the problem where most fluorescent sources become dimmer in cold weather (or fail to start at all). CFL efficiency is high and CRI is excellent around 85. CFL produces a color temperature around 3000 K with its light being [...] "soft white" [...] around that color temperature. Higher color temperatures are available.|$|E
50|$|A {{much more}} {{accurate}} way of notching {{the end of}} tube stock {{is to use a}} specially made milling cutter called an end mill. The stock to be notched is clamped into a vise and can then be fed slowly and accurately into a rotating, hardened metal, end mill. The equipment required for this method is considerably more expensive than the hole saw method and does not lend well to the same portability of the hole saw method as the machine is usually bolted to the floor for stability and safety reasons. This method of end notching is much faster and thus greatly minimizes the chance of damaging the stock either by warping due to <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up or by squashing as can still happen with a hole saw.|$|E
5000|$|During {{a fire in}} a tunnel, {{as well as in}} the {{petrochemical}} industry, temperatures exceed {{those of}} ordinary building (cellulosic) fires. This is because the fuel for the fire is hydrocarbons, which burn hotter (compare hydrocarbon curve above to ASTM E119 curve), faster and typically run out of fuel faster as well, compared against timber. The added complication with tunnels is that the environment inside a [...] "tube" [...] is best described as a [...] "microclimate". The heat cannot escape as well as it can in a burning refinery, which is in the open. Instead, the fire is confined to a narrow tube, where pressure and <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up and spread rapidly, with little room for escape and little chance of compartmentalization. This scenario was tested and quantified, particularly during the [...] "Eureka Project", run by Technische Universität Braunschweig's iBMB, Ekkehard Richter. The Netherlands, through Rijkswaterstaat in particular, mandated an extremely tough standard, the curve of which is shown in the gallery above.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} problem, of special concern in {{military}} applications, which often involve sustained firing, is the heat {{sensitivity of the}} ammunition. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern gunpowder, ignites at a relatively low temperature of around 170 °C (338 °F). One of {{the functions of the}} metallic cartridge case is as a heat sink; when extracted after firing, every metallic case carries away a significant amount of the heat from the combustion of the propellant, slowing the rate at which <b>heat</b> <b>builds</b> up in the chamber. The thermal insulation provided by the case also works the other way around, shielding the propellant from built-up heat in the chamber walls.|$|R
50|$|After some {{modification}} in {{the heat}} during the past week over the midwest and northeast, the jet once again moved further north into Canada allowing intense <b>heat</b> to <b>build</b> across eastern North America. On July 15, Temperatures reached 109 F in Pierre, South Dakota.|$|R
50|$|When {{considering}} {{scaling up}} {{a reaction to}} large scale from lab scale, {{it is important to}} understand how much heat is released. At a small scale heat released may not cause a concern, however when scaling up, that <b>heat</b> can <b>build</b> up and be extremely dangerous.|$|R
5000|$|Grinding {{wheels are}} {{cylinders}} that are rotated at high speed. While once {{worked with a}} foot pedal or hand crank, the introduction of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater radial stress to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with cutting wheels which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary {{the use of a}} lubricant of some kind. Traditionally they were called coolants as they were used to prevent frictional <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the temper of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing [...] "thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation".|$|E
50|$|The car {{suffered}} {{yet another}} suspension failure during practice and a DNF {{due to a}} burnt out coil in Heat 1 of Round 2 of the championship at the Adelaide International Raceway. The burnt out coil {{was the result of}} its position on top of the Cosworth engine. The cars had been held on the grid for long time while the back markers took up their positions, and the <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up was enough to cook the coil only 4 laps into the race when Romano held a 3-second lead over the Kaditcha Chevrolet of Peter Hopwood. On just the 3rd lap, Romano broke Garrie Cooper's Sports Car lap record at AIR of 52.2 (set in his self-designed Elfin MR7 Chevrolet), lowering it to 51.67, a record that still stands for the 1.6 to 3 litres category as of 2016. The coil was replaced in time for Heat 2 where Romano and the car scored their first win, coming home 5.5 seconds in front of eventual series champion Hopwood.|$|E
5000|$|The nest of O. bicornis {{consists}} of an array of partitioned cylindrical cells in holes in wood or reed tubes. These bees accept a diverse range of pre-existing cavities as nest sites. The cells are arranged linearly within a narrow tube. If the internal diameter of the tube exceeds 12 mm, then this linear arrangement may be forced into two rows instead of one. The length of each cell can vary from 10 to 21 mm. The inner sides of the partitions are rough and convex, while the outer sides are smooth and concave. Between the cells and the terminal plug is a space known as the [...] The vestibule acts {{as a form of}} protection against volatile environmental conditions. The bees whose nests are exposed to the sun and <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> vestibules more frequently. The material used to build the nests is mud mixed with their mandibles, but the sides of the tunnel in which the nests are located are usually not lined with mud, with the exception of some irregularly arranged nests. Females construct around six cells per nest on average; however, larger females construct more cells than smaller ones. When it is time for females to lay their eggs, they add pollen to each brood cell and lay one egg in each cell next to the pollen. The sequence of nesting behavior is: cell construction, provisioning, egg-laying, and sealing the cell.Cells containing females are typically larger than those containing males, due to the sexual dimorphism of the species. Additionally, cells containing females are situated towards the back of the nest, while those with males are closer to the nest entrance. Because of this, male offspring leave the nest sooner than females. Due to the linear arrangement of cells in the nest, the youngest bee leaves earlier than older ones.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper through a shear test on a fully {{saturated}} granular medium, simulated by the discrete element method, {{the effect of the}} heat produced by friction on the internal pore water pressure is explored. It is found that the dissipated energy is enough to increase the pore pressure and reduce the soil strength. In adiabatic and impermeable conditions the <b>heat</b> <b>builds</b> up quickly inside the shear band, and the softening is more pronounced. It is found as well that for real geological materials, heat conduction is not enough to reduce the pore pressure, and the softening prevails. Nevertheless, it is observed that the hydraulic conduction may mitigate or completely eliminate the temperature growth inside the shear band. This result provides new understanding on the thermodynamic factors involved in the onset of catastrophic landslides...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of heating two concrete types and profiles to evaluate the most effective material during diurnal heating and cooling cycles. Plain and finned concrete slabs were manufactured from concrete with a 100 % - PC binder (CEM 1) and a binder using 50 % - PC and 50 % GGBS (CEM 111). The slabs were subject to mainly radiative heat for a 7. 5 hour daytime period and left to cool for 16. 5 hours. Comparative readings were taken to measure the temperature {{difference between the two}} types of concrete during heating and cooling. The findings showed concrete manufactured with GGBS had a lower <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up and release when compared to concrete manufactured with 100 % CEM 1 binder. The research was limited to one comparative test at a single concrete strength with a single water cement ratio, and 50 % GGBS cement replacement. Various GGBS cement replacement percentages could be tried to evaluate <b>heat</b> <b>build</b> up and release. Further research on U and Y values are also worthy of further investigation. Thermal mass could be improved thus reducing the need to use energy intensive air conditioning systems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{satellite}} observations of plasma density enhancements (ducts) in thetopside ionosphere during four HAARP/BRIOCHE campaigns during 2009 – 2010. Artificial ducts, caused by high-power HF radio wave injections from the HAARPtransmitter toward the magnetic zenith, are detected by the DEMETER and DMSPsatellites {{on a regular}} basis when there is a perceptible ionospheric F 2 peak density. Overall, the plasma density enhancements detected between 0930 and 1230 LT varied from 3 – 13 %, while those during 1730 – 2215 LT were typically 15 – 40 %. We also used amodified SAMI 2 model to study the artificial ducts’ mechanism driven by HF electronheating in the bottomside F 2 region. The <b>heating</b> <b>builds</b> up the plasma pressure, thuspushing plasma along the magnetic field.
