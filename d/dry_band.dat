5000|$|The ADSS {{cable is}} {{suspended}} in the electrical field due to the phase conductors; this varies from a maximum at mid-span to zero at the grounded metal supports of the cable. In dry conditions, no current flows on the jacket of the cable, but moisture reduces the jacket insulation. Uneven distribution of moisture can result in formation of high-resistance [...] "dry bands" [...] which have a relatively high voltage across them. Dry bands tend to form at the supports. Voltage across the <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> can cause carbon tracks to form and erosion of the jacket material. If the voltage across the <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> is high enough, an arc may form which can damage the jacket. Dry-band arcing is more likely for cables installed under higher transmission voltage lines (220 kV and above). Even a few incidents of arcing along a <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> can cause severe permanent damage to the jacket, leading to subsequent failure of the cable. Relatively low sustained arc currents of a few milliamperes can cause eventual aging degradation of the cable. The magnitude of current available in an arc (and probability of damage) depends on the geometry of the installation and is not simply correlated with the voltage of the transmission line. Wetting conditions near industrial plants or saltwater will have more severe effect on the jacket resistance than in freshwater rain or fog. While one measure to protect cables from dry-banding damage incorporates a semiconducting layer to equalize potential, a more feasible method uses externally applied protection within 50 metres of each support, since this is the area most susceptible to damage.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>dry</b> <b>bands</b> on a wet {{pollution}} {{layer in}} insulator flashover {{has been well}} described in the literature. Silicone rubber insulators are now widely used because of their superior performance in high voltage power systems under polluted environments. However, the discharge activity is not totally eliminated under pollution and it may initiate tracking and erosion on the insulator surface. For this reason, effective laboratory tests of formulations of polymeric materials and insulator designs are a key point for long term performance. Research at Cardiff University established new test procedures {{in order to achieve}} controlled, reproducible evaluation of contaminated 11 kV silicone rubber composite insulators. Electrical parameters of voltage and leakage current are recorded during flashover tests of polluted insulators in a clean-fog chamber; in addition a high-definition camera and an IR camera are used to capture video records of the discharge activity. Computer procedures have been developed to post-process visual and IR records. Since the quantity of data is great, this is not a trivial task. In particular it is possible to evaluate the number of <b>dry</b> <b>bands</b> present at any selected instant, their location and temperature; the number of pixels belonging to each spark is calculated since it can give a good indication of spark extension and position. With the adoption of the new test technique and the post-processing procedure of electrical, visual and IR data, it is possible to evaluate not only the flashover condition but also to determine accurately variations of the <b>dry</b> <b>bands</b> and the discharge activity during the test...|$|R

40|$|Room {{temperature}} vulcanizing (RTV) {{silicone rubber}} protective coatings {{are applied to}} electrical insulators to improve their insulation strength under wet conditions. The electrical performance of RTV silicone rubber insulator coatings under accelerated aging in a salt-fog chamber for artificial testing has been investigated. Experimental and theoretical {{studies were carried out}} on RTV silicone rubber coatings to study the loss and recovery of hydrophobicity. The effect of the experimental conditions and the contaminants deposited during <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing was studied with respect to the performance of RTV coatings. Five cleaning methods to remove the contaminants from the coated surface were examined using leakage current and contact angle measurements as indicators of their comparative effectiveness. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) was used to determine the composition of the elements of the scale near the surface and in the bulk of the RTV coating. The ability of RTV coatings to suppress leakage current in the presence of contamination thereby preventing power outages was extensively studied. The temporary loss of hydrophobicity and its recovery was studied in depth. The gradual loss of hydrophobicity as determined from the leakage current and the contact angle measurements is shown {{to be related to the}} physical and chemical changes to the coating brought about by <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing. The suppression of leakage current by RTV silicone rubber coatings on porcelain suspension and post insulators was studied in a salt-fog chamber. To investigate the phenomenon of the loss and the recovery of hydrophobicity, the surface was subjected to various wetting conditions. Measurements of the contact and the sliding angles were used to determine the state of the surface. The surface free energies due to London dispersion (γ SD) and hydrogen bonding (γ SH) forces on the surface of RTV coatings were calculated from the contact angle measurements using both water and methylene iodide. Good agreement was obtained with the literature values for a virgin RTV surface. In order to study the chemical changes due to <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing on the surface of RTV coatings, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) was employed. A study of the diffusion of silicone fluid using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is carried out. The results of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and ESCA measurements are discussed from which a suppression mechanism of leakage current is suggested. The chemical derivative analysis is also carried out to elucidate the chemical changes on the surface of RTV coating. Several mechanisms are suggested with regard to the formation of water film, the suppression of leakage current on RTV coatings, development of <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing, the temporary loss and recovery of hydrophobicity, heat transfer in the presence of <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing, and chemical reactions and changes at the surface due to <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing.

40|$|Insulator becomes wet {{partially}} or completely, and {{the pollution}} layer on it becomes conductive, when collecting pollutants {{for an extended}} period during dew, light rain, mist, fog or snow melting. Heavy rain is a complicated factor that it may wash away the pollution layer without initiating other stages of breakdown or it may bridge the gaps between sheds to promote flashover. The insulator with a conducting pollution layer being energized, can cause a surface leakage current to flow (also temperature-rise). As the surface conductivity is non-uniform, the conducting pollution layer becomes broken by dry bands (at spots of high current density), interrupting the flow of leakage current. Voltage across insulator gets concentrated across dry bands, and causes high electric stress and breakdown (<b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcing). If the resistance of the insulator surface is sufficiently low, the <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> arcs can be propagated to bridge the terminals causing flashover.

40|$|Abstract:- Polymeric {{insulating}} materials are now {{widely used in}} high voltage electrical apparatuses. Several of them are being used for outdoor insulators. For outdoor application, the insulation may severe {{a certain degree of}} pollution which may reduce their surface resistance and flash over voltages. Under these conditions a large leakage current (LC) may flow on the surface and degradation may take place. In long term the degradation may lead to the flash over of the insulators. In this paper experimental results on the leakage current characteristics of epoxy resin insulation under various environmental conditions are reported. The samples used are blocks of epoxy resin with dimension of 250 x 50 x 20 mm 3. The samples were put in a test chamber with controlled humidity and pollution conditions.

40|$|Inclined-plane {{tests of}} silicone-rubber samples {{prepared}} with textured patterns of hemispherical protuberances are described. These are {{compared with the}} results obtained for conventional non-textured plane-surface samples of the same material. A remarkable improvement is achieved by such texturing: a material which normally fails the test is enabled to satisfy the standard test criteria, and the tracking and erosion of the samples caused by the tests are significantly reduced. These texturing techniques are currently being extended to prototype composite insulators. It is shown that this improvement for textured samples {{is a result of}} the formation of a stable, controlled <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> on the polluted surface. Although discharge inception occurs across the band, these discharges result in a fall, rather than an increase, of the leakage current. The transition to a higher current arc phase is thus inhibited, compared with non-textured samples for which stable dry bands did not occur. These observations of reproducible <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> breakdown also provide an opportunity to characterize experimentally the electrical properties of these discharges. A recent proposed model represents the dry-band discharge as a streamer-spark structure, in contrast to the standard model of an arc-like interdependence of current and voltage.

40|$|The {{established}} {{model of}} the flashover of an insulator, whose surface {{is covered with a}} moist, conducting layer of pollution, envisages that it develops from the formation and bridging of a <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> by a partial-arc pre-discharge. This pre-discharge is assumed to possess arc characteristics, so that the electric field across the <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> will fall as the partial arc current increases. Observations of insulators which are only lightly polluted, however, show that pre-discharges are of low luminosity and rich in ultraviolet, and resemble the spark leader inception and extension sequence in air gaps. This is because the current limitation by low values of surface-layer conductance can inhibit the transition to an arc at the pre-discharge stage. An alternative model using simplified voltage-current equations is developed to represent these spark properties rather than an arc characteristic. The predictions of the partial-arc model and this new approach are both tested here, using published experimental data from light-pollution fog tests in the authors' laboratory. For this purpose, the partial-arc theory is further developed in order to reveal its implied prediction for the increase of pre-discharge length with applied voltage before flashover. A corresponding relationship is obtained for the increase of spark leader length using the new model. It is found that for light pollution, the dry-band spark model better represents the test data than the partial-arc model. Consequent predictions are made for the variation of flashover voltage with pollution severity in this regime, which may account for anomalous insulation failures...|$|E

It is a unique advantage of this material. However, the pollution layer on silicone rubber absorbs moisture at high air humidity similar to the pollutants on the glass surface.

This leads to <b>dry</b> <b>band</b> formation, arcing and possible surface erosion.
