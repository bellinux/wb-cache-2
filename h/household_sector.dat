50|$|A {{popular belief}} in {{economics}} {{is that the}} <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> is a wealth spender rather than a wealth creator, although many argue that the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> plays {{a very important role}} in wealth creation. Unlike the business sector, the wealth created by the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> is not financial wealth, which is unsurprising in that much of the work done in the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> is unpaid. The resulting wealth falls into the category of social wealth because the care work that parents perform in raising a child increases that child's ability to perform in society later. As a whole, the individuals who benefit from having received care perform better in academic and social settings, enabling them to create financial wealth later in life and to play a part in increasing social capital.|$|E

40|$|Although rising {{food prices}} have hit {{hard on a}} large number of {{households}} in many developing countries, the vulnerability in terms of food security varies across different <b>household</b> <b>sectors</b> within a country. In this study we have developed a simple analytical model and used it to examine the food security vulnerability across different households to a shock in food prices by using three commonly-known <b>household</b> <b>sectors</b> (urban, rural, estate) in Sri Lanka. In particular, we have estimated the combined impact of income and price rises on food security of these sectors. Our empirical results suggest that the overall food security in all three household groups (measured in terms of real food consumption above the poverty line food consumption) has been marginally decreasing over time in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the negative effect of rising food prices has been partially offset by the positive income effect in all three <b>household</b> <b>sectors.</b> The results also suggest that the urban sector is highly vulnerable to a food price shock than the other two sectors. The least vulnerable group is the rural sector, whilst the estate sector lies in the middle. Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsNo Full Tex...|$|R

The law basically captures and understands the essential spending {{behavior of the}} <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> Keynes uses the term 'psychology' in his law but the law is just a basic observation of consumer behavior and consumption.It states the relationship between income and consumption pattern, such as {{the changes in the}} aggregate income of the economy and the expenditures on consumption by the <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> The law is thus, a macro framework of the operation of the economy as it applies more to the aggregate economy than to the individuals. Therefore, in Keynesian macroeconomics, the fundamental psychological law underlying the consumption function states that marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and marginal propensity to save (MPS) are greater than zero (0) but less than one (1): MPC + MPS = 1; e.g., whenever national income rises by $1 part of this will be consumed and part of this will be saved ...|$|E

We found that in all three study periods, the changes in economic activity, population size, and energy consumption per capita stimulated emissions, whereas the changes in energy intensity, the urban and rural population distribution structure, and the energy mix of the production and <b>household</b> <b>sectors</b> decreased emissions. In contrast, changes in the economic structure decreased emissions in the first and third periods, and increased emissions in the second period. Our results clearly indicate that under current practices, carbon emissions will increase as a result of rapid growth of the economy, the population, and the energy consumption per capita. In the future, the main routes to reduce carbon emissions will be to adjust the economic structure and energy mix, and to reduce the energy intensity of each sector...|$|R

The minus (-) sign in the table represents that the sector has paid out while the plus (+) sign indicates the receipts of that sector, e.g, -C for the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> shows that the household has paid for their consumption whereas the counter party of this transaction is the firm which receives +C. This implies that the firms have received the payments from the households. Similarly, all the respective flows in the economy are reported in {{the flow of}} funds. More advanced SFC models consist of a financial sector including banks and is further extended to an open economy by introducing the Rest of World sector.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> finds itself in a net lending or net borrowing situation and to analyse the situation. Research was done against the background of the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As suggested by the 1993 SNA, the net lending situation of the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> was calculated in the capital account of the <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> It became clear that the South African household sector’s saving is in excess of its capital formation, although both components indicated a slight declining trend over the past almost thirty years. Current economic literature was used in focusing on <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving and capital formation definitions, categories, motivations and determinants. International situations with regards to saving and capital formation were also compared with that of South Africa, putting the South African situation into perspective. An econometric analysis of net household saving in South Africa for the period 1991 to 2002 indicated five factors that significantly influenced <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving over the period. The five factors comprise the income from property, the twelve-month fixed deposit rate, current taxes on income and wealth, compensation of employees and total private consumption expenditure. Making use of further data sets, it became clear that the South African government sector uses the household sector’s excess saving to finance increased current expenditure and does not channel these excess funds towards increased capital formation that would be beneficial for long-term economic growth. This study therefore suggested that the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> should be encouraged to act entrepreneurial, which will lead to increased levels of capital formation, that will in turn contribute to long-term growth, and that can be financed by the current excess saving levels of the <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> Increased capital formation will lead to increases in productivity and income. This will then enable the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> to raise its level of saving, that again can be used to finance increased levels of capital formation. The five factors that tested significantly influencing <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving in South Africa, were linked to possible policy as well as other initiatives aimed at encouraging <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving and capital formation in South Africa. This study concluded by briefly discussing three initiatives currently encouraging and promoting the importance of saving in South Africa. Prof. A. E. Loot...|$|E

This paper reviews the debt challenges in the <b>household</b> and corporate <b>sectors</b> and maps out some policy options. In particular, we document the increase in private debt prior to the crisis and consider how the corporate and <b>household</b> <b>sectors</b> have adjusted their balance sheets during the crisis. We examine previous experiences with corporate and household deleveraging and draw lessons for policymakers. We show how the macroeconomic effects of balance-sheet adjustments have been in part offset by the use of fiscal deficits, and we discuss the resulting challenges. A key lesson is the importance of maintaining economic growth and avoiding a prolonged doubledip recession in the euro area while facilitating necessary deleveraging in some over-indebted sectors and countries. We also emphasise the need for a growth strategy tailored to southern Europe. ...|$|R
