Unlike her younger sister, Vera, she had a calm temperament, but she was also extremely shy. For example, when interrogated by her tutors during lessons, she burst into tears and ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{students}} in {{lower secondary school}} stay in their classroom {{for most of the}} time (during physical education they go to the gym for example), in high school they will be the one to move <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> to the laboratory, but the teacher still has to move from one classroom to another if the lesson is not held in a laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E
50|$|The third {{renovation}} was {{the introduction}} of an intercom system, enabling live conversations between the officials and students from each classroom. All classrooms were equipped with AHUJA WS-661T/WS-664T intercom system, making the first higher secondary school in Kerala to have such system. Despite the capability of the intercom system to receive voice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> to <b>the</b> office, the system only provides voice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> office to <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> This was due to high need of audio wires and receivers that are required to send voice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> to <b>the</b> office, especially in such a multi storied school with over hundred <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> system is also used as an emergency alarm, as seen through its usage during the building collapse in 2005.|$|R

25|$|On 8 March 2000, 19-year-old {{secondary}} school student Ebrima Barry {{was murdered by}} firefighters in Brikama, West Coast Division. Barry's teacher, a Mr Paul, had called firefighters to the school after Barry had insulted him, in order to remove Barry <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> as {{he was afraid of}} a physical altercation. However, the firefighters not only removed him from the school but took him to their station where they shaved his head, beat him, forced him to carry heavy bags of cement, stripped him naked, poured cement on him and finally put cement in his mouth and forced him to swallow it. He was able to get home that night but died the next day from his injuries. Later in the week, students from Barry's {{secondary school}} converged on the local fire station in protest but were dispersed by police officers.|$|E
25|$|The war overtook Young's career {{again in}} February 1943 {{when he was}} {{one of a number of}} chief constables {{seconded}} to the War Office's Civil Affairs Training Centre and attended the first course for senior officers. Before the course was finished, he was transferred to the instructing staff and in June 1943 he was appointed the first commandant of the new Police Civil Affairs Training Centre at Peel House in London (gazetted with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel) and charged with the task of setting up the training school for policemen and provost officers who would maintain law and order in Axis territory as it was liberated by advancing Allied forces. Barely was that centre up and running and its first students through their course when Young found himself a Colonel and moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> in July 1943 to be Senior British Police Officer in the Mediterranean Theatre, stationed in North Africa awaiting the invasion of Sicily.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{well-known}} {{event is}} the 1880 Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> [...] This effort resulted in strong opposition within deaf cultures {{today to the}} oralist method of teaching deaf children to speak and lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended {{to make it easier}} for Deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of sign language is central to Deaf identity, and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.|$|E
50|$|The EVS series {{began in}} 1969 as an {{academic}} forum for global networking and the exchange of technical information.

2500|$|Thirty-five years later, in 1860, {{a school}} for the Deaf was {{established}} by another Deaf Scotsman, Thomas Pattison — [...] the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children in New South Wales. In Victoria {{just a few weeks}} later, the Victorian College for the Deaf was founded by a Deaf Englishman, Frederick J Rose, who had been educated at the Old Kent Road School in London. These schools and others had an enormous {{role in the development of}} Auslan, as they were the first contact with sign language for many Deaf children. [...] Because they were residential boarding schools, they provided ample opportunity for the language to thrive, even though in many schools, signing was banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> for much of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bilingual policy differs amongst {{students}} from the various ethnic groups. For the Chinese, when the policy was first implemented, many students found themselves struggling with two foreign languages: English and Mandarin. Even though several different Chinese varieties were widely spoken at home, they were excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> as {{it was felt that}} they would be an [...] "impediment to learning Chinese". Today, although Mandarin is widely spoken, proficiency in second languages has declined. In response to these falling standards, several revisions have been made to the education system. These include the introduction of the Mother Tongue [...] "B" [...] syllabus and the now-defunct EM3 stream, in both of which Mother Tongue is taught at a level lower than the mainstream standard. In the case of Mandarin, Chinese students would study Chinese [...] "B".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. [...] However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. [...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. [...] "uper-comfortable diapers" [...] have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they {{need to go to the}} toilet. [...] Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents plays a major role in the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.|$|E

2500|$|At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did {{not impose}} his artistic style or {{techniques}} on his students; in fact, he kept {{much of his}} work and exhibitions hidden <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys' actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality {{and the need for}} students to take draughtsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys' pedagogy included open “ring discussions,” where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of Beuys' ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that “everyone [...] an artist.” Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys' students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder, anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Kočić left Gomionica {{after two}} years and {{completed}} his primary education at the Eastern Orthodox religious school in Banja Luka, though {{he returned to the}} monastery every summer in order to spend time with his father. Kočić was the best student in his class at the religious school, and upon graduating in 1891, he departed for Sarajevo to attend high school at the First Sarajevo Gymnasium. During his first three years, he excelled in subjects such as mathematics, as well as Greek, Latin, German and Serbo-Croatian, which the Austro-Hungarians deemed the [...] "language of the land" [...] (zemaljski jezik), so as not to become entangled in local ethno-linguistic disputes. Kočić experienced a violent fit in his fourth year, swearing at a theology teacher and throwing a textbook at him over a poor grade. He was dismissed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> and subjected to a monetary fine. According to a classmate, the outburst changed Kočić, [...] "turning him from an ambitious, disciplined student, into a truant and frequenter of kafanas and bars." [...] Following an incident in which a visibly intoxicated Kočić and his friends verbally abused Muslim students in a hotel bar, Kočić was expelled from the Gymnasium. He found himself unable to enroll into any of the high schools in Bosnia, having apparently drawn the ire of the Austro-Hungarian authorities. Kočić was forced to continue his education in neighbouring Serbia and enrolled into a Belgrade high school, from which he graduated in 1899.|$|E
2500|$|He {{studied at}} the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico {{following}} his dismissal from the Jesuits, and excelled at mathematics and developed a lifelong interest in the sciences. When a faculty position in Mathematics & Astrology was available, Sigüenza sought to compete for it, {{although he did not}} hold a degree in the subjects. It was not clear that he could even be eligible to compete, but Sigüenza argued successfully to do so. Selection for university posts was via oposiciones or competition between candidates. A question was posed and the candidate had to complete a response within 24 hours to be judged by a panel. Ghost writers or ringers sometimes completed the exercise and Sigüenza successfully argued that his chief rival for the position, and the person who vociferously argued that Sigüenza had no standing to even compete, had to be kept under surveillance during the competition to prevent cheating. On July 20, 1672, he was named to the chair of Mathematics and Astrology. His record as a professor was marred because he was frequently absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> due his researches on various topics and to the press of other obligations he took on for fiscal reasons. One of his biographers suggests that his absences from the university might be attributable to his disdain for astrology, which he considered [...] "a diabolical invention and consequently, alien to science, method, principle and truth." ...|$|E

30|$|Studies on {{the effect}} of <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> on student {{learning}} widely vary in outcome, highlighting the importance of the instructor, the topic, and the student population. Certain studies have thus shown that students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> score higher on both general course and critical thinking exams compared to the students attending the traditional lecture sessions (Talley and Scherer 2013; Missildine et al. 2013; Mortensen and Nicholson 2015; Hsu et al. 2016). Other studies demonstrate that there is either no statistical difference between the two (Jensen et al. 2015; Eichler and Peeples 2016; Davies et al. 2016; Hotle and Garrow 2016) or that <b>the</b> students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> perform less well than those immersed in the traditional or interactive lecture settings (Bossaer et al. 2016). Studies comparing the flip against the “productive failure” model, where the students ineffectually discuss and try to solve new concepts in the class and then work on understanding them after the class, on their own, showed no significant difference in their gain of procedural knowledge and an even lower gain of conceptual knowledge in <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> compared to its antipode (Song and Kapur 2017). Interestingly, in spite of the greater exposure to communication requiring critical thinking, students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> are shown to have lower literature searching skills than those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional <b>classroom</b> (Goates et al. 2017), necessitating the incorporation of autonomous literature searches in <b>the</b> flipped <b>classroom</b> to a greater degree.|$|R
30|$|The PSC uses video <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> of {{teachers}} {{participating in the}} PD program. Video from any teacher’s classroom situates professional development {{in the practice of}} teaching and is likely to stimulate productive discussions. However, several researchers have reported that teachers find video from their own <b>classrooms</b> and <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> of colleagues to be more motivating and to better support their learning than video <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> {{of teachers}} they do not know (Seidel et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011). In the PSC model, clips from participating teachers’ lessons using the PSC task provide a familiar mathematical context that enables the teachers to deeply explore mathematics learning and teaching and to generate specific ideas about how to better meet the needs of their particular student population. In addition, using video from teachers’ own <b>classrooms</b> reduces <b>the</b> possibility of teachers dismissing what they see because “those kids {{are not the same as}} ours.” Using video <b>from</b> <b>classrooms</b> where <b>the</b> teachers know each other requires a moderate amount of trust to view the student clips and a high degree of trust to watch the teacher clips. To share their videos, teachers must feel that they are part of a safe and supportive professional community. This must be accounted for in the design of the professional development sessions.|$|R
