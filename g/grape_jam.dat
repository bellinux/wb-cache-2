25|$|Wine {{can also}} be made from other species of grape or from hybrids, created by the genetic {{crossing}} of two species. V. labrusca (of which the Concord grape is a cultivar), V. aestivalis, V. ruprestris, V. rotundifolia and V. riparia are native North American grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for <b>grape</b> juice, <b>jam,</b> or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.|$|R
50|$|Mississippi wine {{refers to}} wine made from grapes {{grown in the}} U.S. state of Mississippi. The hot and humid climate of Mississippi makes it very {{difficult}} to cultivate vitis vinifera or French hybrid grapes.

50|$|The Catawba grape {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} Native American grapes used in wine production, but can also be eaten or made into <b>grape</b> juice, <b>jam,</b> or jelly. The Vitis International Variety Catalogue gives credit to the Scholls and describes Catawba as a crossing of the North American species Vitis labrusca with the European species Vitis vinifera and list 1819 as its likely introduction. The Oxford Companion to Wine states the vine was identified in North Carolina even earlier, in 1802, but does not state who discovered the variety. British wine expert Oz Clarke also places the vine's origins in North Carolina but claims that it was first identified in 1801.|$|R

[...] To prevent crystals forming in homemade <b>grape</b> <b>jam</b> or jelly, the prerequisite fresh grape juice should be chilled overnight to promote crystallization. The potassium bitartrate crystals are removed by filtering through two layers of cheesecloth. The filtered juice may then be made into jam or jelly. In some cases they adhere {{to the side of}} the chilled container, making filtering unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>Jam</b> {{has been}} criticized for its rather loose and mostly improvised {{performances}} which contrast sharply with the heavily produced material on Wow. However <b>Grape</b> <b>Jam</b> is also notable in that it features guest appearances on piano by Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield. This studio album was recorded in New York City in January and February 1968. Skip Spence plays guitar on [...] "Never" [...] and piano on [...] "Boysenberry Jam". Peter Lewis does not appear on this album. [...] "The Lake" [...] is a strange combination of poetry submitted by a fan (Michael Hayworth, the winner of a KFRC San Francisco songwriting contest) and avant-garde psychedelic Musique concrète sound effects somewhat like side four of Freak Out! or [...] "Revolution 9". The opening track [...] "Never" [...] is the best known song and has often been cited as the source for Led Zeppelin's song [...] "Since I've Been Loving You", the opening lyrics, bluesy arrangement and some melodic elements are virtually identical. The album was the inspiration for a number of other studio [...] "jam" [...] albums during the late 1960s and early 1970s. [...] Later examples of this trend included Al Kooper's Super Session and the 3rd LP of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.|$|E

50|$|Some {{records are}} cut with {{completely}} independent bands {{on the same}} side. In this case the bands appear as separate tracks on the record and are not intertwined as with parallel grooves (see below). This has most often been used on educational records but is also sometimes used on discs of commercial pop and rock music. These individual bands need not be cut at the same speed. The second Moby <b>Grape</b> album Wow/Grape <b>Jam</b> (1968) has this setup. Following the fourth song on side one there is a spoken announcement telling the listener to change the speed from 33 to 78 RPM to play the next band of the disc. To play the last song on the side the listener must pick up the stylus from the record, change the speed, then put the stylus {{at the start of}} the fifth and final song on side one.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFruit jams are {{preserved}} fruits and sugars normally canned or sealed for long-term storage. Jam making involves {{the disruption of}} the fruit tissue followed by heating with added water and sugar to activate its pectin before being put into containers. Processes that expose foods {{to high levels of}} heat may cause some nutrient loss. Hence, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the nutritional composition of four commonly consumed fruit jams that are available in the Malaysian market. Different brands (n= 6) of each type of fruit <b>jams</b> (<b>grape,</b> apricot, blueberry and strawberry) were sampled from supermarkets in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The sampling method used was stratified random sampling. The fruit jams were analyzed for the presence of 27 important nutrients using Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC) official methods of analysis. This study showed that fruit jams are a good source of energy and carbohydrate. The fruits jams have very low levels of fatty acids. Fruit jams may provide an affordable and convenient source of energy and carbohydrate. The data can be utilized to contribute to the enhancement of Malaysia Food Composition Database...|$|R

5000|$|As the temperance {{movement}} grew, so did {{the popularity}} of grape juice. In 1913, Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan served grape juice instead of wine during a full-dress diplomatic function, and in 1914, Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, forbade any alcoholic drinks on board of naval ships, actively replacing them with grape juice. During World War I, the company supplied [...] "grapelade", a type of <b>grape</b> <b>jam,</b> to the military and advertised aggressively. Subsequent development of new grape products and sponsorship of radio and television programs made the company very successful. An advertisement in a journal from the year 1914 states:Welch's Grape Juice has attained its popular and professional favor through merit alone. This product has been perfected and marketed under the personal direction of the physician whose name it bears and whose purpose from the beginning was to produce a liquid food possessing all the nutrient essentials necessary to metabolism in sickness and convalescence.|$|E
5000|$|The second album, Wow/Grape Jam, {{released}} in 1968, was generally {{viewed as a}} critical and commercial disappointment, even though the album charted at No. 20 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts, partially due to the special low price double-album packaging. Though Wow added strings and horns to some songs, their basic sound remained consistent from the debut album, featuring tight harmonies, multiple guitars, imaginative songwriting, and a strong level of musicianship. The album included the track [...] "Just Like Gene Autry, a Foxtrot", {{a tribute to the}} ballroom music big band era which was tracked to only be played back properly at the speed of 78 RPM.The <b>Grape</b> <b>Jam</b> LP was one of loose improvised studio jams with outside musicians; this detracted from the stronger tunes on Wow, such as the room-shaking shuffle [...] "Can't Be So Bad." [...] Also in 1968, the band contributed to the soundtrack of the movie The Sweet Ride, and appeared, credited, in the film.|$|E
50|$|Amid {{the ongoing}} legal {{proceedings}} between Moby Grape and Katz, the surviving {{members of the}} band decided to dissolve the group once again in 2001. Finally, in 2006, and after three decades of court battles, the band finally won back its name; and subsequently reformed. To celebrate, in September 2007, a reunited Moby Grape performed for over 40,000 fans at the Summer of Love 40th Anniversary Celebration in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In October 2007, Sundazed Records reissued the Grape's first five albums (with bonus tracks) on CD and vinyl. The following month, the label was forced to both withdraw and recall Moby Grape, Wow and <b>Grape</b> <b>Jam</b> from print on both vinyl and CD because of a new lawsuit by former manager Katz. Sundazed stated on their website that they were directed to withdraw the three titles by Sony BMG (inheritors of the band's original label, Columbia), from whom Sundazed had licensed the recordings. Following the reunion performance, Stevenson departed the band and semi-retired from the music industry. Moby Grape continues to perform occasionally, performing with core members Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Peter Lewis, and in such incarnations as with Skip Spence's son Omar joining on vocals and Jerry Miller's son Joseph on drums. New recording commenced in 2009, following the release of The Place and the Time, a well-received collection of demos, outtakes, alternate versions and otherwise unreleased material from the band's 1960s recording period.|$|E
5000|$|In his drawings, prints, and {{paintings}} throughout the 1970s, Ruscha experimented {{with a range}} of materials including gunpowder, vinyl, blood, red wine, fruit and vegetable juices, axle grease, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, bolognese sauce, cherry pie, coffee, caviar, daffodils, tulips, raw eggs and grass stains. Stains, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in edible substances such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like A Blvd. Called Sunset (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colourings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio Insects (1972) consists of six screen prints - three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine’s title in a salad of squashed foods.
