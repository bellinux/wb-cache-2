30|$|We have {{implemented}} and validated a novel genetic algorithm-based searching technique to find reduced models that produce moderate errors for Ca 2 + release site models that are compositionally defined from single channel Markov models.

A Ca 2 + release site composed of 10 four-state channels that are activated by the cytosolic Ca 2 + and regulated by luminal Ca 2 + is reduced by this technique and the steady state responses of the reduced model well approximate the full model in the minimal whole cell homeostasis environment (Fig. 8).|$|E
30|$|The data in {{this paper}} are from “China’s Industrial Enterprise Database” {{spanning}} from 2000 to 2007. This database includes all the basic information and financial data of the state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises above <b>designated</b> <b>size.</b> In order to improve {{the accuracy of the}} estimated results, we did a preliminary screening by referring to literature written by Jiao et al. (2015). Obviously, the survival time of the enterprise in the market should be classified as data with a long duration. For this kind of data, there are usually problems with data merging problems (censoring), which means when the study began, some companies already exist in the market, or when the end of the study, some companies have not been withdrawn from the market. In general, this merge problem produces the estimation errors. To improve the accuracy of survival estimate, we take the year 2000 as the base, delete enterprises existing before 2000, so we can overcome the problems of left merge for data with a long duration.|$|E
40|$|Clonogenic assays {{currently}} define colonies as multicellular growth units above an arbitrarily <b>designated</b> cutoff <b>size</b> {{rather than}} by the biological function of different-sized growth units. To define the cutoff size between clusters and colonies in terms of the biological function of the cells within the growth units, we directly measured the self-renewal and proliferative capacity of cells from different-sized melanoma colonies. Primary colonies formed from cells of two patients were removed, pooled according to size, and replated, and the frequency and size distribution of the secondary colonies were analyzed. Cells from primary melanoma colonies that resulted from four to eight population doublings had similar extensive proliferative and self-renewal characteristics. The results demonstrated that self-renewal was not limited to cells in large colonies and suggested that the cutoff may be below 16 cells/growth unit. These data support the use of relatively small multicellular growth units to define colonies and measure highly proliferative human melanoma tumor cells. In addition, these methods may allow the determination of the cutoff size for other tumor types in terms of the biological function of cells rather than arbitrarily <b>designating</b> a cutoff <b>size...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{electroless}} deposition method for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on glass substrates {{was developed for}} use in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements. To obtain evenly distributed AgNPs of suitable size on the glass substrates, a seeding procedure was utilized as a pretreatment before the {{electroless deposition}} of AgNPs. The AgNPs thus formed were affected by both the seeding and growing procedures. To optimize the procedures for preparation of SERS substrates, several factors, including reaction time, the concentration of silver ions, and the concentration of reducing agents (glucose) for seeding and growing procedures, were varied. The morphologies of the seeds and the resulting AgNPs on the glass substrates were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and correlated with the SERS signals from probing with para-nitrothiophenol (pNTP). The results indicated that only the seeding time and the concentration of silver ions significantly influenced the distribution and sizes of the Ag seeds on the substrates. In the growing procedures, both the concentration of silver nitrate and the reducing agent affected the morphologies of the resulting AgNPs and, hence, the SERS signals. The substrates prepared using this newly developed method offer 2 - 5 times improvement of the SERS signals compared to substrates prepared without seed treatment. Also, the AgNPs prepared by this method can be easily controlled to <b>designated</b> <b>sizes</b> with even spatial and size distributions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
