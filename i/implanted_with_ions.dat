50|$|On the {{component}} design level, fouling can often (but not always) be minimized by maintaining {{a relatively high}} (for example, 2 m/s) and uniform fluid velocity throughout {{the component}}. Stagnant regions need to be eliminated. Components are normally overdesigned to accommodate the fouling anticipated between cleanings. However, a significant overdesign can be a design error because it may lead to increased fouling due to reduced velocities. Periodic on-line pressure pulses or backflow can be effective if the capability is carefully incorporated at the design time. Blowdown capability is always incorporated into steam generators or evaporators to control the accumulation of non-volatile impurities that cause or aggravate fouling. Low-fouling surfaces (for example, very smooth, <b>implanted</b> <b>with</b> <b>ions,</b> or of low surface energy like Teflon) are an option for some applications. Modern components are typically required to be designed for ease of inspection of internals and periodic cleaning. On-line fouling monitoring systems are designed for some application so that blowing or cleaning can be applied before unpredictable shutdown is necessary or damage occurs.|$|E

High doses of the order of 10 (17) cm(- 2) have been used leading to a considerable shift of the absorption edge to lower photon energies. This shift may be attributed both to additional defect introduction and to accompanying formation of bonds between implanted ions and the atoms of the alloy, as confirmed by IR and Raman measurements.

The spectral, kinetic and thermal activation properties of the quantum dots (Si, C and SiC) formed by a subsequent annealing were studied by means of time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy under selective synchrotron radiation excitation. Independent quantum dot PL excitation channels involving energy transfer from the SiO(2) matrix point defects and excitons were discovered. A resonant mechanism of the energy transfer from the matrix point defects (E' and ODC) is shown to provide the fastest PL decay of nanosecond order. The critical distances (6 - 9 nm) of energy transport between the bulk defects and nanoclusters were determined {{in terms of the}} Inokuti-Hirayama model. An exchange interaction mechanism is realized between the surface defects (E(s) '-centres) and the luminescent nanoparticles. The peculiarities of an anomalous PL temperature dependence are explained in terms of a nonradiative energy transfer from the matrix excitons. It is established that resonant transfer to the luminescence centre triplet state is realized in the case of self-trapped excitons. In contrast, the PL excitation via free excitons includes the stages of energy transfer to the singlet state, thermally activated singlet-triplet conversion and radiative recombination...|$|E
40|$|A major area of {{research}} for integrated electronic systems {{is the development of}} systems on glass or plastic to optimize the performance/cost tradeoff. These new substrate materials impose significant constraints on electronic device fabrication, including limitations on chemical and thermal processes. Processes that do not use high temperatures have the increased flexibility needed to be used on new substrate materials. Amorphous silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been fabricated at temperatures below 300 °C, where in-situ doped layers are deposited to form the electrode regions. Unfortunately, the electrical activation and carrier mobility in these devices is exceedingly low. The conventional method of adding impurities is ion implantation. Interstitial impurities cannot contribute to conductivity, therefore electrical activation is critical for device operation. ‘When a substrate is <b>implanted</b> <b>with</b> <b>ions,</b> the ions will break up the ordered crystal lattice and induce damage in the substrate. Annealing is a thermal process that serves two purposes, to recrystallize the substrate, and electrically activate dopant ions. While dopant activation at T 3 ̆c 300 °C is not possible, anneals done at temperatures below 650 °C can be quite effective. The goal of this project is to investigate methods of activating dopants without using the high temperature processes of conventional CMOS. A designed experiment is setup to investigate annealing behavior at low temperatures (T S 650 °C). Temperatures centered on 600 °C are the focus of this design. Additional factors are investigated including annealing time, ion species, annealing technique (furnace or rapid thermal processing), and the use of pre-amorphization implants...|$|E
