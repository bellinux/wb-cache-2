5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in the <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the jaw {{and dental}} attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) {{caused by the}} drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1980s, Cameron was {{focusing}} to {{a greater}} extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a Celtic harp in her garden and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of Tai chi, took part in group sessions in Bronson Park under the tutelage of Marshall Ho'o, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in José Argüelles' The Mayan Factor and Charles Musès' The Lion Path, and undertook the Neo-shamanic practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas about a prehistoric matriarchal society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in A. S. Raleigh's Woman and Superwoman, taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.|$|E

5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E

He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery {{to raise funds for}} the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner.

25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis {{around the base of}} the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the thumb.

Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} interglobular domain (IGD) cleavage of aggrecan in {{dogs with}} naturally developing osteoarthritis (OA). Sample Population—Samples of synovial fluid (SF) obtained from 3 cubital (elbow) joints and 3 stifle <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> 4 clinically normal dogs, 24 elbow <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> 12 dogs with early-stage OA, 8 stifle <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> 5 dogs with early-stage OA, and 10 stifle <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> 9 dogs with latestage OA. Procedure—Fractions of SF were assayed for total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and also subjected to western blot analysis {{by use of}} monoclonal antibodies against neoepitopes generated by cleavage of the IGD of the aggrecan protein core by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP; BC- 14) and aggrecanase (BC- 3). Results—Total GAG content <b>of</b> SF from <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> clinically normal dogs {{did not differ from}} that of dogs with early-stage OA. The GAG content <b>of</b> SF from <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> dogs with late-stage OA was significantly lower, compared with GAG content for other SF samples. Aggrecanase-generated fragments were detected in SF from all groups but not in all samples. Matrix metalloproteinase– generated fragments were not detected in any SF samples. In early-stage OA, high-molecularweight aggrecanase-generated aggrecan catabolites were evident. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—GAG content of SF obtained from dogs with late-stage OA is significantly decreased, suggesting proteoglycan depletion of cartilage. Aggrecanases, but not MMPs, are the major proteolytic enzymes responsible for IGD cleavage of aggrecan in canine <b>joints.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> SF samples to detect aggrecanase-generated catabolites may provide an early biomarker for discriminating early- and latestage OA in dogs...|$|R

25|$|Many {{important}} {{activities of}} daily life are dependent {{on the ability to}} grasp, pinch, and oppose the thumb. In fact, thumb function constitutes about 50% of overall hand function. These abilities are in turn dependent on an intact and functional thumb CMC joint. The CMC <b>joint</b> <b>of</b> the thumb allows a wide range of motion while maintaining stability for grasp and pinch.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this {{research}} is to study laser autogenous welding process of short seam beads and filletwelds <b>of</b> lap <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> oxygen-free copper sheets 1. 0 [mm] thick. On the bases of results of quality assessment itwas proved that high power diode laser (HPDL) welded lap <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> copper sheet provide mechanical propertieson the level of parent material. Design/methodology/approach: Short seam beads and fillet welds <b>of</b> lap <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> oxygen-free copper sheets 1, 0 [mm] thick were tested, to establish the optimum parameters of high power diode laser autogenous welding process. Findings: It was shown that there is very narrow range of optimum HPDL autogenous welding parameters ofshort seam beads and fillet welds <b>of</b> lap <b>joints</b> <b>of</b> oxygen-free copper sheets 1, 0 [mm] parameters. It was provedthat high power diode laser (HPDL) autogenous welded lap joints provide mechanical properties on the levelof parent material.
