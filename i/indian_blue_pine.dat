40|$|Microbial {{inoculants}} (Trichoderma harzianum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Laccaria laccata) inoculated either {{individually or}} in combination significantly improved the growth and biomass of <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings. The ECM fungus  Laccaria laccata, when inoculated individually, showed significantly higher plant growth, followed by  Pseudomonas fluorescens  and  Trichoderma harzianum. The combined inoculation of rhizosphere microorganisms showed synergistic growth promoting action and proved superior in enhancing the growth of <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> than individual inoculation. Co-inoculation of  L. laccata with  P. fluorescens  resulted in higher ectomycorrhizal root colonization. Uptake of nutrients (N, P, K) was significantly improved by microbial inoculants, tested individually {{or in combination}}. Combined inoculation of  L. laccata  with  T. harzianum  and  P. fluorescens  significantly increased in N, P and K contents in <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings as compared to control. Acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings was also enhanced by these microorganisms.   L. laccata  exhibited higher acid phosphatase activity followed by  P. fluorescens.  </span...|$|R

It is migratory, breeding in the forests along the Himalayas of Nepal, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. They winter in the hill forests of the Western Ghats of India and in Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>blue</b> robin was {{described}} by Hodgson who placed it in a new genus Larvivora but it was later placed in the genus Luscinia. A large-sample molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that Luscinia was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including <b>Indian</b> <b>blue</b> robin were moved to the reinstated genus Larvivora. Larvivora is a sister of the species Brachypteryx montana, Brachypteryx leucophrys and Brachypteryx hyperythra.|$|R
5000|$|This tree {{is often}} known as Bhutan pine, (not to be {{confused}} with the recently described Bhutan white pine, Pinus bhutanica, a closely related species).

50|$|Based on revised {{classification}} of Champion and Seth (1968), some 13 vegetation types are represented (Bacha,1986). In general, silver fir 'Abies pindrow' and spruce 'Picea wallichian', mixed with cedar Cedrus deodar and <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> Pinus griffithii are predominant from 2,400m to 3,000m. Notable {{is the small}} expanse of chilgoza pine Pinus geradiana in the Dachan Range. At lower altitudes (1,700-2,400m) occur nearly pure stands of cedar and <b>blue</b> <b>pine,</b> and moist temperate deciduous forest, represented by horsechestnut, Aesculus indica, walnut Juglans regia, maple, Acer spp. poplar, Populus ciliata, hazel Corylus cornutam bird cherry Pasus corfnuta, ash Fraxinus cornuta and yew Taxus wallichiana. The sub-alpine zone, from 3,000m to the tree line at 3,700m, supports mostly silver fir and birch Betula utilis forest and this merges with birch -rhododendron Rhododendron campanulatum scrub, above which is alpine pasture.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out the cause of root rot disease of <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus wallichiana) seedlings which is an important limiting factor in its successful production right from the nursery raising. The pathogens associated with the disease were isolated, morphologically characterised and identified as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pini (Schlecht.) Synd. and Hans., Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn and Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. F. oxysporum was the most abundant pathogenic fungus in diseased roots of <b>blue</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings with isolation frequency of 38. 6 %, whereas R. solani and M. phaseolina showed isolation frequencies of 11. 0 and 3. 3 %, respectively. All the three fungi proved pathogenic and caused characteristic root rot symptoms when inoculated separately. Root rot disease of Pinus wallichiana seedlings was prevalent in all the three districts of Kashmir valley surveyed, during 2008 and 2009...|$|R
50|$|It {{generally}} {{occurs at}} lower altitudes than other pines in the Himalaya, from 500 - 2000 m, occasionally up to 2300 m. The other Himalayan pines are Pinus wallichiana (<b>blue</b> <b>pine),</b> Pinus bhutanica (Bhutan white pine), Pinus armandii (Chinese white pine), Pinus gerardiana (chilgoza pine) and Pinus densata (Sikang pine), Pinus kesiya (Khasi Pine).|$|R
50|$|In {{the lower}} forested zone, birch, juniper, <b>blue</b> <b>pines,</b> firs, bamboo and {{rhododendron}} grow. Above this zone the vegetation is dwarf-sized or comprises shrubs. As the altitude increases, plant life {{is restricted to}} lichens and mosses. Plants cease to grow at about 5750 m, {{because this is the}} permanent snow line in the Himalayas.|$|R
50|$|The pindrow fir or west Himalayan fir (Abies pindrow) is a fir {{native to}} the western Himalaya and {{adjacent}} mountains, from northeast Afghanistan east through northern Pakistan and India to central Nepal.
