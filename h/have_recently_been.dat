5|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth {{the size of the}} Milky Way, containing only a few billion stars.

5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, {{studies have shown}} that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought to belong to the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E

By March 2014 all services were provided by S7 Stock trains.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul {{is famous}} for its nightlife, as well as its {{historic}} taverns, a signature characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia. Along the İstiklal Avenue is the Çiçek Pasajı, now home to winehouses (known as meyhanes), pubs, and restaurants. İstiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has shifted toward shopping, but the nearby Nevizade Street is still lined with winehouses and pubs. Some other neighborhoods around İstiklal Avenue <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> revamped to cater to Beyoğlu's nightlife, with formerly commercial streets now lined with pubs, cafes, and restaurants playing live music. Other focal points for Istanbul's nightlife include Nişantaşı, Ortaköy, Bebek, and Kadıköy.|$|E
5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises. As a result, in the 2000s (decade), {{there has been a}} renewed interest in building skyscrapers in Manchester and other cities in Britain. Several residential, hotel and office developments are under construction or <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> built in the city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|Tea {{meetings}} are celebrations held in society lodges or school halls, and feature both solo and group performance, theatrical rhetoric and oratory, and other activities. After declining following World War I, tea meetings <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> revived and have regained their widespread popularity. They are held at nighttime, beginning at 9:00 pm and continuing until midnight, {{when there is}} a two-hour break for food and drink before the tea meeting is resumed.|$|E
5|$|The city of Tiruchirappalli lies on {{the plains}} between the Shevaroy Hills {{to the north and}} the Palni Hills to the south and south-west. Tiruchirappalli is {{completely}} surrounded by agricultural fields. Densely populated industrial and residential areas <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> built {{in the northern part of}} the city, and the southern edge also has residential areas. The older part of Tiruchirappalli, within the Rockfort, is unplanned and congested while the adjoining newer sections are better executed. Many of the old houses in Srirangam were constructed according to the shilpa sastras, the canonical texts of Hindu temple architecture.|$|E
5|$|The diet of bigfin reef squids {{comprises}} mainly crustaceans {{and small}} fish. They {{are found in}} the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are {{regarded as one of the}} most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa <b>have</b> <b>recently</b> <b>been</b> recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.|$|E
