25|$|In 1984, a state-directed MBTA {{study found}} that {{restoration}} of commuter rail service would be feasible. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was released in May 1990, followed by a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in 1992. Both the DEIS and FEIS included conceptual plans placing Brockton station between Crescent Street and Lawrence Street - south of the former location and just outside the downtown core. However, the station was instead constructed at the previous site, accessed behind the police station. The island platform occupies the former <b>inner</b> <b>track</b> spaces, with the line's two current tracks location where the outer tracks originally were. The Middleborough/Lakeville Line and Kingston/Plymouth Line opened for commuter service on September 29, 1997.|$|E

South of this station, the outer tracks descend to a lower level below the <b>inner</b> <b>tracks,</b> creating a two-over-two track layout.

2500|$|In {{the events}} of the third {{television}} series Stargate Universe, a third generation of stargate is discovered which allegedly predates the model originally discovered in the Milky Way galaxy. This model, discovered {{as a result of a}} three-month expedition to unlock the stargate's ninth and final chevron, was first encountered on board the ancient research vessel [...] "Destiny" [...] which has been traversing the universe for several million years unmanned, and is several billion light years away from Earth. It is discovered that the Ancients constructed the vessel to be launched after a number of stargate seed ships were dispersed in the universe in order to follow in their path and stop at each planet which a stargate was deposited. Destiny would then extract any relevant data from the planetary stargate in order to further complete research into an apparent signal embedded in the Cosmic microwave background radiation. This [...] "prototype" [...] or [...] "beta" [...] generation of gates, has a limited range. In addition, when a dialing sequence commences, the entire ring (as opposed to an <b>inner</b> <b>track,</b> like Milky Way-era gates) rotates clockwise and counterclockwise in an alternating pattern until the final chevron is locked and a wormhole is established. Finally, the event horizon of the wormhole also appears a slightly more silver color than later generations. Possibly due to the nature of how these stargates were deposited on hundreds of thousands of planets, no planetary DHD is present. Rather, explorers from Destiny are required to bring an Ancient remote control which can command the gate to dial an address in addition to other functions.|$|E
5000|$|... 3.5" [...] {{single-sided}} floppies {{had been}} used on several microcomputers and synthesizers in the early 1980s, including the Hewlett Packard 150 and various MSX computers. The standard {{on all of these}} was MFM with 80 tracks and 9 sectors per track, giving 360k per disk. However, Apple's custom interface used GCR (Group Coded Recording) and a unique format which put fewer sectors on the smaller <b>inner</b> <b>tracks</b> and more sectors on the wider outer tracks of the disk. The disk would speed up when accessing the <b>inner</b> <b>tracks</b> and slow down when accessing the outer ones. This allowed more space per disk (400k) and also improved reliability by reducing the number of sectors on the <b>inner</b> <b>tracks</b> which had less physical media to allocate to each sector.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of charged-particle trajectories with the <b>inner</b> <b>tracking</b> detectors of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC {{is a key}} input for higher-level object reconstruction, ranging from leptons to the identification of heavy-flavor jets. The {{information provided by the}} <b>inner</b> <b>tracking</b> systems has also been proven to be very powerful for disentangling the effects of several interactions occurring in the same bunch crossing. In this contribution, the performance during the Run 1 data-taking period and preparation for the next run in 2015 is reviewed. In particular, it is shown how the passive material inside the <b>inner</b> <b>tracking</b> acceptance has been further studied {{in order to reduce the}} systematic errors on the tracking efficiency, with benefits for physics measurements. In addition, the developments in disentangling close-by tracks which naturally occur in the decay of very high-pT objects (e. g. tau leptons) or jets are presented. The ongoing upgrade of the ATLAS detector includes an additional silicon layer (IBL) in the <b>inner</b> <b>tracking</b> system; the preparation for the integration of the new hardware and its expected performance is reviewed as well. Finally a summary of recent developments of the tracking software aiming for speed and disk-space optimizations is presented...|$|R
