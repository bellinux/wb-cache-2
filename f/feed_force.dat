50|$|In DTH drilling, the {{percussion}} mechanism - {{commonly called}} the hammer - is located {{directly behind the}} drill bit. The drill pipes transmit the necessary <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> and rotation to hammer and bit plus compressed air or fluids for the hammer and flushing of cuttings. The drill pipes {{are added to the}} drill string successively behind the hammer as the hole gets deeper. The piston strikes the impact surface of the bit directly, while the hammer casing gives straight and stable guidance of the drill bit. This means that the impact energy does not have to pass through any joints at all. The impact energy therefore is not lost in joints allowing for much deeper percussion drilling. This is a great breakthrough for smaller portable water well drilling rigs, that before were limited. The DTH on smaller rigs now can get same results as large heavy truck rigs.|$|E

In this paper, the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> estimated with the aid of an inexpensive current sensor installed on the ac servomotor of a computerized numerical control turning center is used to monitor tool {{wear condition}}. To achieve this, the feed drive system is modeled, using neuro-fuzzy techniques, to provide the framework for estimating the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> based on the feed motor current measured. Functional dependence of the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> on tool wear and cutting parameters are then expressed in the form of a difference equation relating variation in the <b>feed</b> cutting <b>force</b> to tool wear rate.

40|$|Objectives: Prolonged {{exposure}} to severe chipping hammer vibration may cause hand–arm vibration syndrome. A reliable test method {{is required to}} select appropriate tools and assist {{in the development of}} better chipping hammers. In the present study, the ISO standardized test method (ISO 8662 - 2, 1992) was examined through an investigation of the vibration character-istics of chipping hammers operating on the energy absorber specified in the standard. Methods: The energy absorber and test setup were designed and constructed based on those specified in the standard. The experiment employed six subjects and used two pneumatic chip-ping hammers and three different feed forces (50, 100 and 200 N). The subject posture was the same as that specified in the standard. Results: The vibration emission at the tool dominant frequency (or air blow rate) generally declined with an increase in <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> thus decreasing the frequency-weighted accelerations. The increase in <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> however, resulted in an increase in the unweighted vibration emis-sion at high frequencies. The chipping hammer vibration emission operating on the energy absorber at the high <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> (200 N) was inconsistent. Conclusions: The measurement method has a good repeatability except at a high <b>feed</b> <b>force.</b> The <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> has a significant effect on the vibration emission. The single <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> specified in the standard may not be sufficient to test the tool behaviors. Multiple levels of <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> should be used for the chipping hammer test. Doing so may provide a more appropriate basis for tool screening...|$|E

40|$|In rotary drilling, {{specific}} energy {{is considered to}} be an important parameter for defining mechanical efficiency of the rock destruction process. Specific Energy is defined as the energy required to remove one unit of rock. Specific energy is the function {{of the size of the}} borehole and various operational parameters including <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> rotation speed, rotation torque and penetration rate. The harder the material, the higher the {{specific energy}}. The traditional method to calculate the specific energy is based on the parameters penetration rate, <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> torque and rotation speed, that can be provided by Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data from the drill process. In this study, MWD data from an open pit mine in Sweden are used to evaluate data trends among logged parameters and calculated average specific energy. The results show that there is a significant hole length dependency for penetration rate and <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> that affects the predicted specific energy. This may be explained by that the hole cleaning efficiency is reduced with increasing hole length. The analysis shows that the specific energy is over-estimated by 45 % in the bottom of an 18 m hole compared to the collaring point. The suggested solution is to use hole average or complement the specific energy calculation with a hole length related component.
