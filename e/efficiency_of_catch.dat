Use of the pool increased the catchment area of the trap by 103 times, resulting in a 4. 6 times {{increase in the number}} of black beetle and a 58 times {{increase in the number of}} black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus (Walker), caught. There was increased sensitivity in detection of flight at the lower activity extremes, so that the total number of evenings on which flight activity was recorded during individual flight seasons was increased by a factor of 1. 4 for black beetle and 2. 7 for black field cricket. The modified trap could also be useful in insect surveys, and flight monitoring or recapture studies of a variety of other insect species. New Zealand Entomologist, 1979, Vol. 7, No. 1 9...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} already {{demonstrated}} the usefulness and <b>efﬁciency</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops to reduce nitrate leaching from cropping systems into groundwater. Catch crops must be sown in summer in a temperate climate, when {{the soil is}} often dry after the main crop harvest. This can lead to poor crop establish- ment. The present study uses a model to explore differences in the emergence rates of catch crops in summer {{for a wide range}} of soil and weather conditions that occur in France and identiﬁes the main causes of failure. The SIMPLE model predicts the emergence duration and rate of crops by considering species and seed characteristics in interaction with seedbed conditions (temperature, moisture, clods and surface crust). The model was previously validated for white mustard and seems appropriate for the present work of simulating ryegrass and vetch emergence under contrasted weather and water stress conditions. Simulations were performed {{for a wide range of}} pedoclimatic conditions and sowing prac- tices (dates, depth and seedbed structures). Soil water content and temperature in the upper layers of the soil were ﬁrst simulated with the STICS soil-crop model and were then validated in an initial step by comparing simulations with experimental data. These outputs were then used as input data for the SIMPLE emergence model. Results showed that, on average, the emergence rates of catch crops sown in summer were sufﬁcient (> 75 %), regardless of species and sowing technique. Simulations indicated that a poor emergence rate (< 50 %) occurred in less than one year in ten for northern sites, and two years in ten in south-western France. In regions with a Mediterranean climate, emergence varied greatly from year to year, with failures (< 25 %) approximately two years in ten and low emergence (< 50 %) in approx- imately four years in ten. In dry summer regions, poor emergence occurred more frequently with early sowing (mid-July) due to water stress, while later sowing (around September 15) was generally more successful. Predictions indicate that sowing date is the management choice with the most impact and that it must be carefully adapted to weather to maximise the potential of catch crops to trap nitrate and thus minimise nitrate leaching. This work illustrates the application of modelling as a tool for evaluating risks and optimising the management of catch crops for a wide range of conditions, which thus increases the success of emergence and cover establishment under ﬁeld conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{measured}} the technical <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>catch</b> and its socio-economic determinants among traditional fishermen dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Shon Beel in Karimganj district of Assam, India. Empirical estimations {{are on the}} basis of primary data collected from a sample of fishermen during the peak fishing season of 2014. The study uses a log-linear stochastic production frontier with inefficiency effects where selected non-input socioeconomic variables are hypothized to explain variations in catch efficiency across fishing teams. The study finds that technical <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>catch</b> at the fishing team level is influenced positively by experience and per –capita household expenditure. Non-fishing income, dependency ratio, and education are found to have a dampening effect on catch efficiency. The study opines that excessive fishing in the Sone Beel in recent years has necessitated greater catch effort to get the same quantity <b>of</b> <b>catch.</b> This is indicative of falling fish stock, premature catch, and consequently falling average size <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> irrespective <b>of</b> species...|$|R

Pre-pubertal male rats were subjected to a 17 days food restriction followed by re-feeding for nine days with 1, 3 PA or BPA-containing diets.

The BPA-containing diet improved most growth parameters: humeri length and EGP height were greater in the BPA-fed animals. Further analysis of the EGP revealed that the hypertrophic zone was significantly higher in the BPA group. In addition, Affymetrix analysis revealed that the diet affected the expression of several genes in the liver and EGP. Despite the very subtle difference between the diets and the short re-feeding period, we found a small but significant improvement in most growth parameters in the BPA-fed rats.

40|$|The fishing {{industry}} is heavily reliant {{on the use}} of fossil fuel and emits large quantities of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. Methods used to calculate fishing vessel emissions inventories have traditionally utilised estimates <b>of</b> fuel <b>efficiency</b> per unit <b>of</b> <b>catch.</b> These methods have weaknesses because they do not easily allow temporal and geographical allocation of emissions. A large proportion of fishing and other small commercial vessels are also omitted from global shipping emissions inventories such as the International Maritime Organisation’s Greenhouse Gas Studies. This paper demonstrates an activity-based methodology for the production of temporally- and spatially-resolved emissions inventories using data produced by Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). The methodology addresses the issue of how to use AIS data for fleets where not all vessels use AIS technology and how to assign engine load when vessels are towing trawling or dredging gear. The results of this are compared to a fuel-based methodology using publicly available European Commission fisheries data on fuel efficiency and annual catch. The results show relatively good agreement between the two methodologies, with an estimate of 295. 7 kilotons of fuel used and 914. 4 kilotons of carbon dioxide emitted between May 2012 and May 2013 using the activity-based methodology.
