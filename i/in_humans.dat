40|$|Germ {{cells are}} {{responsible}} for transferring genetic information from parents to offspring, highlighting the significance of normal germ cell development. Epigenetic modifications, which modify gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, can affect the fate of germ cells. Abnormal epigenetic reprogramming will facilitate abnormal germ cell development; therefore, understanding of epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms {{can contribute to the}} discovery of medical interventions for reproductive disease. DNA methylation and histone modification are two main components of epigenetic modifications. Both of them play important roles in mammalian germ cells development. <b>In</b> <b>human</b> germ cells, very few observations about these epigenetic modifications have been reported. Therefore, this report aims to form the major epigenetic reprogramming study conducted <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal germ cells, establishing an accurate timeline of events pertaining to this process <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal germ cells. Specifically, this research is divided into understanding (1) the process of histone modifications <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal germ cells; (2) the reprogramming of DNA methylation and its related modifiers <b>in</b> <b>human</b> germ cell development; (3) the impact of chemical DNA demethylation in the expression of germ cell-specific genes and the meiotic genes <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>in</b> vitro and ex vivo. Studies <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal gonads indicated that histone modifications changed dynamically during human fetal germ cell development. Experiments addressing DNA methylation reprogramming <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal germ cells collectively reveal a trend towards DNA demethylation and reductions in 5 -methylcytosine (5 mC), in the instance of both fetal ovarian and testicular germ cells alike. Furthermore, 5 mC was re-detected <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal testicular germ cells at fetal stage, but <b>in</b> <b>human</b> fetal ovarian germ cells after birth. The studies <b>in</b> <b>human</b> germ cells here demonstrated that the existence of 5 mC and 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) were synchronous rather than alternate. Determination of the levels of TET (ten-eleven translocation) proteins (TET 1, 2 and 3) reveal higher levels during the 1 st trimester, with subsequent reductions in levels with gestations. Additional findings, from the studies <b>in</b> a <b>human</b> testicular germ cell tumor cell line, TCam- 2 cells, and human fetal gonads, showed that treatments with DNA demethylating agents are linked to the activation and increase of post-migratory germ cell-specific genes along with meiotic genes <b>in</b> <b>human.</b> To conclude, the results from this study demonstrate that epigenetic changes, such as histone modification and DNA methylation, are dynamic <b>in</b> <b>human</b> germ cells, the precise nature of which necessitates further research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Transient {{receptor}} potential melastatin- 7 (TRPM 7) channels {{have been}} recently reported <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial fibroblasts and {{are believed to}} mediate fibrogenesis <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial fibrillation. The present study investigates whether TRPM 7 channels are expressed <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial myocytes using whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. It was found that a gradually activated TRPM 7 -like current was recorded with a K?- and Mg 2 ?-free pipette solution <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial myocytes. The current was enhanced by removing extracellular Ca 2 ? and Mg 2 ?, and the current increase could be inhibited by Ni 2 ? or Ba 2 ?. The TRPM 7 -like current was potentiated by acidic pH and inhibited by La 3 ? and 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. In addition, Ca 2 ?-activated TRPM 4 -like current was recorded <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial myocytes {{with the addition of}} the Ca 2 ? ionophore A 23187 in bath solution. RT-PCR and Western immunoblot analysis revealed that in addition to TRPM 4, TRPM 7 channel current, mRNA and protein expression were evident <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial myocytes. Inter-estingly, TRPM 7 channel protein, but not TRPM 4 channel protein, was significantly increased <b>in</b> <b>human</b> atrial speci-mens from the patients with atrial fibrillation.
