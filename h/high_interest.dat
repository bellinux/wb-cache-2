5|$|In {{areas where}} there was a <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> in air cadets, {{additional}} squadrons were established with different parade nights to accommodate the numbers. These squadrons were often placed into air cadet wings (a formation of two or more squadrons) with a separate wing HQ staff of both officers and senior cadets overseeing the operation. The system was discontinued in the late 1960s and all squadrons became independent once again.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the burdens of <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E
40|$|After the {{economic}} recovery has strengthened and inflation rates have increased, hopes for <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates emerged among savers, while debtors began to fear higher financing costs.

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above par value, but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.|$|E
5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with <b>high</b> <b>interest,</b> but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E

40|$|Good {{monetary}} policy requires estimates {{of all of}} its effects: {{monetary policy}} impacts traditional economic variables such as output, unemployment rates, and inflation. But does monetary policy influence crime rates? By extending the vector autoregression literature, we derive estimates of the dynamic effect of <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates on crime rates. <b>Higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates have socially and statistically significant positive effects on rates of theft and knife robberies, while effects on rates of burglary and assault are smaller and statistically insignificant. <b>Higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates {{have no effect on}} homicide rates. We conclude that monetary policy influences the rate of economically-motivated crimes. crime, monetary policy, vector autoregressive models (VARs) ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1962 and 1965 Britain {{engaged in}} covert {{operations}} {{in support of}} Royalist forces fighting the Egyptian backed Republican regime that had seized power in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 1962. Until the end of 1965, the British presence in Aden was considered of <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> to the United Kingdom, linked to the realization of oil assets in the Middle East. The means to secure this presence however involved a bitter argument within the British government, with no coherency in decision making on the Yemen issue. The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the Federation of South Arabia, which complicated British relations with many global and regional players, {{as well as with}} the rulers of South Arabia themselves. The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization (BMO), which was capable to stage its own covert operations, independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia. The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.|$|E

40|$|In many countries, {{local governments}} {{operating}} {{on a small scale}} face a choice between amalgamation and cooperation. This paper applies a novel methodology to investigate the implications of this choice for operating efficiency. Using a unique micro-level dataset of over 11, 000 loans made to both municipalities and intermunicipal organizations in the Netherlands, we show that the latter consistently pay <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates than the former. That is remarkable, because credit risk is zero in both cases, and we control for loan characteristics like amortization and maturity. In contrast, municipal amalgamation does not result in <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Possible legal or administrative costs associated with enforcing loan guarantees cannot explain the <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> paid by intermunicipal organizations. That is because we find that public companies (which may default) do not pay <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates than public bodies (which never default). Surprisingly, the number of partners cooperating in an intermunicipal organization does not affect interest rates. Thus, we find no evidence for the “law of 1 /n”...|$|R
