5000|$|The halt {{was between}} [...] and Stroud, {{at the end}} of <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> Lane, and was {{originally}} opened as <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> Crossing Halt before being renamed in July 1957. The halt consisted of a wooden crossing and a pair of platforms, each with GWR pagoda style shelters. Electric lighting was installed 1939 at an estimated cost of £108. Electric treadles and bells were provided either side of the crossing to warn passengers of trains approaching.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> {{produced}} textiles from 1601 to 2000, {{when the}} carpet manufacturer occupying the premises ceased trading. It presently lies empty.|$|R
500|$|Navigation on {{the first}} [...] from Burrowbridge to <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> was much easier than on the final stretch to Taunton, and in 1638, John Mallett, the Sheriff of Somerset and member of {{parliament}} for Bath, obtained a Commission under the Great Seal from King Charles II. This granted him and his heirs sole navigation rights from Bridgwater to <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills,</b> and allowed him to improve the river at his own expense. He saw this as a philanthropic action, as it reduced the price of coal to the poor people of Taunton, as well as improving the transport infrastructure.|$|R
500|$|Stembridge Mill was {{constructed}} for Robert Tatchell in 1822. It incorporated parts {{from the earlier}} <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill,</b> {{a few hundred yards}} to the north east. The mill has a [...] tower situated on an old mill mound, surrounded by a low wall intended to keep people and livestock away from the sails.|$|R
50|$|According to his will, {{drawn up}} in 1753, Hore was living at <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills</b> in Thatcham, {{and he was}} to leave his land, {{property}} and shares connected with the River Kennet to his sister-in-law, Ann Cook. Hore died on 12 April 1763, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Thatcham on 16 April.|$|R
50|$|Stembridge Mill was {{constructed}} for Robert Tatchell in 1822. It incorporated parts {{from the earlier}} <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill,</b> {{a few hundred yards}} to the north east. The mill has a 26 ft tower situated on an old mill mound, surrounded by a low wall intended to keep people and livestock away from the sails.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 October 1903, the GWR {{introduced}} a steam railmotor service {{along the route}} between [...] and Chalford, serving the existing stations at [...] and Brimscombe as well as four new stopping places, each of which was situated close to a level crossing: St Mary's Crossing, <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> Crossing, Downfield Crossing and Ebley Crossing.|$|R
50|$|In 1638 he {{obtained}} a Commission under the Great Seal from King Charles II {{to improve the}} navigation on the River Tone. This granted him and his heirs sole navigation rights from Bridgwater to <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills,</b> and allowed him to improve the river at his own expense. He saw this as a philanthropic action, as it reduced the price of coal to the poor people of Taunton, as well as improving the transport infrastructure.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> Halt {{was opened}} on 12 October 1903 {{on what is}} now the Golden Valley Line between Kemble and [...] This line was opened in 1845 as the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway from Swindon to Gloucester and this was one of many small {{stations}} and halts built on this line for the local passenger service. This halt opened with the introduction of the GWR steam railmotor services between [...] and Chalford.|$|R
5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills</b> and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|R
500|$|With {{the death}} of Mallett and later his son, work on the {{maintenance}} of the river ceased, and its condition declined. By 1697, trade was threatened, and a group of 34 merchants and traders petitioned parliament for powers to take over the navigation. An Act of Parliament dated 24 March 1699 created the Conservators of the River Tone, giving them powers [...] "for making and keeping the River Tone navigable from Bridgewater to Taunton, in the county of Somerset", which included the purchase of the navigation rights from Bridgwater to <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills</b> from the Mallett estate, for which a price of £330 was agreed.|$|R
5|$|Navigation {{was further}} {{affected}} by {{the passing of the}} Somersetshire Drainage Act on 1 July 1878, which resulted in the River Parrett being taken over by the Drainage Commissioners, and abandoned as a navigation. Limited traffic continued to use the lower reaches of the Tone, with the last barge using the Burrowbridge to <b>Ham</b> <b>Mills</b> section in 1929. In 1967 the Somerset River Authority applied to the Ministry of Agriculture for permission to remove the navigation rights, and the original acts of parliament were repealed under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act (1930). This allowed the river through Taunton to be straightened, and a weir to be constructed at Firepool, to improve the flood defences for Taunton. Above the weir, the river is still navigable as far as French Weir.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} {{improvements to the}} river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between <b>Ham</b> <b>Mill</b> and a new mill {{which was to be}} built at Knapp. The Dean and Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a fish weir, as the river was an important source of fish for the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to complain to the Dean and Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new <b>mill</b> at <b>Ham.</b>|$|R
500|$|<b>Ham</b> <b>Mills</b> was {{a site of}} milling {{activity}} from mediaeval times until about 1914. The mill was situated on {{an island in the}} middle of the river, with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the lock channel to the south. The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826. The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that [...] "boats were passing at all hours of the night." [...] Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream, and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam-driven turbine which the miller installed. Milling ceased in 1914, when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department, so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper. A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.|$|R
2500|$|Domesday Book {{does not}} mention any mill at Monks Risborough, but there was {{certainly}} a mill there by the 14th century. During the 14th and 15th centuries the millward was several times brought before the manor court accused of overcharging. In 1535 the valuation, made prior to the dissolutioon of the monasteries, showed Monks Risborough (part of {{the property of the}} Priory of Christchurch, Canterbury) as having two mills, which brought in for the Priory an income of £25.8s.11d a year. In the 17th century the then Lord of the Manor owned two mills at his death, a watermill and a windmill on 'Brokenhill' Excavations in 2002/06 found the site of a former windmill on the top of Whiteleaf Hill, thought to have been there in the 16th and 17th centuries. [...] The watermill was at the house still called Mill House in Mill Lane. [...] The map attached to the Inclosure Award of 1839 showed this property, described as 'The <b>Ham.</b> <b>Mill</b> House', with a millpond behind it and two fields marked as Mill Meadow and Mill Mead It is not known when it had ceased {{to be used as a}} working mill.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012 reports {{surfaced}} of {{an alleged}} bust {{up with new}} manager Nigel Pearson, which Mills denied. He then lost the captaincy and was relegated to training with the club's youth academy. He did not travel for the 1-0 victory against Derby County on 23 February 2012, which prompted questions over his future at the club. Mills was later informed by phone that {{he was allowed to}} leave Leicester. But despite being linked with league rivals Leeds United and West <b>Ham</b> United, <b>Mills</b> refused to leave on loan as it would have been [...] "very disrespectful for the fans". Though this move away from the club did not materialise, he never played for Leicester again.|$|R
5|$|Tatchell leased {{the mill}} to his {{son-in-law}} John Sherrin, who inherited the mill in 1824 following Tatchell's death. When Sherrin died, the mill passed to his three sons, although only one, Robert, worked the mill. Simon Spearing became the miller in 1869. He was later assisted {{by his son}} William, who lost an arm when he was thirteen due to an accident at a watermill in Low <b>Ham.</b> The <b>mill</b> was acquired by Adam Sherrin in 1881 and owned by his family until 1902. By the late 1880s, the mill was being rented by George Parker. He added a portable steam engine as auxiliary power. It drove one pair of stones. The mill was damaged by storms in 1897 or 1898 and after that was only powered by the steam engine, which had been installed in 1894, rather than the wind. The bakehouse ceased to be used around this time.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] of St Nicolas, {{which covers}} nearly , is smaller {{now than when}} it was {{established}}. [...] St Mary de Haura Church, founded in the 11th century when the new Port of Shoreham was established on the English Channel coast, {{was part of the}} parish until about 1250, when it gained independence and its own parish. [...] In the 20th century, land was taken from the east of the parish to form a new parish for St Giles' Church, newly built in neighbouring Kingston by Sea. [...] The western boundary of the present-day parish is formed by the River Adur, and the northern boundary cuts across the lower slopes of the South Downs; Parkside, Eastern Avenue, <b>Ham</b> Road and <b>Mill</b> Lane form the urban boundaries.|$|R
30|$|Saponins are {{naturally}} {{presented in a}} great number of plant species, algae, and lower marine with surface-active compounds. They can be extracted from different plant parts and seeds. The chemical structure of saponins showed one, two, or three sugar chains attached to the aglycone (tridesmosides or sapogenins). Their chemical properties and biological activity are affected according to hydrolysis process (in the presence of acids/alkali or hydrothermolysis) and storage (Oleszek and <b>Hamed</b> 2010). <b>Milling</b> is very essential in our study. Milling used to reduce size and enhances the enzymatic hydrolysis of the seeds, and also for treatment processes with dilute acid, steam or other lignocellulosic waste materials (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008). An ultrasound-assisted extraction process is used in natural phytochemical extraction because it involves disruption of the internal cell structure and liberation of intracellular compounds to surrounding medium. Ultrasound-assisted extraction processes reduce time, solvent, and energy when compared to other industrial techniques (Pingret et al. 2013). The utilization of common extraction medium (dis. water, organic solvent, and aqueous organic solvents) may improve the safety concern and sustainability and increases the extraction yield of bioactive compounds (Kua et al. 2015). The obstacles associated with the extraction of bounded phenolic encourage the researchers to discover new cost-effective and sustainable extraction technologies.|$|R
