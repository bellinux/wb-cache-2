50|$|<b>Findability</b> can {{be divided}} into {{external}} <b>findability</b> and on-site <b>findability,</b> based on where the customers need to find the information.|$|E
50|$|External <b>findability</b> is {{the domain}} of {{internet}} marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) tactics. External <b>findability</b> can be very influential for businesses. Smaller companies may have trouble influencing external <b>findability,</b> due to being less aware to consumers. Other means are taken {{to make sure that}} they are found in search results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Findability</b> Sciences {{defines a}} <b>findability</b> index {{in terms of}} each user's influence, context, and sentiments. For {{seamless}} search, current websites focus {{on a combination of}} structured hypertext-based information architectures and rich Internet application-enabled visualization techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Mark Baker, {{the author}} of [...] "Every Page is Page One", {{mentions}} that <b>findability</b> [...] "is a content problem, not a search problem". Even when the right content is present, users often find themselves deep within the content of a website {{but not in the}} right place. He further adds that <b>findability</b> is intractable, perfect <b>findability</b> is unattainable, but {{we need to focus on}} reducing the effort for finding that a user would have to do for themselves.|$|E
50|$|Baseline <b>Findability</b> is the {{existing}} <b>findability</b> before changes {{are made in}} order to improve it. This is measured by participants who represent the customer base of the website, who try to locate a sample set of items using {{the existing}} navigation of the website.|$|E
50|$|Retrievability can be {{considered}} as one aspect of <b>findability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Findability</b> {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} via the following techniques: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Findability</b> {{encompasses}} {{aspects of}} information architecture, user interface design, accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO), among others.|$|E
5000|$|On-site <b>findability</b> is {{concerned}} with the ability of a potential customer to find what they are looking for within a specific site. More than 90 percent of customers use internal searches in a website compared to browsing. Of those, only 50 percent find what they are looking for. Improving the quality of on-site searches highly improves the business of the website. Several factors affect <b>findability</b> on a website: ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{testing a}} game internally, the {{following}} results were gathered (as described in “Page Hunt: Improving search engines using human computation games”):about 27% {{of the pages}} in the test database had 100% <b>findability</b> (it means that all the persons who were shown this page could {{bring it to the}} 5 best results), while almost the same number of pages (26%) were found by nobody. Thereby, a relation between the length URL and a webpage <b>findability</b> could be postulated: The longer the URL of the webpage, the harder it was to [...] "hunt" [...] it.Also the winning search queries were analyzed and classified. The queries that contain: ...|$|E
50|$|Structuring is {{reducing}} {{information to}} its basic building units and then relating them to each other. Organization involves grouping these units in a distinctive and meaningful manner. Labeling means using appropriate wording to support easy navigation and <b>findability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Findability</b> is a {{term for}} {{the ease with which}} {{information}} contained on a website can be found, both from outside the website (using search engines and the like) and by users already on the website. Although <b>findability</b> has relevance outside the World Wide Web, the term is usually used in that context. Most relevant websites do not come up in the top results because designers and engineers do not cater to the way ranking algorithms work currently. Its importance can be determined from the first law of e-commerce, which states [...] "If the user can’t find the product, the user can’t buy the product." [...] As of December 2014, out of 10.3 billion monthly Google searches by Internet users in the United States, an estimated 78% are made to research products and services online.|$|E

50|$|<b>Findability</b> {{is similar}} to, but {{different}} from discoverability, which {{is defined as}} the ability of something, especially a piece of content or information, to be found. It is different from web search in that the word 'find' refers to locating something in a known space while 'search' is in an unknown space or not in an expected location.|$|E
50|$|Hjørland (1992, p. 185) defined {{subjects}} as the epistemological potentials of documents.This definition {{is in line}} with the request oriented understanding of indexing quoted below. The idea is that a document is assigned a subject to ease retrieval and <b>findability.</b> And the criteria for what should be found - what constitutes knowledge - is in the end an epistemological question.|$|E
5000|$|Tree {{testing is}} a way to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a website's top-down organization. Participants are given [...] "find it" [...] tasks, then asked to drill down through successive text lists of topics and subtopics to find a suitable answer. Tree testing evaluates the <b>findability</b> and labeling of topics in a site, separate from its navigation controls or visual design.|$|E
5000|$|Social {{responsibility}} in cataloging is the [...] "fair and equitable access to relevant, appropriate, accurate, and uncensored {{information in a}} timely manner and free of bias".In order to act ethically and in a socially responsible manner, catalogers should be aware of how their judgments benefit or harm <b>findability.</b> They should be careful to not misuse or misrepresent information through inaccurate or minimal-level cataloging and to not purposely or inadvertently censor information.|$|E
50|$|Though digital {{hoarding}} {{is often}} given a negative connotation, some counter {{that it is}} not an unhealthy or detrimental practice. One argument states that a large amount of digital content is not a problem in itself; rather, the problem is content <b>findability.</b> The size of the World Wide Web illustrates this point: a vast amount of content is available, but search engines such as Google have mastered effective algorithms for instantaneous <b>findability.</b> Digital hoarding can also be logical for email correspondence. Businesses often use email as the primary form of communication, so deleting conversations and documents that seem unimportant could be problematic if they are needed later. Disk storage is increasingly abundant and inexpensive, so concern over the cost of digital hoarding is rarely necessary. In addition, digital hoarding is clearly more benign than physical hoarding, which is more visible and takes up physical space. Finally, on a subjective level, digital hoarding can hardly be viewed as problematic if the consumer simply does not feel burdened by their collection of digital data.|$|E
50|$|Topic Maps is a {{standard}} for the representation and interchange of knowledge, {{with an emphasis on}} the <b>findability</b> of information. Topic maps were originally developed in the late 1990s as a way to represent back-of-the-book index structures so that multiple indexes from different sources could be merged. However, the developers quickly realized that with a little additional generalization, they could create a meta-model with potentially far wider application. The ISO standard is formally known as ISO/IEC 13250:2003.|$|E
5000|$|Ferris {{maintains}} that catalogers, in using their judgment and specialized viewpoint, uphold {{the integrity of}} the catalog and also provide [...] "added value" [...] to the process of bibliographic control, resulting in added <b>findability</b> for a library's user community.This added value also has the power to harm, resulting in the denial of access to information.Mistakes and biases in cataloging records can [...] "stigmatize groups of people with inaccurate or demeaning labels, and create the impression that certain points of view are more normal than others".|$|E
50|$|Subject {{indexing}} is the act {{of describing}} or classifying a document by index terms or other symbols in order to indicate what the document is about, to summarize its content or to increase its <b>findability.</b> In other words, it is about identifying and describing the subject of documents. Indexes are constructed, separately, on three distinct levels: terms in a document such as a book; objects in a collection such as a library; and documents (such as books and articles) within a field of knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Page Descriptions in Search Results: Now {{that the}} webpages are {{successfully}} indexed by web crawlers and {{show in the}} search results with decent ranking, {{the next step is}} to attract customers to click the link to the web pages. However, the customers can't see the whole web pages at this point; they can only see an excerpt of the webpage's content and metadata. Therefore, displaying meaningful information in a limited space, usually a couple of sentences, in search results is important for increasing click traffic of the webpages, and thus the <b>findability</b> of the web content on your webpages.|$|E
50|$|Along with loading new items regularly, UFDC was {{optimized}} for search engine <b>findability</b> using static pages and adding RSS feeds in 2008. Initially, this process included creating static pages for all {{items on the}} mirror site UFDC2 (http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/ufdc2 instead of http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/ufdc) and then in November 2010 re-optimizing the site with the single URL (http://ufdc.ufl.edu/), creating RSS feeds automatically for new items loaded and for all items, and optimizing all code for faster loading. These changes were necessary because of the deep web structure of UFDC which, like so many digital library collections, has many directory levels and dynamic URLs that cause difficulty for search engines even with properly implemented sitemaps.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 {{through the}} present, the NAP {{gradually}} evolved the Openbook to first enable better external <b>findability</b> (making the HTML page {{for the first}} page image of every chapter include the first 10 and last 10 pages of OCRed ASCII text of the chapter, to produce a robustly indexable first chapter page), as well as exploring the boundaries of knowledge discovery and exploration, implementing [...] "Related Titles" [...] in 2001, the [...] "Find More Like This Chapter" [...] in 2002, [...] "Chapter Skim" [...] in 2003, [...] "Search Builder" [...] and [...] "Reference Finder" [...] in 2004, and [...] "Active Skim" [...] and enhanced [...] "Search Builder" [...] in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Socio-semantic web {{was coined}} by Manuel Zacklad and Jean-Pierre Cahier in 2003 {{and used in}} the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). It was then {{discussed}} in Peter Morville's 2005 book Ambient <b>Findability.</b> In Chapter 6, he defines the socio-semantic web as relying on [...] "the pace-layering of ontologies, taxonomies, and folksonomies to learn and adapt as well as teach and remember." [...] Morville writes, “I’ll take the ancient tree of knowledge over the transient leaves of popularity any day”. There is undoubtedly scepticism towards the adoption of folksonomies. The socio-semantic web may be seen as a middle way between the top-down monolithic taxonomy approach like the Yahoo! Directory and collaborative tagging (folksonomy) approaches.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Morville is {{president}} of Semantic Studios, an information architecture and <b>findability</b> consulting firm. He may be best known as an influential figure and [...] "founding father" [...] of information architecture, having coauthored the best-selling book in the discipline, Information Architecture for the World Wide Web. [...] For over a decade, he has advised such clients as AT&T, Dow Chemical, Ford, the IMF, the Library of Congress, and Microsoft. Morville was a co-founder and {{past president of the}} Information Architecture Institute, and has served on their advisory board.

The enormous scope of these developments has surprised me too, {{despite the fact that}} they are more or less what many of us had hoped for and deliberately tried to bring into being. These sudden, revolutionary developments demand analysis: How is this latest information explosion changing the way we live? Is the relationship between society and individual changing? More to the point for this article, how is the Internet revolution changing education?" ...|$|E
50|$|Automobiles {{have come}} a long way since their {{beginning}} in the late 19th century. One of the major things that have helped automobiles to provide more safety and convenience is electronics. With the advances in technology and electronics, car manufacturers have been able to offer a wide variety of services and conveniences. From the creation of the Electronic Fuel Injection to the popular Global Positioning System found standard in many cars today, the auto industry has revolutionized the way people travel from place to place. So many new and exciting technologies are available that play a role in cars (from cameras that read facial expressions to sensors that measure everything going on inside as well as outside of the vehicle) that understanding the impacts on safety as well as the overall UX are very important steps to take to make it successful. Understanding how people interact with vehicles today, what contributes to a great driving experience, what is their current relationship with the car, what placement does it have in their lives, is key to the development of these technologies. This information ensures user-centered design practices to generate cohesive, predictive and desirable designs. Once specific design concepts and ideas are on the table, UXA researchers further explore how people react to them regarding desirability, <b>findability,</b> usefulness, credibility, accessibility, usability and human factors metrics. Outcomes of this work includes user requirements, concept validation, and design guidelines. Researchers have conducted intriguing research to answer questions such as: could an in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system with a speech evoked personality change your relationship with your car?, could an in-car system support unwinding after work?, could in-car solutions address the special needs of children as passengers, and assist the parents with the task of driving? and many others. Additionally, workshops and gatherings of researchers around the world take place to discuss current evaluation techniques and advance the field of experience research in the area of transportation. An important professional venue for this work is AutomotiveUI, the International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the Utrecht University website was carried out with 240 students. New criteria were drawn from the literature and operationalized for the study. These criteria are surveyability and <b>findability.</b> Web pages {{can be said to}} satisfy a usability criterion if their efficiency and effectiveness is satisfactory to the user. We operationalized efficiency and effectiveness as surveyability, that is, the users ' satisfaction with the legibility and comprehensibility of the pages and <b>findability,</b> the users ' ability to find information on the pages or the pages ' ease of use, respectively. We conducted a case study in which subjects were observed while they performed a search task on the Internet and then answered questions about <b>findability</b> and surveyability. The surveyability and <b>findability</b> criteria seem to be an effective measure of the usability of web pages and give a reliable indication of the users ' judgements of the pages ' user-friendliness. 2 Evaluating the usability of web page...|$|E
40|$|Aside {{from the}} fact that intra-organisational {{networks}} are centralised platforms and that information publishing is limited to selected employees, organisations find search satisfaction and <b>findability</b> to have reached an average level. As the purchase, development and the implementation of a search tool is an expensive investment for an organisation which strives to improve the organisational search satisfaction and intranet <b>findability,</b> improvement is desired. However, only a small amount of research has been done in the subject of intranets and academia appears to be more concerned with the public web rather than the intranets. This study has attempted to fill this void, by analysing how factors, correlated with organisational search satisfaction and intranet <b>findability,</b> vary over the time frame of three years. In this study we have analysed data provided by a company specialised in search solutions. The data were collected over three years in the form of annual surveys. Analysing this data we have formulated our research question to how specific factors impact the perceived organisational search satisfaction and intranet <b>findability</b> and how the impact changes over time. By limiting the research to the perception of search managers, a term including all roles who are in charge of maintaining the intranet search applications, this study was adapted to an organisational level. This means that the respondents in the surveys used in this study are not end-users but the manager of the search applications. In our conclusions, we present the number of employees, the use of taxonomy and key performance indicators as the three principal factors which create the most significant impact on organisational search satisfaction and intranet <b>findability</b> as well as how satisfaction and <b>findability</b> have varied over time...|$|E
