One of the aims of this work is to familiarize readers with the level and availability of the systems of public administration of the Slovak Republic, the concept data e-mailboxes and provides a comparison of this area with other countries. To meet this goal, I will use the available information about data repositories in Slovakia and abroad. The main objective of this work is to describe the situation chosen from the real world (which we can understand as a service) encountered by citizens in relation to the application of a data <b>e-mailbox</b> in Slovakia. This service is by modeling processes analyzed {{in order to determine the}} level of friendliness in relation to the user. The reader learns how to deal with if it wants to use the services associated with data e-mail. It will then be informed on what level the user interface and functionality of the services. Our experience is a proposal for improving data <b>e-mailbox</b> in Slovakia, given the lessons learned from the comparison with the countries of Germany and Sweden. Contribution of the work I see familiar readers with the level of data and application availability <b>e-mailbox</b> Slovak Republic. Slovak citizens obtain information how to deal with if it wants to use the services associated with data e-mail Slovakia, and last but not least, I can see the benefits for the Slovak Republic, which it can use Suggestions for improving data <b>e-mailbox</b> in the process of development of ICT in public administration and government...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have started analyzing e-mail archives {{of individuals and}} groups as an approximation of social ties. However {{it can be hard}} to obtain complete e-mail archives covering all exchanges between a group of individuals. Frequently, only <b>e-mailboxes</b> of a subset of the analyzed actors are available for analysis. In this project we report on some experiments to find the best ego networks (i. e. mailboxes) to give a “reasonably ” complete picture of the full social group network. We also report on the stability of social network metrics with respect to incomplete networks. We have collected the complete individual mailboxes over a period of 20 weeks of 53 researchers working in the same lab. Applying snowball sampling and subsequently adding more members of the group, we have compared a globally optimal selection strategy, adding the next-best member with respect to the chosen metric, a locally best strategy, adding the next best member within the already known network, and a random selection strategy. As sampling metrics, we used individual and group betweenness centrality, group density, number of nodes and edges, and others. Results show that good approximations of group network structures are already obtained with 25 % to 30 % of the mailboxes of the community. 1...|$|R
