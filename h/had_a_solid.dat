5|$|Although he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> {{performance}} in spring training, Hughes began the 2009 season in Triple-A. He was {{called up to}} the majors in April after Chien-Ming Wang {{was placed on the}} disabled list. Hughes made his first start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched six scoreless innings, earning his first win since 2007 in an 11–0 victory. On May 25, Hughes threw eight scoreless innings, earning the win in an 11–1 victory over the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in Webber's career the first race of the season was not held in Melbourne, but in Bahrain, due to the {{original}} date clashing with the Commonwealth Games. Webber qualified 7th and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> race to finish 6th and pick up 3 Championship points. Although Webber was considered by some to have the better race performance, this was generally overlooked when Rosberg set the fastest lap in his debut race and moved up through the field despite a first-lap incident.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{felt that}} Vick had not {{lived up to}} his {{potential}} during his four seasons with the team. Considering the team now <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and Bodie, and the Yankees needed pitching; Vick became expendable. On December15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, Muddy Ruel, Del Pratt and Hank Thormahlen to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Wally Schang and Mike McNally.|$|E
5|$|While Clinton <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> base {{of support}} in New York City, {{candidates}} and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{running back}} Chris Johnson {{finished}} {{the game with}} 223rushing yards, 32receiving yards, and 153return yards {{for a total of}} 408all-purpose yards. That mark broke the NCAA bowl record for all-purpose yards previously set by Alabama's Sherman Williams against Ohio State in the 1995 Citrus Bowl. On the basis of his record-setting performance, Johnson was named the game's Most Valuable Player. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Boise State tailback Jeremy Avery <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid,</b> if unspectacular, outing. He produced 69rushing yards, 43receiving yards, 41kick–return yards, and caught a 25–yard touchdown pass. Both Johnson and Avery received the Most Valuable Player award for their respective teams.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor, {{a position he}} held until his appointment as the school's second president in 1896. Hall <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. As president, Hall was noted for his aggressive fundraising and improvements to the school, including his special project, the A. French Textile School. In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first textile engineering school in the Southern United States, with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters. It named the A. French Textile School after its chief donor and supporter, Aaron S. French. The textile engineering program would move to the Harrison Hightower Textile Engineering Building in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In his {{professional}} debut, a preseason {{game against the}} Carolina Panthers, Cody <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> performance, finishing with five tackles (four solo). His most impressive play came in the first half, when he tackled DeAngelo Williams single-armed for a loss while holding off Panthers center Ryan Kalil with the other. On November 21, {{he made his first}} official start, debuting against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium. Unlike his preseason performance, he was criticized for his poor performance from fans and head coach John Harbaugh. During a play, the Panthers offensive lineman pushed Cody out of the way, allowing Mike Goodson to have a 45-yard run. Cody finished the game without any tackles, as the Ravens defense allowed 120 rushing yards. As a rookie in 2010, Cody played 13 games with 13 tackles.|$|E

5|$|On offense, the Hokies largely kept up {{with the}} Jayhawks, despite a losing effort. The two-quarterback system that had been heavily {{promoted}} heading into the game was largely abandoned {{in the first quarter}} after freshman Tyrod Taylor was sacked on his first twoplays and threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown during his second time on the field. After those two abortive first-quarter appearances, and a single play {{at the beginning of the}} second quarter, Taylor did not re-enter the game until a single play halfway through the fourth quarter. With Taylor largely removed from the game, junior Sean Glennon was left to fill the gaps. Glennon <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid,</b> if unspectacular, game, completing 13of his 28passes for 160yards and a touchdown. Glennon did struggle at times against the Jayhawks' defense, however, throwing two interceptions that resulted in 10Kansas points.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 season {{featured}} many strong individual {{performances by}} the Giants, especially on offense. Receiver Amani Toomer had a breakout season, accumulating over 1100yards receiving and six touchdowns. Fellow receiver Ike Hilliard also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> season, finishing {{just shy of}} 1000yards receiving on the year. Tight end Pete Mitchell contributed 58 receptions, and Tiki Barber emerged as a premiere pass-catching running back, catching 66 passes on the year. The defense was also solid, ranking 11th {{in the league and}} sending Armstead and Strahan to the Pro Bowl again. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 after 13 games, they lost their final three games of the season to miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season.|$|E

At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E

5|$|When artistic life in Paris resumed {{after the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider {{opportunities}} {{for the performance of}} his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet's student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet's wife, Geneviève; he and Meilhac <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach's operettas.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless {{he was not}} traded and the Rockets {{began the}} season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon {{improved}} his passing in 1992–93, setting a new career high of 3.5 assists per game. This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career high with 26.1 points per game. The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins, and advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59. The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season. In stark contrast to the previous year, the Rockets entered the 1993–94 season as a team on the rise. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> core of young players and veterans, with a leader in Olajuwon who was entering his prime.|$|E
