5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 <b>expedition</b> in which the entire <b>expedition</b> party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his <b>expedition</b> to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last <b>expedition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} an <b>expedition</b> to Brazil in 1915, for {{the purpose}} of capturing more birds for the zoo. This <b>expedition</b> was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the <b>expedition,</b> G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this <b>expedition,</b> Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This <b>expedition</b> marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} {{of support from the}} Royal Navy, the New England <b>expedition</b> set out in March 1745 for Louisbourg. More than 4,000 men on more than 90 {{transports}} (mainly fishing boats and coastal traders), escorted by six colonial guard ships, descended on Canso, where the <b>expedition</b> waited for the ice to clear from Gabarus Bay, the site just south of Louisbourg that had been chosen for the troop landing. Starting on 22 April the <b>expedition</b> was joined by four Royal Navy warships under the command of Commodore Warren, who received orders (issued in January, but not received until after his previous refusal) to assist the <b>expedition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Douglas Mawson had {{accompanied}} Ernest Shackleton's 1907–09 British Antarctic <b>Expedition.</b> Along with Edgeworth David and Alistair Mackay, {{he had been}} part of a man-hauled sledging <b>expedition,</b> the first to reach the area of the South Magnetic Pole. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the University of Adelaide. Despite an offer from Robert Falcon Scott to join his Terra Nova <b>Expedition</b> to reach the Geographic South Pole, Mawson began planning his own Antarctic <b>expedition.</b> Mawson's plan, which led to the Australasian Antarctic <b>Expedition,</b> envisaged three bases on the Antarctic continent, collectively surveying much of the coast directly south of Australia. He approached Shackleton, who not only approved of his plan but was prepared to lead the <b>expedition</b> himself. Although Shackleton withdrew from the <b>expedition</b> in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.|$|E

Although initially planning to travel independently, they decided to join a Norwegian <b>expedition</b> led by Hagbord Ekerold and accompanied by Swiss mountaineer and glaciologist Paul Louis Mercanton. The <b>expedition</b> set sail from Bratvaag aboard two ships in August 1921, and upon arriving at Jan Mayen they became {{the first team to}} successfully climb the Beerenberg. During the <b>expedition,</b> Lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by excavating at an abandoned Eskimo settlement.

5|$|In 1899, wealthy {{railroad}} magnate Edward Harriman {{arranged for}} a maritime <b>expedition</b> called the Harriman Alaska <b>Expedition</b> to Alaska comprising an elite community of scientists, artists, photographers, and naturalists to explore and document the Alaskan coast. The voyagers, spent two months traveling from Seattle, {{along the coast of}} Alaska, to Siberia, and back again. In many ways, the <b>expedition</b> was an intersection of 19th-century science and 20th-century science. The <b>expedition</b> claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science, including 38 new fossil species. They charted the geographic distribution of many species. They discovered an unmapped fiord and named several glaciers. John Muir and his friend Harriman who were members of this <b>expedition</b> were instrumental in governmental lobbying on National Park legislation says.

The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire <b>expedition</b> totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the <b>expedition</b> was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The <b>expedition</b> was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the <b>expedition</b> had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The <b>expedition</b> did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E
