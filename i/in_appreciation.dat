At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. <b>In</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the Transylvanian noblemen's services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes they had so far paid to the voivodes.|$|E
5|$|The author Sylvia Townsend Warner cited Murray's {{work on the}} witch-cult as an {{influence}} on her 1926 novel Lolly Willowes, and sent a copy of her book to Murray <b>in</b> <b>appreciation,</b> with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some difference in their depictions of the witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.|$|E
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón {{was hospitalized}} {{multiple}} times, the first being {{due to a}} fall that fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized even in European papers.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} rough cut of the film to {{determine}} what scenes would have music.

Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams.

5|$|Utbi, who was {{a helpful}} {{associate}} of Maymandi, praised him <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> for his support. According to 12th-century poet Nizami Aruzi, Maymandi had even attempted to back the later-to-be celebrated Persian poet Ferdowsi {{when he tried to}} obtain Mahmud's patronage for the Shahnameh, which would later become the national epic of Iran. Maymandi reportedly also backed the Iranian scholar al-Biruni against Mahmud, however this has been disputed. Abu Sahl Hamdawi, a man of letters and patron of poets, who served in high offices under the Ghaznavids, was originally a student of Maymandi.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Liberty Bell Savings Bonds {{drive in}} 1950, 55replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard. The bells were to be {{displayed}} and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited {{on the grounds of}} the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the service of the school's graduates. Walt Disney World has a replica of the Liberty Bell, which is located in Liberty Square in the Magic Kingdom. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual Liberty Bell in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. <b>In</b> <b>appreciation</b> for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} runs scored, this {{performance}} was soon surpassed. In the Third Test, at Headingley, Bradman scored {{a century before}} lunch on 11 July, {{the first day of}} the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney. In the afternoon, Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing the day on 309 not out. He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play. His eventual score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham. Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax. Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for £1,000 <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> of his achievement. The match ended in anti-climax as poor weather prevented a result, as it also did in the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} Empress Matilda, on {{her return to}} England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, {{and the necessity of}} joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was <b>in</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.|$|E
5|$|In November 2001, C and M {{squadron}} SBS had {{an extensive}} {{role in the}} invasion of Afghanistan {{at the start of}} the War in Afghanistan, notably, members of M squadron were involved in the Battle of Tora Bora. The SBS was integrated directly into Task Force Sword – a Black SOF, under direct command of JSOC, this was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Troops from C squadron (reinforced by teams from X and Z squadron, with at least one SEAL attached to them) were tasked with several missions, some with General Dostum's Northern Alliance forces at Mazar-e-Sharif. On November 10, C squadron inserted into the recently captured Bagram Airbase, which caused an immediate political quandary with the Northern Alliance leadership which claimed that the British had failed to consult them on it before the deployment, in addition to fighting with Dostum's forces, they worked alongside TF Sword in Shah-i-Kot Valley. Members of M squadron SBS, were involved in a prison revolt during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, members of the SBS along with US and Northern Alliance troops eventually quelled the uprising, however during one CAS mission, a misdirected JDAM bomb wounded 4 SBS personnel to various degrees. <b>In</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the SBS contribution to the battle, the CIA attempted to recognise the personnel with US decorations, but due to Military and political bureaucracy, the decorations were never awarded. The SBS continued to work with Task Force Sword and the CIA.|$|E
