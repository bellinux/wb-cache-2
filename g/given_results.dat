25|$|Evolutionary {{relationships}} of species within the genus Plasmodium have been controversial. Plasmodium species were originally divided by morphology, life-cycle characteristics, and host species. However, modern molecular approaches for determining evolutionary relationships have <b>given</b> <b>results</b> which conflict with older classification methods. Many attempts to clarify Plasmodium taxonomy with molecular methods have also run into technical challenges. Ribosomal RNA sequencing, {{which is often}} used in other organisms to determine evolutionary relationships, is challenging to interpret from Plasmodium species as they maintain several different copies of ribosomal RNA which are expressed {{at different stages of}} the life cycle and which may be able to recombine with one another. Another commonly used marker for evolutionary studies has been the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) which is present in all Plasmodium species. However, analyses of CSP sequences are {{complicated by the fact that}} the sequence of CSP, which is present on the surface of the parasite during infection, is under heavy selective pressure from the host immune system. This could potentially obscure relevant changes.|$|E

50|$|The {{results of}} the {{referendum}} approved the Constitution of 1980. However, the <b>given</b> <b>results</b> were objected to by the political opposition, headed by the ex-senator Patricio Aylwin and more than 46 others, arguing that this result did not tally with electoral records. One objection was that voters were only marked by ink on the thumb, which came off rapidly, making electoral fraud easy. These criticisms were rejected by the Scrutiny Association, and the Constitution was promulgated on 21 October 1980.|$|E

In the 1970s, not yet having discovered the fly pheromone, mass trapping tests were carried out using yellow traps, but this technique, requiring the placement of at least five traps per plant, was discarded as uneconomic, and had a strong negative impact on useful entomofauna.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, the {{building}} at No. 17 was demolished for safety reasons. There {{used to be an}} active squat in this building with a lot of interesting activity. It was a plot of 285m ² acquired by the city of Lyon in April 2004 for 315,000 €, on which were built garages and a two-floor building. It became an abandoned green space. The corresponding surface has been transformed into a concrete urban park. In October 2012, the artist JULIACKS did an intervention performance about this gated green space relating to the polemics of free space for art and culture in Lyon as part of the exhibition, CDD, at art space 360m3. The archaeological survey conducted in November 2007 had not <b>given</b> <b>results</b> leading to further excavations.

50|$|Late Archaic Period: Excavating {{deeper into}} the Late Rodgers layer (Lopinot et al. 1998:76), 1 to 2.5 ft below the surface, remains can be found of the Late Archaic period, dating from 2,500 to 5,500 years BP (CAR 2006). A number of lithic tools and points have been {{recovered}} from this period, including Sedalia complex points and knives of nonheat-treated Jefferson City chert. A midden deposit at 2.3 to 2.6 meters below the surface has yielded Williams Corner-Notched bifaces. Additional finds have included animal and plant remains, nutting stones, metates, faceted hematite, and stone tools of heat-treated Burlington chert. Uncorrected AMS dates have <b>given</b> <b>results</b> of 4020+/-80 years BP (Ray et al. 1998:77). Middle to Early Archaic Periods: Below the Late Archaic are Middle Archaic deposits extending {{to a depth of}} two meters. Little has been published covering a time period of 5,500 to 8,000 years BP (CAR 2006).|$|E

5000|$|A {{study in}} 2012 by Brisighelli [...] "et al." [...] stated that an {{analysis}} of ancestral informative markers [...] "as {{carried out in the}} present study indicated that Italy shows a very minor sub-Saharan African component that is, however, slightly higher than non-Mediterranean Europe." [...] Discussing African mtDNAs the study states that these indicate that a significant proportion of these lineages could have arrived in Italy more than 10,000 years ago; therefore, their presence in Europe does not necessarily date to the time of the Roman Empire, the Atlantic slave trade or to modern migration." [...] These mtDNAs by Brisighelli [...] "et al." [...] were reported with the <b>given</b> <b>results</b> as [...] "Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of African origin are mainly represented by haplogroups M1 (0.3%), U6 (0.8%) and L (1.2%)" [...] for the 583 samples tested. The haplogroups M1 and U6 can be considered to be of North African origin and could therefore be used to signal the documented African historical input. Haplogroup M1 was observed in only two carriers from Trapani (West Sicily), while U6 was observed only in Lucera, South Apulia, and another {{at the tip of the}} Peninsula (Calabria).|$|E
