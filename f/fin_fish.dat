500|$|Many {{types of}} aquatic animals {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "fish" [...] are not fish in the sense given above; examples include shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals, whales, amphibians, crocodiles, even hippopotamuses, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish. However, according to the definition above, all mammals, including cetaceans like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in aquaculture, the true fish are referred to as finfish (or <b>fin</b> <b>fish)</b> to distinguish them from these other animals.|$|E

Different species of krill are found in Falkland waters, with Lobster Krill inhabiting the warmer waters in the north.

[...] The squid spawn in the mouth of the Río de la Plata close to the confluence of the cold Falklands current and the warm Brazilian current, migrate southwards along the Patagonian Shelf into the Falklands waters and then return to their spawning grounds along that lies off the continental shelf.|$|E

In spite of the growing demand for the seed of cultivable brackish water <b>fin</b> <b>fishes</b> for aquaculture, the technology available on seed production is still laboratory oriented. Even though the culture of <b>fin</b> <b>fishes</b> such as mullets, pearlspot and milk fish is practised to a limited extent in the traditional systems, theemphasis is still on shrimp farming.

2500|$|Bony fish {{include the}} lobe-finned {{fish and the}} ray <b>finned</b> <b>fish.</b> The lobe-finned fish is the class of fleshy <b>finned</b> <b>fishes,</b> {{consisting}} of lungfish, and coelacanths. They are bony fish with fleshy, lobed paired fins, which are joined to the body by a single bone. These fins evolved into {{the legs of the}} first tetrapod land vertebrates, amphibians. Ray <b>finned</b> <b>fishes</b> are so-called because they possess lepidotrichia or [...] "fin rays", their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ("rays").|$|R
