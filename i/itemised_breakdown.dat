Most clients in the CI, if not all, award projects based on price {{and in most cases}} to the “cheapest bidder” and not the “safer bidder”. Consequently, such practices have compelled contractors to lower their bid price to increase their chances of being awarded projects, whereas in contrast, H&S is marginalised. The study, which was a case study of nine projects of which six were civil engineering projects and three building construction projects, was purposed to conceptualise a model for pricing H&S on construction projects. The findings showed that contractors do price for H&S using an <b>itemised</b> <b>breakdown</b> even though such items are not included as a trade in the Bill of Quantities (BOQs). With regards to expenditure, the actual costs of H&S ranged between 2. 9 % and 3. 98 % for projects with a value below R 500 million and between 4. 08 % and 4. 90 % for projects with a value above R 500 million. Health and safety costs were found to be directly proportional to the projects value and indirectly influenced by the client. Previous studies recommended that H&S should be priced as an itemised trade in the BOQs, but such recommendations are yet to be implemented. The lack of a conceptual model for pricing H&S on construction makes accurate and adequate monitoring of H&S costs unlikely. Thus, a standardised pricing model will assist contractors to price adequately for H&S, and clients, to ensure that provision for H&S measures on construction projects is adequate as required by the Construction Regulations (CR) 2014...|$|E
