40|$|A {{corporate}} financial/regulatory model, called FINREG, {{is presented}} to simulate a utility's accounting practices, financial policy and constraints, and ratemaking environment. For each year of simulation FINREG will yield as output electricity rates, pro-forma accounting statements, selected accounting ratios, and the accumulated present value of dividends less common stock offerings. The model is used to perform a financial evaluation of two feasible expansion options for Boston Edison Company. The two options are generated by OPTGEN, an MIT Energy Laboratory dynamic programming capacity expansion program. OPTGEN provides the capacity additions and annual fuel costs for each option. For the first plan, OPTGEN added an 800 MW <b>coal</b> <b>unit</b> in 1987 and a 250 MW <b>coal</b> <b>unit</b> in 1992 to the existing Boston Edison system. For the second, a 1000 MW nuclear unit was prespecified to begin operation in 1989, and OPTGEN added a 250 MW <b>coal</b> <b>unit</b> in 1987. Financial and regulatory assumptions were specified for each option. FINREG generated selected statistics for the two options through 1998. The equity value associated with each option is estimated.

For example, one study examined 11 states in the Midwest and projected that 18 percent of coal-fueled capacity in that region could retire.

40|$|Wind power {{introduces}} variability into {{electric power}} systems. Due {{to the physical}} characteristics of wind, most of this variability occurs at inter-hour time-scales and <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> are therefore technically capable of balancing wind. Operators of coal-fired units have raised concerns that additional cycling will be prohibitively costly. Using PJM bid-data, we observe that coal operators are likely systematically under-bidding their startup costs. We then consider {{the effects of a}} 20 % wind penetration scenario in the coal-heavy PJM West area, both when <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> bid business as usual startup costs, and when they bid costs accounting for the elevated wear and tear that occurs during cycling. We conclude that while 20 % wind leads to increased coal cycling and reduced coal capacity factors under business as usual startup costs, including full startup costs shifts the burden of balancing wind onto more flexible units. This shift has benefits for CO 2, NOX, and SO 2 emissions {{as well as for the}} profitability of coal plants, as calculated by our dispatch model...|$|R
40|$|The Clean Air Act {{requires}} the EPA to regulate {{carbon dioxide and}} greenhouse gases to protect public health and welfare. Currently the agency {{is in the process}} of developing standards for existing coal power plants under section 111 (d) of the CAA and are expected to issue the proposed rule this summer. These regulations have the potential to drastically reduce emissions in the United States. Of the policy proposals and recommendations that have been submitted to the EPA, most advocate for including flexibility mechanisms, such as emissions trading, crediting and offsets, in the guidance policy. However, such broad mechanisms have limited precedence under 111 (d) and their legality is untested. This paper explores a more conservative approach by regulating <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> within-the-fence-line. Specifically, the proposed policy would require uniform mandatory heat rate reductions for all <b>coal</b> <b>units,</b> regardless of initial heat rate. All <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> would be required to lower heat rates by 740 - 810 Btu/kWh, resulting in an 8 % fleet-wide average. Inefficient units would be allowed to continue to operate alongside more efficient ones as long as each reduces their heat rate by the given amount. The policy was modeled and this analysis finds that despite costs associated with installing heat-rate reducing technology, costs to plant operators and consumers are reduced. This is mainly due to the decreases in fuel costs that accompany the efficiency improvements. As a result, it is more economical for many coal plants to operate. US generation from coal increases 4 % relative to a reference and electricity prices per kWh decrease. Costs associated with the policy do force some <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> into retirement. An additional 4. 3 GW of coal capacity and 50 <b>coal</b> <b>units</b> are retired compared to the 4. 4 GW that are expected to retire absent any policy. However, the units that close operate at low or zero capacity and specific regions are not disproportionally affected over others. Carbon emissions are reduced by 68 megatons the first year that the policy goes into effect relative to the reference scenario and avoids 1, 284 Mt of cumulative carbon emission over the lifetime of the analysis (2016 - 2030). However, overall, the policy does not force any changes in electrical generation. No new low-carbon resources are built as a result of the policy. Therefore, total emissions continue to rise through the end of the analysis as the economy grows. Despite starting below 2005 levels, emissions increase to 4. 3 % above 2005 levels by 2030. Overall, the policy represents a less ambitious course of action to reduce carbon emissions from coal power plants but still allows reductions to take place at low economic costs and would likely stand up to challenges in court. While it is unlikely that the EPA will chose such a limited approach to regulating coal plants under 111 (d), the proposed policy could serve as a sound option if other alternatives fail...|$|R
