The concentration of sugars and organic acids and the daily course of CO 2 exchange in the florets, the flower stalk and the leaves of intact and cut <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> were determined. The concentration of sugars in florets <b>of</b> the cut <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> de-creased progressively and linearly to 25 % of the initial value. The concentration of organic acids in the <b>flower</b> stalk <b>of</b> the intact <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> increased progressivly, whereas the concentration of malic acid in the <b>flower</b> stalk <b>of</b> the cut cluster decreased. The levels of sugars and organic acids in leaves in the absence <b>of</b> a <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> was higher than those in leaves in the pressence of a cluster. The leaves and the <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> were related as source and sink organ, respectively.

As reported in preceding paper, cut flower quality {{was considered to}} be composed of (1) 2 ̆ 2 individual quality determinants 2 ̆ 2, such as plant height, size and number of leaves, stem diameter, number of branching, growth <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> and <b>flowering</b> time and (2) 2 ̆ 2 balancing (proportional, relative or correlative quality determinants 2 ̆ 2, such as ratio <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> to <b>flowering</b> stem length and allometric (relative) growth between <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> and <b>flowering</b> stem. There was a trend toward larger plant with wide spacings and with larger plants at planting. Mean <b>flowering</b> time <b>of</b> Kalanchoe, however, was retarded in wide spacings and with larger plants at planting time. In analysing the balancing quality <b>of</b> Kalanchoe cut <b>flower,</b> the idea <b>of</b> allometric growth between <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> and <b>flowering</b> stem was adopted, examining with a equation, y=bx^α, where y is the length <b>of</b> main <b>flower</b> <b>cluster,</b> x, the length <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> stem, b, initial growth index and α, relative growth coefficient.

40|$|The {{strategy}} of breeding of buckwheat in Russia is directed {{on the increase}} of potential efficiency and most complete use of nature-climatic resources of district (1). In the decision of these tasks, the important place can have use <b>of</b> green <b>flower</b> mutation. This mutation is of interest for breeding first of all {{in connection with the}} special durability of an attachment <b>of</b> fruits in <b>flowers</b> <b>cluster</b> and accordingly, in connection with prospect of creation of cultivars with high shedding resistance (2).

For the first time green flower mutation at buckwheat had been described by E. S. Alekseeva (3).

One time immersion treatment of the adequately thinned <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> with 100 ppm GA 3 at around full bloom, however, resulted {{in the formation of}} large-sized black berries of 8 - 11 g that stuck together.

However, once the <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> thinning was carried out so that the each of the clusters had about 70 flowers, fruit thinning was unnecessary because of ideal fruit set and growth rates after the GA 3 treatment <b>of</b> the thinned <b>flower</b> <b>clusters.</b> The berries ripened from late August to early September in field conditions, and the berry quality did not deteriorate on trees by October.

50|$|Though Psathyrostachys juncea {{can survive}} in harsh conditions, it {{is a hard}} species to {{initially}} plant, because the seeds {{must be in the}} correct conditions in order to begin germination. Psathyrostachys juncea has low seedling vigor, which affects the success of germination. But once P. juncea has begun germination, it can tolerate most harsh weather conditions. In recent years, scientists have explored possible solutions to improving seedling vigor. One possible technique to increasing seedling vigor is increasing ploidy. In nature, P. juncea are diploids, however, tetraploid germplasm have been show to increase seed size and seedling vigor in P. juncea. Regeneration of this species has been successful, meaning that scientists can more easily select for specific traits and manipulate P. juncea at the cellular level. Thus, humans can easily induce tetraploidy in P. juncea. As a result, breeding programs have begun to grow tetraploid cultivars so as to increase the success of P. juncea germination. There is a small change in tissue quality and nutrition content with different ploidy levels, but nothing significant. Therefore, increasing tetraploid cultivars is a possible avenue for improving seed quality. Path analysis has been conducted to examine what exactly effects seed yield. Fertile, strong stems (tillers), the number <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> (florets) per <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> (spikelet), and seed weight all showed positive relationships with seed yield. That is, P. juncea with more stems/tillers, more flowers, and/or heavier seeds have improved seed yield. However, the number <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> (spikelet) per stem and number <b>of</b> seeds per <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> were negatively correlated with seed yield. Thus, having more <b>flowers</b> on a <b>cluster,</b> not more seeds per cluster, increasing seed yield. This information can be used to improve breeding programs for P. juncea. In addition, water stress also improves leaf and inflorescence tissue quality, while nitrogen rich fertilizer improves leaf, stem, and inflorescence tissue quality. Increased tissue quality is related to improvements in total yield.|$|R

40|$|The tomato is {{an annual}} that {{requires}} about 100 - 150 days {{to complete a}} seed to seed life cycle. Seed germination Seed of most varieties germinate at an optimum temperature range of 26 - 32 °. Under optimal conditions seedlings break through the soil surface about four days after sowing. Seed sowing depth should be about 1 - 2 cm. Shoot Development After emergence, the cotyledons expand rapidly and the first true leaves develop at the growing point. Leaves grow alternately (2 / 5 phyllotaxy). Most varieties develop 7 - 11 leaves below the first inflorescence. After the first cluster, indeterminate varieties typically develop three leaves between <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> and six or more <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> on a single branch. Determinate types usually show two leaves between <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> and up to 5 clusters per branch.
