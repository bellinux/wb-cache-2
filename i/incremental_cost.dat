5|$|In April 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have been spent on procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. The GAO stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the processes {{used by the}} Navy and the Air Force for identifying <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the aircraft platforms used {{in support of the}} Noble Anvil campaign, which highlighted the bombing of Kosovo. Examination of these methods was done to determine if the Navy was able to properly and completely capture <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> to receive full reimbursement from the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF). The thesis begins with an overview of the OCOTF and its intended purpose, and continues with an in depth analysis of the processes implemented by both services to identify and report <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> for aircraft platforms to OSD. It further compares the methodologies, highlighting the advantages and pitfalls of each, and assesses the possibility of lost funding to the Navy based on the processes employed. This research concludes that the Navy did not suffer any loss of funds based on inequity in disbursements from the OCOTF based on the methodologies it exercised. However, key factors which potentially prevented greater reimbursement were identified to be: 1) The interpretation of vague guidance for determining <b>incremental</b> <b>costs,</b> 2) Poor record-keeping and accountability of operational missions flown, 3) The use of different methodologies for capturing <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> by both services and within the Navy, and 4) The impact of the Navy's forward deployed status on <b>incremental</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm (DS/DS) {{presented}} unique {{challenges for}} estimating {{the cost of}} that conflict. This analysis reviews the cost estimates and methodologies developed for that purpose by DoD, CBO and GAO. It considers the budget climate and the role of foreign cash and in-kind contributions. Finally, it reviews the budgeting innovations used to provide and monitor DS/DS defense spending. At the outset of the crisis, costs were estimated to determine the defense funding requirements for DS/DS. Because of the specific provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, these estimates focused on the incremental impact on DoD's budget. This was difficult because <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> were not defined and DoD's accounting structure does not measure <b>incremental</b> <b>costs.</b> As allied financial support for U. S. defense expenditures increased, cost estimates were also used to measure the relative contributions of donor countries. This led to debates over the proper definition of <b>incremental</b> <b>costs.</b> Comparing the DS/DS cost estimates and the foreign cash and in-kind contributions, it appears that foreign contributions will cover DoD's <b>incremental</b> budgetary <b>costs,</b> but not the total <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> of the war.

25|$|The most {{expensive}} {{part of a}} CD is the jewel case. In 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD. Wholesale cost of CDs was $0.75 to $1.15, which retailed for $16.98. On average, the store received 35 percent of the retail price, the record company 27 percent, the artist 16 percent, the manufacturer 13 percent, and the distributor 9 percent. When 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs were introduced, each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded, even though the cost to produce the media was reduced. This was done because the apparent value increased. This continued from vinyl to CDs but was broken when Apple marketed MP3s for $0.99, and albums for $9.99. The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> though, to produce an MP3 is very small.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} 2013-14, The plant load factor (PLF) of {{coal-fired}} thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity {{demand in the}} country. The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in domestic sector. The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of generating additional electricity is only their coal fuel cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers {{who are willing to}} surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free electricity connection and subsidised electricity tariff.|$|E

40|$|A {{situation}} is analysed {{in which two}} countries negotiate the financing of the <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> which accrue {{if one of them}} switches from a non-sustainable onto a sustainable development path. The other country's incentive to pay arises as it benefits from the developing country's environmental resources, but at an ever declining rate as long as development remains non-sustainable. The paper shows that such negotiations induce a redistribution of income in favour of the developing country which in general will exceed <b>incremental</b> <b>costs.</b> The paper also derives conditions under which the developing country has an incentive to get on a 'less' sustainable path in the pre-agreement phase. In an application to the protection of tropical rainforests as carbon sinks it is shown that North to South redistribution of welfare would indeed be substantial. However, despite these transfer payments in excess of <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> the North would still gain enomously in efficiency terms from the use of the carbon sink option. (orig.)
