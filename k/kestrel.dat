40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{population}} to respond to climate change will depend on phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, or both. Bird populations have already responded to warming temperatures by shifting their distributions, adjusting migration distance and timing, and breeding earlier. A population of American <b>kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius) in southwestern Idaho has advanced its nesting by approximately 30 days, on average, in the last 30 years {{and this has been}} correlated with changes in winter climate. The mechanisms allowing for this shift, however, are not clearly understood. I investigated if assortative mating of wintering <b>kestrels</b> and non-wintering <b>kestrels</b> is accompanying to this shift by monitoring <b>kestrels</b> in the winter and breeding seasons from 2010 - 2013. I asked if 1) wintering <b>kestrels</b> nest earlier than non-wintering <b>kestrels,</b> 2) wintering <b>kestrels</b> tend to mate with wintering <b>kestrels</b> and non-wintering <b>kestrels</b> mate with non-wintering <b>kestrels,</b> and 3) early breeding <b>kestrels</b> are genetically differentiated from late breeding <b>kestrels.</b> Results indicate that wintering <b>kestrels</b> nest earlier than non-wintering <b>kestrels</b> but this effect varies across years. Wintering strategy of females significantly predicted the wintering strategy of its mate which provides evidence for assortative mating. Analysis of 6 polymorphic microsatellite loci, however, gave no evidence of genetic differentiation or genetic structure between early and late breeding <b>kestrels.</b> This could be because there is still mixing between the groups despite differences in phenology, or the assortative mating pattern has arisen too recently to have resulted in genetic differentiation. Overall, this study documents that there are carryover effects of wintering strategy on the timing of nest initiation and mate pairing in American <b>kestrels.</b> It provides evidence for assortative mating of <b>kestrels</b> by wintering strategy, but this assortative mating has not lead to genetic divergence in <b>kestrels</b> of southwestern Idaho at this time...|$|R
5|$|Since American <b>kestrels</b> are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild <b>kestrels</b> are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of <b>kestrels,</b> the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, <b>kestrels</b> that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American <b>kestrels.</b>|$|R

On 7 March 1964, XS688 became the first <b>Kestrel</b> to conduct its maiden flight, flown by Bill Bedford. The <b>Kestrel</b> had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early P.1127s, and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15,000lbf (85kN) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127/Kestrel prototype XP984, in addition to some other changes, such as addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and assorted operational equipment in a bay house within the rear fuselage.

40|$|Pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) were {{collected}} from pesticide-treated orchards in New York (USA) and fed to three captive American <b>kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius) for 60 days to evaluate potential hazards from soil-borne persistent insecticides. Three control <b>kestrels</b> were fed uncontaminated laboratory mice (Mus musculus). The pine voles contained an average of 38 ppm lead, 48 ppm DDE and 1. 2 ppm dieldrin (wet weight). The <b>kestrels</b> accumulated sublethal amounts of lead (1 ppm lead wet weight) in their livers. In contrast, DDE and dieldrin accumulated in the tissues and brains of <b>kestrels</b> to toxicologically significant concentrations. Control <b>kestrels</b> remained healthy and accumulated insignificant concentrations of the contaminants. The results indicated raptors may not be significantly at risk from lead residues in soil and biota following field applications of lead arsenate. However, sublethal effects may be expected from the level of contamination by organochlorine pesticides...|$|R
500|$|American <b>kestrels</b> do not train {{so easily}} as some larger falcons (particularly the Peregrine falcon) {{in the art}} of [...] "waiting on" [...] to perform a diving stoop on flushed prey. [...] However, some {{individual}} <b>kestrels</b> do master this skill. [...] Falconers sometimes train them to climb to a stooping position with tidbids on kites or balloons that the <b>kestrels</b> learn to climb after. [...] More common hunting techniques are to [...] "slip" [...] them after spotted game from the fist, or to release them from a vehicle window close to spotted quarry. [...] These techniques are more of a natural fit to the <b>kestrel's</b> ambushing methods in the wild.|$|R
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. <b>Kestrel</b> metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. <b>Kestrel</b> metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and <b>Kestrel</b> series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The <b>Kestrel</b> became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E

40|$|Birds nest under {{electric}} and magnetic fields (EMFs) generated by transmission liners which may affect their reproductive success and/or melatonin governing their circadian and circannual cycles. Over two years, captive <b>kestrels</b> {{were used to}} determine whether EMFs affect their plasma melatonin concentrations and their reproductive success. EMFs were equivalent to that which wild <b>kestrels</b> are exposed to while nesting under 735 kV transmission fines, and daily exposure used in the captive study (88 [...] 98 % time budget) was potentially equivalent to that of wild <b>kestrels</b> (90 % X, 80 % X). Captive <b>kestrels</b> were housed in control or EMF conditions to determine short-term (one season; S-EMF) and longer-term EMF (two seasons; L-EMF) effects. Plasma melatonin in adult EMF males was suppressed at 42 d and elevated at 70 d of EMF exposure compared to controls. Melatonin levels in EMF males at mid-season were similar to controls at season's end, suggesting a seasonal phase-shift. Melatonin was suppressed in L-EMF fledgling birds but not in adult females or nudes (1995) at 70 d. Plasm melatonin, higher in adult males than females at 70 d post-pairing, was not directly associated with body mass changes in <b>kestrels.</b> Captive EMF birds were more active and alert but groomed less often than controls. EMF exposure affected reproductive success of <b>kestrels.</b> Fertility and fledging success were higher, and hatching success lower in S-EMF clutches. Hatching success was higher, but fledging success lower in L-EMF clutches. In S-EMF clutches, mean egg volume and mass were greater, eggs had slightly more albumen but thinner eggshells, and embryos were larger than controls. L-EMF hatchlings were heavier than controls. The melatonin results for male <b>kestrels</b> indicate that <b>kestrels</b> perceive EMFs as light, thus altering their photoperiod. Photoperiodic manipulations advance molt onset, which is associated with increased body mass in male <b>kestrels.</b> S-EMF males were heavier at 56 d of exposure when molt began, but this was unlikely related to feed intake winch was unchanged. EMF exposure had no effect on body mass and pectoral muscle scores of reproducing females. The sexually-dimorphic response in body mass and melatonin concentrations suggests that male <b>kestrels</b> may be more sensitive to EMF exposure than females...|$|R

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The <b>kestrel</b> has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The <b>kestrel</b> is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

5|$|American <b>kestrels</b> are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations.
