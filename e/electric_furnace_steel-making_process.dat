40|$|Electric arc is a {{discharge}} phenomenon {{caused by}} particular electrical events and arc produced facilities in power system, {{for example the}} occurrence of short-circuit fault in feeders {{and the use of}} <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnace</b> for <b>steel-making.</b> All of these electric arcs have a highly nonlinear nature and can be considered as a significant source of power quality problems. To investigate the impacts of the electric arcs on power quality studies the development of the electric arc models for simulation analysis is became necessary. This paper thus presents the use of different one-dimensional interpolation methods for modelling the alternating current electric arc. The performances of different methods are compared by simulation results that are derived from the modelling of an alternating current <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnace</b> load and a low-frequency fluorescent tube...|$|R

Setting up an {{adaptable}} {{and flexible}} simulation model for <b>steel-making</b> <b>process</b> {{is very important}} to improve production system design and manufacture automation. To assist the decision-makers in steel-making plants, the Logistical simulator for steel-making has been developed using em-Plant software. The Simulator can be used to rapidly model any steel plant, including the movement of the operation equipments and the changes of production parameters. With the help of Simulator, the influences of lay-out changes, process parameters, and changes in planning could be revealed vividly, and the realistic production planning could be created. Results include production Gantt charts, display of cranes track, utilization figures and production statistics. Simulation cases show that the simulator is valid for simulating different <b>steel-making</b> <b>processes,</b> and production states on different conditions can be investigated by using this model...|$|R
