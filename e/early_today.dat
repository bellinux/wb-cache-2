25|$|In 1999, NBC {{canceled}} Sunrise {{and replaced}} it with a new program titled <b>Early</b> <b>Today,</b> which was originally produced by CNBC, and focused on business and financial news before switching to a general news format under the same production staff as MSNBC's First Look in 2004. <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> continues to air on the network, airing live each weekday morning at 4:00a.m. Eastern Time (with an updated telecast for viewers in the Pacific Time Zone), and on tape delay until 10:00a.m. Eastern – corresponding with the start time of Today in the Pacific Time Zone – to allow for adjustment in airtimes for other time zones and for certain NBC stations without a local morning newscast to air <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> in lieu of one.|$|E

25|$|The first brand {{extension}} of Today {{was created in}} 1982. The early morning news program <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> was conceived as a lead-in for Today, featuring the same anchors as the main program at the time, Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley. The half-hour program was fed twice to allow affiliates to carry one or both broadcasts. NBC canceled the program after a year, {{and replaced it with}} NBC News at Sunrise, originally anchored by Connie Chung.|$|E

25|$|News {{coverage}} {{has long been}} an important part of NBC's operations and public image, dating to the network's radio days. Notable NBC News productions past and present include Today, NBC Nightly News (and its immediate predecessor, the Huntley-Brinkley Report), Meet the Press (which has the distinction of the longest continuously running program in the history of American television), Dateline NBC, <b>Early</b> <b>Today,</b> NBC News at Sunrise, NBC Nightside and Rock Center with Brian Williams.|$|E
25|$|WTHR {{clears the}} {{majority}} of the NBC network schedule, {{with the exception of the}} second hour of the Saturday edition of Today and the early morning newscast <b>Early</b> <b>Today,</b> which air instead on WALV-CD/WTHR-DT2 (the latter program moved to that station on February 24, 2014, due to the expansion of its weekday morning newscast). Syndicated programs broadcast by WTHR include The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Dr. Oz Show, Dr. Phil, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune (the latter two game shows both moved to WTHR in 2002, after airing for more than a decade on WISH-TV).|$|E

In the Philippines, Jack TV (owned by Solar Entertainment) airs Will & Grace and Saturday Night Live, while TalkTV airs The Tonight Show and NBC News programs including the weekday and weekend editions of Today, <b>Early</b> <b>Today,</b> Dateline NBC and NBC Nightly News. Solar TV formerly broadcast The Jay Leno Show from 2009 to 2010.

25|$|The {{graphics}} {{were also}} overhauled with {{introduction of the}} new set (a slightly modified version of this package and the revised logo debuted on <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> that November, further integrating the early-morning news program's branding with Today). The logo-to-peacock animation was moved from the left corner to the bottom right side corner of the screen. The logo that was first previewed on September 13, 2013, pared down the number of circular arches from five to three with its coloring switching from different variations – generally shades of red, orange and yellow to depict a sunrise – to entirely orange.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, NBC {{canceled}} Sunrise {{and created}} two brand extensions for Today. One was <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> (not {{to be confused}} with the earlier incarnation); the program originally was produced by CNBC and focused on business and financial news before switching to general news under the same production staff as MSNBC First Look; it continues to air on many NBC affiliates. Also in the fall of 1999, Later Today, a talk show that was intended to air immediately following the then two-hour Today, was launched with hosts Jodi Applegate, Florence Henderson and Asha Blake. Sagging ratings for that show caused its cancellation in August 2000; it was replaced two months later by the current third hour of Today.|$|E
25|$|Daytime {{programming}} is also provided weekdays between 12:00 and 3:00p.m. {{in the form}} of the one-hour weekday soap opera Days of Our Lives (the scheduling of the program varies depending on the station, although it is initially fed to affiliates at 1:00p.m. Eastern). NBC News programming includes the morning news/interview program Today from 7:00–11:00a.m. weekdays, 7:00–9:00 on Saturdays and 7:00–8:00 on Sundays; nightly editions of NBC Nightly News (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's time slot), the Sunday political talk show Meet the Press, weekday early-morning news program <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> and newsmagazine Dateline NBC. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers and Last Call with Carson Daly, weeknight replays of the fourth hour of Today and CNBC program Mad Money, and the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, and the LXTV-produced 1st Look and Open House NYC on Saturdays (replays of the previous week's 1st Look also air on Friday late nights on most stations).|$|E

25|$|As an NBC owned-and-operated station, KXAS {{differs from}} many network-owned {{stations}} {{in that it}} does not carry its associated network's complete programming schedule. The station currently does not clear NBC's weekday overnight lineup, opting instead to air syndicated programming after Last Call with Carson Daly; it has never cleared the network's broadcast of CNBC's Mad Money during NBC's carriage of the program from September 2012 until the network replaced it with an extended rolling block of <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> in September 2017, although it did air the rebroadcast of the fourth hour of Today from its addition to the overnight block in September 2011 until September 2015. In addition, KXAS also airs The More You Know educational block on a one-hour delay due to the 9:00a.m. hour of its Saturday morning newscast (which itself airs as a split two-hour format bookending the Saturday edition of Today), resulting in the third hour of the block being shifted to Sundays whenever network sports telecasts are scheduled on Saturdays during the noon hour or earlier in order to meet FCC educational programming quotas.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 1999, {{as part of}} a shakeup of the network's daytime {{and early}} morning {{schedules}} (in which NBC also cancelled NBC News at Sunrise – with newcomer <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> replacing it as the network's early-morning newscast – and picked up the daytime talk show Later Today, a short-lived spinoff of Today), NBC announced that it would not renew Another World, ending the series' run after 35 years once the show's previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for Another World cancellation, one of the more notable events occurred in the summer of 1998: the network's San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) – at the time one of NBC's highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether, leaving Days of Our Lives and Sunset Beach as the only NBC soaps that the station cleared on its schedule; the move resulted in Another World being unavailable in around two million television households within the large San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, resulting in additional erosion of the program's already below-mediocre ratings (it was later picked up by smaller independent station KICU-TV).|$|E

2500|$|In March 2012, {{the program}} {{became a part}} of what was {{formerly}} branded as NBC All Night in the nominal 3:07a.m. ET/2:07a.m. timeslot on weeknights, replacing week-delayed repeats of NBC's late night talk shows. In that form, only the video for the program was presented on a [...] screen with gray branded windowboxing and pillarboxing, with all enhanced business information, including the CNBC Ticker, removed. The continuing movement of morning local newscasts, and with it <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> further into {{what is known as the}} graveyard slot eventually began to interfere with the airing of Mad Money in this late slot, especially if they aired at 4a.m., especially in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (meaning seven minutes would have to be cut-off Mad Money to fit in <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> and a local newscast starting at 4:30a.m.). On July 31, 2017, <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> began to first record at 3:00a.m. ET, and without any room on the schedule, the NBC version of Mad Money was discontinued on this date.|$|E
