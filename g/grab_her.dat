5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> dorsum.

Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided {{to take a closer look}} at her and tried to <b>grab</b> <b>her.</b> Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E
25|$|Polly and Digory <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> and put {{on their}} rings to take her out of their world, {{dragging}} with them Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank's horse, since all were touching one another when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to Charn. Instead they stumble into a dark void that Jadis recognises as a world not yet created. They then all witness {{the creation of a}} new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. Jadis, as terrified by his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. Jadis flees.|$|E

But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a portable toilet ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the tone of his work.

I saw a grown woman <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back".

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé tells her ex-lover that, {{as he did}} not attempt to make things more {{permanent}} when he had the chance, he has no reason to complain now that she has found someone else. On the bridge, she affirms that she wants her new love interest [...] "to make like a prince and <b>grab</b> <b>her,</b> delivering her to 'a destiny, to infinity and beyond" [...] while [...] "Prince Charming is left standing there like the second lead in a romantic comedy". Towards the end of the song, Beyoncé takes a more aggressive vocal approach and employs a middle eight as she sings, [...] "And like a ghost I'll be gone". When she chants the chorus for the third and final time, her vocals are omnipresent within layers of music, as described by Frannie Kelley of NPR. An electronic swoop tugs in continuously until the song ends.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{script is}} also {{thought to have}} been {{inspired}} by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; his daughter Jennifer had been born with [...] "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, inspiring the bleak urban backdrop of Eraserhead. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back".

500|$|The Doctor, Amy, Rory, and Gibbis regroup, and the Doctor surmises {{that the}} other three {{believed}} {{in some form of}} faith. The hotel and its rooms were, by design, meant to challenge their [...] "faith" [...] by fear to allow the beast to possess them. The Doctor identifies that Gibbis has survived due to the extreme cowardice of his species, while Rory lacks any such [...] "faith" [...] to be broken. However, the Doctor realises that it is Amy's trust in him that is being challenged; it is that faith that brought them to the hotel in the first place. Amy soon becomes possessed like the others. As the beast comes for Amy, the Doctor and the others <b>grab</b> <b>her</b> and take her to the room she opened previously. Inside, they find the illusion of young Amy, Amelia, still waiting for the return of her [...] "raggedy Doctor" [...] ("The Eleventh Hour"). The Doctor asserts to Amy that he is [...] "not a hero" [...] but [...] "just a mad man with a box" [...] to break her blind trust in him; once this is done, the beast outside the door collapses on the floor.|$|E
