2500|$|Brown {{did in fact}} punch a producer, {{knocking}} him down, {{but no one can}} say which producer it was. Some writers say it was David O. Selznick, who fired him in anger over script changes for A Star is Born (an adaptation of What Price Hollywood). In Sixty Years of Hollywood, John Baxter (author) [...] asserts the victim was the producer of The Devil is a Sissy and resulted in Brown's being replaced as director of the film. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> Brown's having punched a producer; {{the question is whether the}} punch was career-ending.|$|E
2500|$|From 1895, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{first-class}} status {{because of}} the official definition. The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, {{although there has been}} hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947. Status of limited overs matches, which began in 1963, is governed by the official List A categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major Twenty 20 matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage {{of the total number of}} matches recorded. Apart from one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930–31, all the [...] "disputed" [...] matches took place in England before 1895: see Variations in published cricket statistics for further information.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} about {{the outcome of the}} vote issued on 14 March, Crabb explained: [...] "What this actually means is that those individuals who are considered {{to be able to work}} in the future will now access the same level of benefit as those on Jobseekers Allowance, but will be given better tailored support to help them into employment. It doesn't affect those already claiming ESA. Of course we are protecting those that are 'too ill to work'. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] Three days later, Crabb claimed on his Facebook page that [...] "only those who are fit to work and actively seeking work are included in the work-related activity group". His post had to be amended: the work-related activity group contains ESA claimants deemed 'too ill to work' but capable of participating in work-related activities, such as job-coaching and pre-employment training, who are assessed as likely to work within two years, not immediately.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{increasing}} international profile the boycott was garnering {{in the world}} press, the contest went ahead in Nigeria after being rescheduled to avoid taking place during Ramadan, with many prominent nations sending delegates. Osmel Sousa of Venezuela, one of the world's most influential national directors, famously said [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it (the participation of Miss Venezuela in the contest)." [...] The trouble did not end there, however. A ThisDay (Lagos, Nigeria) newspaper editorial suggesting that Muhammad would probably have chosen one of his wives from among the contestants had he been alive to see it, resulted in inter-religious riots that started on 22 November in which over 200 {{people were killed in}} the city of Kaduna, along with many houses of worship being burned by religious zealots. Because of these riots, the 2002 pageant was moved to London, following widely circulated reports that the representatives of Canada and Korea had withdrawn from the contest and returned to their respective countries out of safety concerns. A fatwa urging the beheading of the woman who wrote the offending words, Isioma Daniel, was issued in Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities. Upon the pageant's return to England, many of the boycotting contestants chose to attend, including Miss Norway, Kathrine Sørland, who was ironically tipped {{in the last few days}} as the number one favourite for the crown she had previously boycotted.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{leaving the}} {{children}} in beggary," [...] said Grandcourt, still in his low voice. [...] "I advise you not to say things that you will repent of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know he is}} good, Barbara; and as for truth, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it, {{because he}} has {{never said a word}} to me that he might not say to any girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that: she <b>is</b> beautiful, and {{her beauty}} is {{of a high}} class. I admire her much more than all her sisters. She has a grander mien." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{credit of}} saving the child belongs to you, Seth," [...] Mr. Fernald said, decidedly, [...] "and I hope there'll <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> its being given. Tell us {{how it was}} done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So we are. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> our knowing {{more than}} men do," [...] replied the King, proudly. [...] "But we employ our wisdom to do good, instead of harm; so that horrid Aesop {{did not know what}} he was talking about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{doubt whether}} we should have ever taken her {{if she had not}} been so deep in the water with the guns and stores she had on board. The French {{certainly}} know how to build ships; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that. I doubt whether we have such a good-looking gun-boat in the service. Anyhow I have not seen one." ...|$|E
60|$|When he {{came back}} a later post had arrived, {{bringing}} the news of Constance's successes and of the invitation to her to share the expedition of her uncle and aunt. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> letting her go, but the feeling was scarcely of congratulation.|$|R
6000|$|... "The care of Ruth Lalonde is upon my shoulders," [...] he insisted. [...] "There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that. From {{me it is}} not charity, for {{she shared}} her meals with me when I was {{practically}} starving. I am {{going to ask you}} more questions." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1885 Series {{ended in}} dispute {{and with no}} clear resolution. Both clubs faced each other again in 1886, and this time around there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the outcome, with the Browns winning the Series 4 games to 2. This marked the only AA win in the 19th Century World Series contests.|$|R
60|$|That is {{a slight}} touch; he has not gone to Ætna nor Pelorus for fuel; but we shall not soon recover from it--he has taken our breath away and leaves us gasping. No smoke nor cinders there. Pure, white, hurtling, formless flame; very fire crystal, we cannot make spires nor waves of it, nor divide it, nor walk on it, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{singeing}} soles of feet. It is lambent annihilation.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Eddy {{has noted}} this {{disastrous}} result of preaching, and has {{put up the}} bars. She will have no preaching in her Church. She has explained all essential Scriptures, and set the explanations down in her book. In her belief her underlings cannot improve upon those explanations, and in that stern sentence [...] "they shall make no explanatory remarks" [...] she has barred them for all time from trying. She will be obeyed; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the man {{having been}} murdered," [...] the doctor said, {{and even his}} voice shook a little. [...] "His own hand could never have driven that knife home. I can tell you, even, how it was done. The man who stabbed him was in the {{compartment}} behind there, leaned over, and drove this thing down, just missing the shoulder. There was no struggle or fight of any sort. It was a diabolical deed!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Drusus married Aemilia Lepida around AD 29. She was the {{daughter}} of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, his second cousin. Tacitus reports that during their marriage [...] "she had pursued her husband with ceaseless accusations". In 36, she was charged with adultery with a slave and committed suicide, [...] "since there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> her guilt".|$|R
60|$|Some natures {{are better}} than others. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that. Some dispositions are born {{moderately}} sweet, others are born slightly sour. If you doubt the fact, reader, go study Nature, or get you to an argumentative friend and dispute the point. We refuse flatly {{to enter into a}} discussion of the subject.|$|R
2500|$|Springer {{has been}} sighted each year with her pod. [...] "Springer is in {{excellent}} condition," [...] reported Dr. Spong in an OrcaLab press release. [...] "There can now <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{the success of}} the return project as it is clear that Springer has resumed living a normal social life among her kin and community." ...|$|R
60|$|Evidently {{there is}} {{abundant}} fascination about this 'sport' for such as {{have had a}} degree of familiarity with it. I never saw people enjoy anything more than this gathering enjoyed this fight. The case was the same with old gray-heads and with boys of ten. They lost themselves in frenzies of delight. The 'cocking-main' is an inhuman sort of entertainment, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that; still, it seems a much more respectable and far less cruel sport than fox-hunting--for the cocks like it; they experience, as well as confer enjoyment; {{which is not the}} fox's case.|$|E
60|$|They all {{achieve some}} cures, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it; and the Faith Cure and the Prayer Cure {{probably}} {{do no harm}} when they do no good, since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment {{through the application of}} their mental forces alone. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has the look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{may have}} been the cause, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the fact that, from the time Hannibal and his army got {{possession}} of their comfortable quarters in Capua, the Carthaginian power began gradually to decline. As Hannibal determined to make that city the Italian capital instead of Rome, he, of course, when established there, felt in some degree settled and at home, and was less interested than he had been in plans for attacking the ancient capital. Still, the war went on; many battles were fought, many cities were besieged, the Roman power gaining ground all the time, though not, however, by any very decisive victories.|$|E
60|$|The Magistrate was doubtful, Mr. Uncommercial Traveller, {{whether this}} charge could be entertained. It was not known. Mr. Uncommercial Traveller {{replied that he}} wished it were better known, and that, if he could afford the leisure, he would use his {{endeavours}} to make it so. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it, however, he contended. Here was the clause.|$|R
60|$|Presently we {{arranged}} {{ourselves in}} military order, Natal Carabineers and Imperial Light Horse riding {{two and two}} abreast so that there might <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> precedence, and with Gough, the youngest regimental commander in the army, {{and one of the}} best, {{at the head of the}} column, we forded the Klip River and rode into the town.|$|R
60|$|Recognizing at {{once that}} the voice they had just heard {{did not belong to}} the man for whom they were looking the rioters {{remained}} silent with surprise, and during this short interval Sam brought the butt of his gun to the floor with unnecessary force in order that there might <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> his being armed.|$|R
60|$|They all {{achieve some}} cures, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it; and the Faith Cure and the Prayer Cure {{probably}} {{do no harm}} when they do no good, since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment {{through the application of}} their mental forces alone. They claim ability to cure malignant cancer, and other affections which have never been cured {{in the history of the}} race. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has the look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed.|$|E
6000|$|The {{time should}} be past for the mental attitude: [...] "Revolution is atrocious. Sir, there is no revolution." [...] Likewise should the time be past for that other {{familiar}} attitude: [...] "Socialism is slavery. Sir, it will never be." [...] It {{is no longer a}} question of dialectics, theories, and dreams. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it. The revolution is a fact. It is here now. Seven million revolutionists, organized, working day and night, are preaching the revolution--that passionate gospel, the Brotherhood of Man. Not only is it a cold-blooded economic propaganda, but it is in essence a religious propaganda with a fervour in it of Paul and Christ. The capitalist class has been indicted. It has failed in its management and its management is to be taken away from it. Seven million men of the working-class say {{that they are going to}} get the rest of the working-class to join with them and take the management away. The revolution is here, now. Stop it who can.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Geoffrey," [...] Gerald said as {{they sat}} {{together}} that evening at a comfortable inn, [...] "we must talk over matters here. We have five hundred crowns apiece, and need not trouble any longer as to how we are to support life. Your great object, of course, is {{to get out of}} this country somehow, and to make your way back to England. My first is to see Inez and find out whether she will follow my fortunes or remain to become some day Marchesa of Sottomayor. If she adopts the former alternative I have to arrange some plan to carry her off and to get out of the country, an operation in which I foresee no little difficulty. Of course if we are caught my life is forfeited, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that. The question for us to consider is how we are to set about to carry out our respective plans." ...|$|E
60|$|But these passing anxieties never {{amounted}} to suspicions. It was {{far better to}} believe in Mrs. Cliff and Ralph, and he would do it; {{and every time he}} thought of the two, he determined to believe in them. As to Edna, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> believing in her. He did so without consideration for or against belief.|$|R
50|$|After {{one year}} (on January 22, 1998), the Mannheimer Morgen {{reported}} of a: 'fantastic morale among the emploees at PFW.' There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> personnel cuts and, in the meantime, {{the number of}} employees had even been reinforced with temporary workers. There were 617 employees at the time and the planned turnover of 125 million DM had been achieved..|$|R
50|$|Where {{there is}} direct {{evidence}} or an admission, there will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> copying but without these giveaways, {{it can be}} very difficult to prove copying. If courts look at two works and find that there is substantial similarity between them and there is proof the alleged copier had access to the ‘original’ work, copying will be presumed. This presumption is rebuttable.|$|R
