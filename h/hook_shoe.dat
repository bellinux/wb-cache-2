The company patented {{such items as}} the sliding combination square, bench vises, and a <b>shoe</b> <b>hook</b> fastener. They make precision steel rules and tapes, calipers, micrometers, and dial indicators, among many other things.|$|R

He had first taken over the Long Branch and Sea Shore Railroad, when it was of no further interest to the Camden and Amboy, and improved it by extending it farther north on Sandy <b>Hook</b> to Horse <b>Shoe</b> Cove. From this base he then acquired the former R&DB. The Horse Shoe Cove dock was more sheltered than Port Monmouth, and its better access to Long Branch made it the preferred route for the combined railroads. Boat service to Port Monmouth was discontinued about 1871. Trains now ran through from Sandy Hook to Long Branch to Eatontown Junction and from there down the NJS main line to southern New Jersey. Some service continued to run on the old NJS route from Port Monmouth via Red Bank to Eatontown.|$|R
