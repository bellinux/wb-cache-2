5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure</b> panel construction, {{providing}} strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E

25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure</b> as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, it was divulged {{that highly}} ordered <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films {{from a variety}} of {{polymers}} could be fabricated by breath figures (water droplets) templating technique. In contrast to existing macroporous fabrication techniques, this technique is simple, more versatile and very cost effective. Amphiphilic block copolymers composed of a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic block were employed in this research to examine the process of porous film formation and the outcome of films generated using breath figure technique. A customized film casting system, established according to the casting parameters affecting the outcome of films was used to generate <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films for the studies. The casting method best suited to generate highly ordered <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films and the procedures to manipulate the size of the pores in films generated from amphiphilic block copolymers were also investigated and identified. Analyses into the formation process of the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films revealed that the airflow casting method where the cast of polymer solution was supplied with a flow of moist air was the most suitable method to generate highly ordered <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films from amphiphilic block copolymers. Variations to the casting conditions of the airflow casting method such as the rate of moist airflow could only provide limited alterations to the size of pores on films generated. However, changes to the chemical system of the casting solution such as the concentration and the molecular weight of polymers in the polymer solvent was more prominent in manipulating the size of pores in the generated films. On the other hand, any extreme variations to either the physical conditions or the chemical system could devastate the hexagonal arrangement of pores in these films. In the synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers in this research, RAFT polymerization technique was used to generate the hydrophobic polymer block followed by the subsequent chain extension polymerization of the hydrophilic polymer block. The polymerization 'process, especially the hydrophilic chain extension polymerization, was investigated in details. It was established that there were significant dependence on the composition of the initial polymer block used, particularly the molecular weight and the type of chain transfer (RAFT) end group in the hydrophobic polymer chain. Incompatible RAFT end group and high polymer molecular weights of the initial block usually lead to slower rate of subsequent chain extension coupled with increased terminations. These copolymers generated were usually bimodal in molecular weight distributions and broad in polydispersity indexes. <b>Honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films generated from one of these amphiphilic block copolymers were assessed as scaffoldings for cell culture to regenerate cells. In particular, the effects of cellular attachments and proliferations on the <b>honeycomb</b> porous <b>structures</b> were investigated. The assessment of these <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structured</b> porous films indicated that not only were these films not cytotoxic but they also enhanced the quantity of cellular proliferation (2. 7 x) when used as cell culture substrate compared to standard non-porous polystyrene cell culture surfaces. Finally, this research had shown a simple way to generate a new class of highly ordered porous material that could be customized individually {{for a wide range of}} applications.
