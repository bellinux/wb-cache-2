In virtue of the statistical characterizations of the SDCS, a new framework based on a statistical manifold is proposed to formulate the control design of the input and output SDCSs.

Therefore, prior to any conclusion, an economic decision should be made based on whether to compromise the potential for more power output by choosing the lowest cost of power or vice versa [12].

30|$|As {{discussed}} in [52], a simple price strategy may destabilize the power system operation. In contrast to conventional power system operation, {{in the near}} future, more distributed energy resources integrated into operation requires additional research on the convergence of dynamic pricing. In real-time operation, new market mechanisms are needed to create effective interactions that are {{closely linked to the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and DERs, to ensure the security and efficiency of the system, as well as the optimality of the DER operation. Regarding the convergence of the iterative-based method under the circumstance of transactive control, [29] and [38] discuss that, in general, the convergence can be obtained by following certain stepsize rules. In addition, as described in [38], the algorithms find near-optimal schedules, even when advanced metering infrastructures (AMI) messages (updated prices and residential load) are lost, which can happen in the presence of malfunctions, or noise in the communication network. However, much research is needed to increase the convergence speed, since high iteration numbers are seen in many studies, and these imply more time is needed for convergence.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} serial {{communication}} bus for a traction vehicle. The first part summarises requirements on a serial bus for a <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> inside a traction vehicle. According to requirements a suitable bus controller was chosen. The main effort is concentrated on the definition of a new communication protocol. The protocol is called the Vehicle Local Bus (VLB). It is based on a Controller Area Network. The serial bus supports all necessary data types for a real time control as short period data, short sporadic data, critical-deadline sporadic data, message data. The serial bus can be implemented {{on a wide range of}} microcontrollers or microprocessors because a programming interface is defined in the C language.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis conducted upon the sensor data {{gathered from the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of a central heating and cooling plant in Ottawa, Canada. After observing that the performance of four boilers and five chillers of this plant vary substantially in time under steady-state conditions, data-driven models were developed to explain this variability from the archived sensor data. By employing a forward stepwise regression and a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation approach, two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models with seven to fifteen hidden-nodes were selected for each boiler and chiller. The selected boiler models could explain 84 to 95 % of the variability in a boiler's efficiency, and the selected chiller models could explain 65 to 94 % of the variability in a chiller's coefficient of performance. Among studied nine variables, the most informative ones to predict a boiler's efficiency were identified as follows: flue gas O 2 concentration, pressure, part-load ratio, forced draft fan state, and return water flow rate. Unlike boilers, all four studied variables were found useful in predicting a chiller's coefficient of performance. These four variables were the return water flow rate, part-load ratio, outdoor temperature, and return water temperature.

In addition, potential use cases for the selected models were discussed with illustrative examples. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Smart grid ” {{generally}} {{refers to}} a class of technology bringing electricity delivery systems into the 21 st century, using computer-based remote control and automation. With the growing energy demand, efficient usage of the available energy resources is increasingly becoming a major issue around the world. Smart grid {{is a step in}} that direction. Research in the European Union and the United States are currently underway to modernize the existing and aging transmission grid and to streamline the usage of electricity. A typical electricity grid consists of two major entities- the utility company and the <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (DCS). Electricity is generated at the utility company and the DCS is responsible for the distribution of electricity to individual homes/consumers. A smart meter (SM) is an electronic device that measures the electricity consumed at the consumer’s premises and provides added information to the utility company. The data concentration unit (DCU) is a device acting as a communication hub collecting and encoding data from multiple smart meters in a neighborhood and forwarding the data to the utility company. The aim of this project is to design a network for securing the communication between the SM and the DCU in a smart metering network environment. The meter data communicated from the SM to the DCU is very sensitive and {{in the hands of an}} attacker, can reveal significant personal information about an individual. Hence it is of at most importance to protect the meter data transmitted from the SM. On the other hand the control signals transmitted from the DCU to the SM, need protection in order to thwart off unauthorized signals (i. e., an intruder can impersonate the DC and send out control signals to the SMs). Hence the SM and the DCU should be authenticated by each other and authorized and the data and/or control signals exchanged between them should be encrypted...|$|E
