5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> {{proportional}} to Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension {{with the same}} driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers {{to increase the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
30|$|<b>Efficiencies</b> <b>were</b> {{defined as}} the ratio of ideal to human {{contrast}} energy threshold. A separate <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> computed for each single-band and fused image block within each condition. All estimates were computed at the individual participant level.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> {{measured with}} the aid of a method based on the detection of the OI (5577 A) 'green' line. A sodium salicylate screen was used to monitor the intensity of the photons. Measurements at each of several individual wavelengths are conducted.

The absolute scale for the <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> determined in essentially the same way as in the Cameron band work reported by Lawrence (1972) ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> {{calculated}} at {{five different}} points of opening of gate valve at set injection rate.

5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} {{is limited by}} the river's flow rate, as seen in the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Efficiency</b> <b>is</b> {{essential}} to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make {{deep cuts in}} fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E
5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the tank-to-wheel (TTW) analysis of a series plug-in hybrid electric bus operated in Gothenburg, Sweden. The bus line and the powertrain model are described.

5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E
5|$|Water <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> being {{improved}} on {{a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{on changes in}} environmental efficiency using the ML index, environmental <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> shown to have consistently declined from 1992 to 1999; however, a rapid increase in environmental <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> seen after 2000, and an increase of 10.8 % was observed from 1992 to 2008. One reason for this increase in environmental <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> the substantial improvement in frontier technology; that is, the growth in environmental efficiency in the prefectures that constructed a production possibility frontier contributed to improving the environmental efficiency of Japan after 2000.|$|R

40|$|The {{measured}} and calculated results from determining the operating efficiencies of a laboratory {{version of a}} system for transporting electric power from one point to another via a wireless free space radiated microwave beam are reported. The system's overall end-to-end efficiency as well as intermediated conversion <b>efficiencies</b> <b>were</b> measured. The maximum achieved end-to-end dc-to-ac system <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> 54. 18 % with a probable error of + or - 0. 94 %.

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|An {{energy balance}} in inductively coupled radio {{frequency}} electrothermal thruster using {{water as a}} propellant was investigated {{with the objective of}} improving the thrust performance. Absorption <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> estimated by means of an I-V sensor, enthalpy transfer <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> estimated by means of a spectrometer and thrust <b>efficiency</b> <b>was</b> estimated by means of a thrust stand. The absorption <b>efficiency</b> using water <b>is</b> 0. 75, which is worse than that using argon. This is because the number density using water is less than that of argon due to the low ionization coefficient. The enthalpy transfer <b>efficiency</b> using water <b>is</b> 0. 14, which is superior to that using argon. This is because the temperature using water is lower than that of argon. The thrust <b>efficiency</b> using water <b>is</b> 0. 05. The left energy would be dispersed as frozen flow loss and nozzle loss. Overall, the thrust performance, thrust, specific impulse and thrust <b>efficiency</b> <b>are</b> 3. 6 mN, 340 sec, and 0. 05, respectively, at mass flow rate = 1. 1 mg/s, and Incident power = 100 W...|$|R

25|$|If these {{assumptions}} are correct, <b>efficiency</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{regardless of how}} property rights are allocated.
