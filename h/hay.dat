Two years later, as Valley West Mall and Southridge Mall were under construction, Merle <b>Hay</b> Mall completed a major westward expansion that doubled {{the size of}} the mall.

5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed <b>hay.</b> On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring <b>hay</b> to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of <b>hay,</b> and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>haying</b> has {{extended}} to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially threatening grassland birds. We evaluate the between and within-year effects of <b>haying</b> on grassland birds in Alentejo region, Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate variations on bird abundance and species richness {{in the fields}} <b>hayed,</b> with respect to past <b>haying</b> events occurred in a field and its surroundings and (2) to investigate the shifts in bird abundance, species richness and spatial dynamics resulting from <b>haying</b> a field and its surrounding area in a given year. We conducted grassland bird censuses during the breeding season through point counts from 2012 to 2015. The relationship between bird abundance/richness and past <b>haying</b> events was investigated using Generalized Linear Models whereas within-year effects of <b>haying</b> were analysed using Generalized Additive Models. Bird abundance in a field was positively related with the surface <b>hayed</b> {{in the vicinity of}} that field in the previous year. However, contrasting yearly effects were found for non passerines. Also, some species prefer fields with less <b>haying</b> events or surface <b>hayed,</b> whereas others occur mostly in fields frequently managed for <b>haying.</b> <b>Haying</b> a field leads, in the short term, to its abandonment by birds, and thus to a decrease in bird abundance and, for some species, to spatial concentration in surrounding fields offering suitable habitat. We conclude that within-year effects of <b>haying</b> have higher impact on grassland birds than between-year effects. Maintaining <b>haying</b> at low levels by rotating <b>haying</b> yearly through the different fields in each farm and using partial <b>haying</b> may be an adequate way to ensure an effective management of grassland bird populations.

5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of <b>hay</b> or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. <b>Hay</b> or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass <b>hay,</b> such as timothy <b>hay,</b> in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass <b>hay,</b> alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E

5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry <b>Hay</b> was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots.
