5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
500|$|Young {{primarily}} plays as a left-footed centre {{back and}} is also able to play at left back. While at Altrincham, he was also deployed as an auxiliary striker. While being a [...] "classy centre-half", he is an [...] "aggressive player who likes to win the ball" [...] and his play {{has been described as}} [...] "shackling". On his goalscoring record, Young said [...] "It's something <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> on in my own game during the last couple of years. I made a point of improving my scoring record and I've done that slightly" [...] in 2010.|$|E

60|$|I {{felt that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> in two {{quotations}} with striking effect. The others, {{with the exception}} of the Story Girl, looked suitably impressed.|$|R
500|$|I {{heard about}} [...] {{and it just}} really touched me, and she had stuff in her life that she could relate to. Gaga {{is one of the}} most talented artists <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> with in my life and I'm excited about doing more with her... There are a lot of levels to the song. There's {{something}} very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [...] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it happens to you...|$|E
500|$|The first scoring {{sessions}} were {{planned to take}} place in early 2009. During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for Avatar and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning till ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, [...] "Avatar has been the most difficult film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> on and the biggest job I have undertaken." [...] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate [...] "traditional" [...] score to drive the film.|$|E
500|$|... "I think it's {{her next}} sexy video. It's {{a very simple}} video for her – I don't think you've seen her this much under a {{magnifying}} glass. Everything's really strong and playful. We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, we talked {{a lot on the}} phone and met Tone and Rich — two of the best choreographers. [...] ' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was really impressed, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> almost with every female artist in the business".|$|E

500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> with the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is so, it will be my retirement. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." [...] He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.|$|E
500|$|Ouro Preto {{arrived at}} the palace at 4 p.m and {{suggested}} that Pedro II nominate senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins, who would arrive in the city two days later, as the new President. Deodoro avoided meeting personally with Pedro II, but once he heard that the Emperor had chosen a personal enemy of his for the office, he finally decided on the inauguration of the Republic. The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess. For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State {{to deal with the}} situation. But she was given the reply, [...] "Later on." [...] The princess, on her own initiative, called the council members. [...] The Council assembled at 11 p.m, and after two hours recommended that the Emperor appoint Antônio Saraiva instead of Silveira Martins. After accepting the office, this politician sent an emissary to negotiate with Deodoro. But Deodoro responded that {{it was too late to}} change his mind. Upon hearing the reply, Pedro II commented, [...] "If it is so, it will be my retirement. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Mexican {{newspapers}} in October 2016, {{she described the}} video as [...] " [...] very beautiful girls and guys who will dance around [...] and show the force of love in their lives, especially in [...]" [...] On the same occasion, she also expressed interest in working with Spanish singer and actress Belinda, and praised the Day of the Dead alongside saying that the music video is planned to emphasis her vocals, image and [...] "beauty of the city". The visual finally saw its premiere on YouTube on 1 February 2017. Inna thanked her crew in an interview, [...] "It is a joy and pleasure to film the video in Mexico, a place in this world where I feel the love and the kindness of the people. Also, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> with friends, people that I trust and appreciate, like Edward Aninaru, John Perez and Khaled Mokhtar. I thank them for their professionalism." [...] The clip reached over five million views on YouTube in one week, to which the singer replied, [...] "I didn't expect such a positive feedback {{in such a short}} time, thus I want to thank to my fans in the entire world. I hope that 'Gimme Gimme' will make them happy and give them energy every day." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
60|$|A strange {{sense of}} exultation began to creep into me. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> for that command {{ten years or}} more {{there would have been}} nothing of the kind. I was a little frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{the general}} said. [...] "I need now detain you no longer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>work</b> here for all night, {{and you had}} better go {{instantly}} to bed. Your brother is in a high state of fever." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{burst open}} {{the ends of}} my fingers at the very first, and during the reefing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with tears of pain running down my cheeks. And when all was done, I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion.|$|R
2500|$|In event finals, Ponor placed fourth on beam (15.066) {{and second}} on floor (15.200). On beam, {{she had the}} same score as American Aly Raisman, but after a tie-breaking procedure, Raisman was awarded the bronze medal. Ponor said, [...] "I will say it again, and I want {{everyone}} to know, I will quit without regrets. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> every second for my team, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> every second for myself, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> every second for everybody.

Hereward the devil. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> {{killed him}} with my axe; but she got it from me, and threw it in among the holy sisters, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>work</b> to get it again. Shame on her, to spoil my chance of heaven! For <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> surely won heaven, you know, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> killed the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You give me {{credit for}} greater powers of divination than I possess," [...] I {{answered}} calmly. [...] "Your father {{was always very}} kind to me, and I {{can assure you that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not forgotten it. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>work</b> to do now, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> scarcely an hour to spare. Mr. Moyat would understand it, I am sure." ...|$|R
5000|$|He wrote: [...] "It {{was also}} {{a chance to work}} on a big project with John Paul Jones, with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> many times before ... he is a great bass and {{keyboard}} player who had an important influence on my playing.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2012 interview, Albarn {{talked about}} the unlikelihood of any future {{releases}} from the Gorillaz. His relationship with artist Jamie Hewlett soured when Albarn chose to undercut the role of animation on their Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour. Albarn later rescinded this claim, stating [...] "When Jamie [...] and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> out our differences, I'm sure we'll make another record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing his research, in a 2007 interview, Bond said, [...] "the press reporter's {{access to}} a crime scene is restricted, it is {{literally}} blocked by the ubiquitous black and yellow tape emblazoned with the exhortation: CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS.

2500|$|... "I am a bit {{sorry to}} end it in this fashion. This is not exactly how I planned to place the period [...] It doesn't help that I feel that I have the desire and ability {{to be among the}} best in the world.

[...] - announcing his retirement.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>work</b> on {{hand that}} isn't as {{pleasant}} {{as it might}} be, it's a whim of mine to set about it without delay, and, besides, I'd rather take my chances at the Bridewell before nine of the clock than afterward." ...|$|R
