60|$|Looking at his body, my {{inclination}} was to pick my way {{among the}} goods {{that covered the}} floor and pull his ears for him. From his grave and massive face, he might, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> be the head clerk.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I greatly feared that I had made matters worse; for here was I, a guest in the house, {{actually}} offering to purchase clothing--ready-made or to to order--from my host, who, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> {{might be one}} of the aristocracy of the country. My fears, however, proved quite groundless.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. How can I tell? He {{may have}} found out from the amah <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b>|$|R
60|$|BARTHWICK. Went to bed? Who {{knows where}} you went--I 've lost <b>all</b> confidence. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you {{slept on the}} floor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! You are a {{guest of}} my house, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it is just such an {{opportunity}} as this that Girolamo is seeking.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{stepped on}} shore at Rotterdam, my first {{proceeding}} {{was to ask}} {{my way to the}} English Consulate. I had but a small sum of money with me; and, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, it might be well, before I did anything else, to take the necessary measures for replenishing my purse.|$|E
60|$|In his {{condition}} then words were impossible. His teeth rattled again, and he trembled like a hare caught alive. I kept my hold of him, and employed the time until {{he should be}} more composed peering into the darkness. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Chartersea might be within ear-shot. But I could see nothing but black trunks of trees.|$|E
6000|$|Rather did [...] "I waken to the voiceless dark," [...] {{and listen}} to the {{creaking}} of the bulkheads and the rippling of the sea alongside as the Snark logged steadily her six knots an hour. I went over my calculations again and again, striving to find some mistake, until my brain was in such fever that it discovered dozens of mistakes. Suppose, instead of being sixty miles off Futuna, that my navigation was all wrong and that I was only six miles off? In which case my course would be wrong, too, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the Snark might be running straight at Futuna. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the Snark might strike Futuna the next moment. I almost sprang from the bunk at that thought; and, though I restrained myself, I know that I lay for a moment, nervous and tense, waiting for the shock.|$|E
60|$|CROFTS. Oh, don't be alarmed: it's {{quite an}} {{innocent}} feeling. Thats what puzzles me about it. Why, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> might be her father.|$|R
5000|$|... "Congratulations on {{a really}} fine job. It reads good, looks good, feels good, smells good, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> tastes good as well."—Spider Robinson (Writer) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Got to be!" [...] exclaimed Sanderson emphatically. [...] "I'll fight 'em <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how!" [...] muttered Henry. His rest {{had done}} him much good.|$|R
60|$|Now, if the {{position}} is considered, {{it will be}} easily understood {{that this was a}} greater demand upon my confidence than was justified by my knowledge of Ayesha's character. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she might be in the very act of consigning me to a horrible doom. But in life we sometimes have to lay our faith upon strange altars, and so it was now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then also, how did I {{know that}} Juliana's merry childishness would not ripen into sweet, cheerful womanliness? Her father, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, {{might be the}} model of what a retired sea-captain should be; with {{possibly}} a snug little sum safely invested somewhere. And Juliana was his only child. What reason had I for rejecting this fair young creature's love for Josiah? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there I {{was while}} you were getting {{yourself}} alone, as you call it, wearing my poor little brains out to think of some story to tell people. I had to stuff them up you had a sprained knee at Chexington, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> any of them might have been seeing you that morning. Besides what has a boy like you to worry about? It's all nonsense, Poff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's been betting; he's {{sold his}} horse. He'd never have sold that horse unless he were pushed. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{he may be}} posted at Tattersalls!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{all want}} you to win," [...] came from Minnie Sanderson. [...] "I am going to root-- isn't that the right word?-- <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mean {{to shoot}} him," [...] Rolfe declared. [...] "But he may get shot, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{by some of}} these slaves he's made desperate." ...|$|R
60|$|I had no notion whether Therese {{could hear}} me. I seemed to {{remember}} that she slept in any bed that happened to be vacant. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{she might have been}} asleep in mine. As I had no matches on me I waited for a while in the dark. The house was perfectly still. Suddenly without the slightest preliminary sound light fell into the room and Therese stood in the open door with a candlestick in her hand.|$|E
60|$|My {{own face}} startled me, it looked so haggard and so wild. Could I present {{myself to a}} stranger, could I hope to produce the {{necessary}} impression in my favor, looking as I looked at that moment? <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, my whole future might depend upon the effect which I produced on Major Fitz-David at first sight. I rang the bell again, and {{sent a message to}} one of the chambermaids to follow me to my room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did my best, {{honestly}} did my best, {{to profit}} by the suggestions that were offered to me--not because I {{believed in the}} wisdom of my friends, but because I dreaded the effect of self-imposed solitude on my nature. Since the fatal day when I had opened the sealed packet, I was on my guard against the inherited evil lying dormant, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, in my father's son. Impelled by that horrid dread, I suffered my daily martyrdom with a courage that astonishes me when I think of it now.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> this Cuban stuff {{may have}} been sent from Morgan himself. Some {{of the people in}} Mariposa said yes, others said no. There was no certainty.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been like going to pick up a nugget of a {{thousand}} pounds, or two or three times as much, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> No trouble, no--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it ain’t pison?" [...] he ses. [...] "You’re {{a friend}} o’ Joe Clark’s, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he may ha’ paid you to pison it." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was still}} no man at the helm. The immobility of all things was perfect. If the air had turned black, the sea, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> might have turned solid. It was no good looking in any direction, {{watching}} for any sign, speculating upon the nearness of the moment. When the time came the blackness would overwhelm silently the bit of starlight falling upon the ship, {{and the end of}} all things would come without a sigh, stir, or murmur of any kind, and all our hearts would cease to beat like run-down clocks.|$|E
6000|$|I {{laid down}} the letter for a moment. If I had not already reproached myself for having misjudged Cristel--and if I had not, in that way, done her some little justice in my own better thoughts--I should never have {{recovered}} my self-respect after reading the deaf man's letter. The good girl! The dear good girl! Yes: that was how I thought of her, under the windows of my stepmother's boudoir--while Mrs. Roylake, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, might be looking down at me, and when Lady Lena, the noble and beautiful, was coming to dinner! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked down}} at his knee and {{scratched}} a patch of grease there. [...] "That's what! I was so blame mad I cut loose of the whole outfit. Once or twice sis had mentioned Nance in a casual kind of way, but as I didn't bite--she had quit fishin', and so I was all in the dark about her. She might 'ave been dead or married or crazy, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> However, now that I was on my way back with nineteen thousand dollars in the bank and a good show for more, I kind o' got to wonderin' what she was sufferin' at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it ain't pison?" [...] he ses. [...] "You're {{a friend}} o' Joe Clark's, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he may ha' paid you to pison it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{want you}} to help me if I did?" [...] Mrs. Sowler asked contemptuously. [...] "They may be both dead and buried, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> to the contrary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell that," [...] said Mr Donnithorne, {{shaking his}} head gravely. [...] "Some of them are {{undoubtedly}} of value; the others, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> may not be worth much." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the second}} place--assuming {{it to be}} always {{possible}} that we might see Lucilla at the rectory--the risk of abruptly presenting Oscar to her in his own proper person might, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, be a very serious one. It would relieve us, as I thought, of a grave responsibility, if we warned Grosse of our arrival, and so enabled him to be present, if he thought it necessary, {{in the interests of}} Lucilla's health. I put this view (as also my plan for returning by way of Dieppe) to Oscar. He briefly consented to everything--he ungraciously left it all to me.|$|E
60|$|Had {{the miller}} whom I remembered, died; and were these changes {{the work of}} his successor? I thought of asking the question, and tried the door: it was fastened. The windows were all dark {{excepting}} one, which I discovered in the upper storey, at the farther side of the new building. Here, there was a dim light burning. It was impossible to disturb a person, who, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, might be going to bed. I turned back to The Loke, proposing to extend my walk, by a mile or a little more, to a village that I remembered {{on the bank of the}} river.|$|E
60|$|To ask her plainly {{why it was}} {{necessary}} to keep the room in darkness while she remained in it, might prove (<b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary) to be an act of positive rudeness. To venture on any general expression of sympathy with her, knowing absolutely nothing of the circumstances, might place us both in an embarrassing position at the outset of our acquaintance. The one thing I could do was to beg that the present arrangement of the room might not be disturbed, and to leave her to decide as to whether she should admit me to her confidence or exclude me from it, at her own sole discretion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only by {{an effort}} that I can recall how life felt {{in the spring of}} 1914. Do you {{remember}} Heinrich and his attempt to make a table chart of the roses, so that we could sit outside the barn and read the names of all the roses in the barn court? Like the mountain charts they have on tables in Switzerland. What an inconceivable thing that is now! <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> shot Heinrich the other night. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{he is one of the}} lumps that we counted after the attack went back.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son is in London, ma'am, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> to the contrary. He was employed, when I {{last heard}} of him, in no very creditable way, at the Private Inquiry Office--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's his card, sir. He's {{a private}} detective, {{and may be}} busy just now, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> But {{if you can get}} Fogerty you've got the best man in all New York." ...|$|R
