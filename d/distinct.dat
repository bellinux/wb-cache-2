5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a <b>distinct</b> and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their <b>distinct</b> status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a <b>distinct</b> species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are <b>distinct.</b>|$|E

5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of <b>distinct</b> prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 <b>distinct</b> primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of <b>distinct</b> prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E

5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and <b>distinct</b> idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and <b>distinct</b> idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
