5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the <b>interstitium</b> and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the <b>interstitium.</b> Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
25|$|Increases {{blood flow}} through the vasa recta, which will wash the solutes (NaCl and urea) out of the {{medullary}} <b>interstitium.</b> The lower osmolarity of the medullary <b>interstitium</b> leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{permeability}} of {{the inner}} medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary <b>interstitium</b> as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology {{that deals}} with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the glomerulus, the tubules and <b>interstitium,</b> the vessels, {{or a combination of}} these compartments.|$|E
25|$|The cycling of and {{excretion}} of urea by {{the kidneys}} {{is a vital}} part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner medullary collecting ducts of the nephrons, thus raising the osmolarity in the medullary <b>interstitium</b> surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic AKI {{refers to}} disease {{processes}} which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can {{be due to}} {{one or more of the}} kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the <b>interstitium.</b> Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{metabolic}} waste products, such as immunoglobulins, protein fragments or intact proteins like beta-amyloid, may {{be cleared}} from the <b>interstitium</b> via a glymphatic system of lymph-like channels coursing along perivascular spaces and the astrocyte network of the brain. According to this model, hollow tubes between {{the blood vessels}} and astrocytes act like a spillway allowing drainage of cerebrospinal fluid carrying wastes out of the brain into systemic blood. Such mechanisms, which remain under preliminary research as of 2017, indicate potential ways in which sleep is a regulated maintenance period for brain immune functions and clearance of beta-amyloid, {{a risk factor for}} Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{pancreatitis}} (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis) {{is characterized by}} acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas parenchyma, focal enzymic necrosis of pancreatic fat and vessel necrosis (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in pancreatic <b>interstitium</b> and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{can also}} be found in the kidney. Although {{sulfatide}} is not necessary for the kidneys to maintain their function and structure, it does play an active role in different aspects of the kidney. For example, sulfatide is a ligand for L-selectin, which is a receptor that {{can be found in the}} kidneys. Specifically, L-selectin is a lymphoid receptor, and the binding between L-selectin and sulfatide in the kidney’s <b>interstitium</b> plays a major role in monocyte permeation and infiltration into the kidney. Additionally, sulfatide is also found in the glandular stomach epithelium and in the apical membranes of the distal kidney tubuli where Myelin and lymphocyte protein(MAL) is expressed. MAL forms complexes with sulfatide and other glycosphingolipids, and these complexes have been shown to play a role in apical sorting and stabilization of sphingoglycolipid enriched areas.|$|E
25|$|ANP acts on {{the kidney}} to {{increase}} sodium and water excretion {{in the following}} ways: 1) it dilates the glomerular afferent arterioles, constricts the efferent arterioles, and relaxes the mesangial cells. This increases pressure in the glomerular capillaries, increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in an increased amount of sodium and water being filtered and excreted. 2) It increases blood flow through the vasa recta, which washes the solutes NaCl and urea out of the medullary <b>interstitium</b> – the lower osmolarity here leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion. 3) It decreases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct. 4) It inhibits renin secretion, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. 5) It inhibits the renal sympathetic nervous system. ANP has the opposite effect of aldosterone on the kidney: aldosterone increases renal sodium retention and ANP increases renal sodium loss.|$|E
25|$|Pathologically, {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases such}} as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are all characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, cognitive decline, motor impairments, and sensory loss. Collectively these diseases fall within a broad category referred to as proteinopathies, due to the common assemblage of misfolded or aggregated intracellular or extracellular proteins. According to the prevailing amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, the aggregation of amyloid-beta (a peptide normally produced in and cleared from the healthy young brain) into extracellular plaques drives the neuronal loss and brain atrophy that {{is the hallmark of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Although {{the full extent of the}} glymphatic system's involvement in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear, researchers have demonstrated through experiments with genetically modified mice that the proper function of the glymphatic clearance system was necessary to remove soluble amyloid-beta from the brain <b>interstitium.</b> In mice that lack the AQP4 gene, amyloid-beta clearance is reduced by approximately 55 percent.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain <b>interstitium,</b> whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E
2500|$|Bradykinin plays a {{critical}} role in all forms of hereditary angioedema. This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the <b>interstitium.</b> This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting connective tissue, and edema develops easily. Bradykinin is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a pain mediator. [...] Dampening or inhibiting bradykinin has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{medullary}} <b>interstitium</b> is {{the functional}} {{space in the}} kidney beneath the individual filters (glomeruli), which are rich in blood vessels.

5000|$|Considerable {{differences}} aid in distinguishing the descending and ascending {{limbs of}} the loop of Henle. The descending limb is permeable to water and noticeably less permeable to salt, and thus only indirectly contributes to the concentration of the <b>interstitium.</b> As the filtrate descends deeper into the hypertonic <b>interstitium</b> of the renal medulla, water flows freely out of the descending limb by osmosis until the tonicity of the filtrate and <b>interstitium</b> equilibrate. The hypertonicity of the medulla (and therefore concentration of urine) is determined {{in part by the}} size {{of the loop}} of Henle.|$|E

50|$|Reabsorption is a {{two-step process}} {{beginning}} with the active or passive extraction of substances from the tubule fluid into the renal <b>interstitium</b> (the connective tissue that surrounds the nephrons), and then the transport of these substances from the <b>interstitium</b> into the bloodstream. These transport processes are driven by Starling forces, diffusion, and active transport.|$|E

5000|$|Edema, also spelled œdema, is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of fluid in the <b>interstitium,</b> located {{beneath the skin}} and in the cavities of the body, which can cause severe pain. Clinically, edema manifests as swelling. The amount of interstitial fluid {{is determined by the}} balance of fluid homeostasis; and the increased secretion of fluid into the <b>interstitium,</b> or the impaired removal of the fluid, can cause the condition. The word is from Greek [...] oídēma meaning [...] "swelling".|$|E
50|$|Also, the {{medullary}} <b>interstitium</b> {{is highly}} concentrated (because {{of the activity}} of the ascending limb), leading to a strong osmotic gradient from the descending limb to the medulla.|$|E
50|$|Pump: The Na+/K+/2Cl− {{transporter}} in the ascending limb of {{the loop}} of Henle helps to create a gradient by shifting Na+ into the medullary <b>interstitium.</b> The thick ascending limb {{of the loop}} of Henle is {{the only part of}} the nephron lacking in aquaporin—a common transporter protein for water channels. This makes the thick ascending limb impermeable to water. The action of the Na+/K+/2Cl− transporter therefore creates a hypoosmolar solution in the tubular fluid and a hyperosmolar fluid in the <b>interstitium,</b> since water cannot follow the solutes to produce osmotic equilibrium.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, oncotic {{pressures}} are {{higher in the}} peritubular capillaries, because protein composition in the <b>interstitium</b> is nominal; therefore, Na+ and water leave the interstitial space and enter the capillaries. When hydrostatic {{pressures are}} raised in the peritubular capillaries such as seen in hyperaldosteronism, Starling forces begin to favor [...] "backflow" [...] of Na+ and water from the <b>interstitium</b> into the tubules—thus, increasing Na+ excretion. This is the proposed mechanism of [...] "mineralocorticoid escape" [...] for how patients with increased levels of aldosterone are able to maintain Na+ balance and avoid an edematous state.|$|E
50|$|IPF is {{believed}} to be the result of an aberrant wound healing process including/involving abnormal and excessive deposition of collagen (fibrosis) in the pulmonary <b>interstitium</b> with minimal associated inflammation.|$|E

5000|$|IPF {{belongs to}} {{a large group of}} more than 200 lung {{diseases}} known as interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), characterized by the involvement of lung <b>interstitium.</b> The <b>interstitium,</b> the tissue between the air sacs in the lung, is the primary site of injury in ILDs. However, these disorders frequently affect not only the <b>interstitium,</b> but also the airspaces, peripheral airways, and vessels. Lung tissue from people with IPF shows a characteristic histopathologic pattern known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is therefore the pathologic counterpart of IPF. [...] The term 'idiopathic' is used because the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is still unknown. IPF usually occurs in adults of between 50 and 70 years of age, particularly those with a history of cigarette smoking, and affects more men than women. The diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of ILDs and the presence of a typical radiological pattern identified through high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In the right clinical setting, it is possible to make the diagnosis of IPF by HRCT alone, obviating the need for surgical lung biopsy.|$|E
