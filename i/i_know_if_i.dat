500|$|Parker was {{frequently}} compared to Derrick Rose in high school. According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, , Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: [...] "the back-to-back dunks against Washington {{in the city}} championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country." [...] Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as [...] "Grant Hill with a jump shot". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony. He hopes {{to be regarded as}} the best high school basketball player {{in the history of the}} city of Chicago and has stated that [...] "being compared to Derrick also drives me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get better than him or break the records he broke I could be one of the best players to come out of Chicago. I look forward to being one of those players." ...|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attaché wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves {{to believe that we}} are to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E

5000|$|Grove was on The Big Payoff {{for four}} years.

5000|$|In a 2009 interview, Antin {{described}} her path to becoming an artist: [...] "When I was a kid, <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> {{what kind of}} artist <b>I</b> was. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was an artist, <b>I</b> just didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was an actor, <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a writer, <b>I</b> didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a painter.

60|$|Well, {{after the}} first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left me, never to return. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to be}} hanged I could get up and make a good showing, and I intend to.

6000|$|... "Are there?" [...] Isobel exclaimed, with eager eyes.

60|$|The {{train is}} {{speeding}} along, and I am still chuckling to myself, when, without warning, {{a spray of}} water strikes me. The fireman is playing the hose on me from the engine.

60|$|And I {{told him}} {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself going around working off his worthless, old, green {{watermelons}} on trusting purchasers who had to rely on him.
