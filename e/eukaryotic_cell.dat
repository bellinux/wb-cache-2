5|$|Most <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> types {{usually have}} a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the {{maturation}} of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E
5|$|As {{the major}} {{defining}} characteristic of the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell,</b> the nucleus' evolutionary origin {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell,</b> the cytosol {{is within}} the cell {{membrane}} and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.|$|E
50|$|For other {{radiation}} types, the RBE is not {{a well-defined}} physical quantity, since it varies somewhat {{with the type of}} tissue and with the precise place of absorption within the cell. Thus, for example, the RBE for alpha radiation is 2-3 when measured on bacteria, 4-6 for simple <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> and 6-8 for higher <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b> The RBE of neutrons is 4-6 for bacteria, 8-12 for simple <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> and 12-16 for higher <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|The non-nucleic genome of <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> {{exists in}} cytoplasmic organelles, namely the chloroplasts (only in plant cells) and the {{mitochondria}} (in all <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells).</b>|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>cells,</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> are usually found in {{multicellular}} organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell; <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> have nuclear membranes.|$|R
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. <b>Eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
25|$|Several {{antibiotics}} cannot penetrate <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, these antibiotics cannot hurt intracellular {{bacteria that}} are already internalized. Using such antibiotics enables us to differentiate between bacteria that succeed in penetrating <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> {{and those that do}} not. Applying such an antibiotic to a culture of <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> infected with bacteria would kill the bacteria that remain outside the cells while sparing the ones that penetrated. The antibiotic of choice for this assay is the aminoglycoside gentamicin.|$|R
40|$|Measuring the DNA {{content of}} <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> is a {{fundamental}} task in biology and medicine. We have observed a linear relationship between the DNA content of <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> and the change in capacitance that is evoked by the passage of individual cells across a 1 -kHz electric field. This relationship is species-independent; consequently, we have developed a microfluidic technique—“capacitance cytometry”—that {{can be used to}} quantify the DNA content of single <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> and to analyze the cell-cycle kinetics of populations of cells. Comparisons with standard flow cytometry demonstrate the sensitivity of this new technique...|$|R
5000|$|Transfection is {{the process}} of {{deliberately}} introducing naked or purified nucleic acids into <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b> It may also refer to other methods and cell types, although other terms are often preferred: [...] "transformation" [...] is typically used to describe non-viral DNA transfer in bacteria and non-animal <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> including plant cells. In animal cells, transfection is the preferred term as transformation is also used to refer to progression to a cancerous state (carcinogenesis) in these cells. Transduction is often used to describe virus-mediated gene transfer into <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E

25|$|The <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> {{seems to}} have evolved from a {{symbiotic}} community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively, which were endosymbiosed by an ancestral archaean prokaryote.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{bacterial}} {{variants of}} phospholipase C are characterized {{into one of}} four groups of structurally related proteins. The toxic phospholipases C are capable of interacting with <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> membranes and hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, ultimately leading to cell lysis.|$|E
25|$|A {{karyotype}} is {{the number}} and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell.</b> The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species or in an individual organism and for a test that detects this complement or measures the number.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} actin’s function relates {{it to the}} maintenance of the cytoskeleton and, therefore, the organization and movement of organelles, as well as the determination of a cell’s shape.

25|$|Mitosis is {{the process}} by which a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> {{separates}} the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two nuclei. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that prokaryotic cells {{contained}} the building blocks required for multicellularity to arise, this transition did not occur for around 1500 million years after {{the origins of the}} first <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell.</b> Scientists have proposed two major theories for the reason that multicellularity arose so late after the appearance of life on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Eukaryotes: <b>Eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> {{are also}} {{surrounded}} by the plasma membrane, {{but on the other}} hand, they have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane or envelope. <b>Eukaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as (mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles). In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} utilize multiple {{approaches to}} mediate their toxicity to <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b> Dedicated protein machines deposit toxic effectors directly inside the host, whereas secreted toxins must enter cells independently of other bacterial components. Regardless {{of how they}} reach the cytosol, these toxic proteins must accurately identify their intracellular target before they can manipulate the host cell to benefit their associated bacteria. Within <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> individual targeting motifs and post-translational modifications spatially regulate host proteins.

25|$|Different {{metabolic}} pathways function {{based on}} the position within a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> and {{the significance of the}} pathway in the given compartment of the cell. For instance, the citric acid cycle, electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation all take place in the mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty acid biosynthesis all occur in the cytosol of a cell.|$|E
25|$|Somewhere {{around a}} billion years ago, a {{free-living}} cyanobacterium entered an early <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell,</b> either as food or as an internal parasite, but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in. The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} {{reactions}} generate a cellular energy source, ATP, {{in a manner}} similar to <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.|$|E
