5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. On July 5, 2013, Howard announced via his Twitter account {{that he intended to}} sign with the Houston Rockets after the July moratorium period ended. The NBA fined the Rockets $150,000 <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about Howard during this moratorium period. Dwight Howard officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, the Rockets were defeated in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4-2.|$|E

Reade changed her name by deed poll to Dogface, to become a house-mate during the show's first week. On Day 33 Big Brother told Reade that she had to remain silent until 2am as punishment for discussing nominations; she failed to keep quiet and therefore faced the public vote. Reade had a romantic relationship with Kris in the House. On Day 39 she and Siavash were punished by Big Brother <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about nominations, and told they were not allowed to swear before 3pm; they both failed and faced eviction. On Day 72, as a special prize, Dogface (Reade) legally changed her name back to Sophie. Since Day 88, Sophie was the bookies' favourite to win. She left the house to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E

The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881.

Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> too much.|$|E

The introduction of direct distance dialing (DDD) in the 1950s required the addition of automatic number identification equipment for centralized automatic message accounting.|$|E
25|$|St. James Theatre – 316 Queen Street. 1927 theatre {{building}} in the 1920s Hollywood/Spanish style designed for vaudeville but wired <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> pictures in 1929. The stage capacity, acoustics and seating sightlines meant this theatre was superior to the other venues of the period (His Majesty's, King's Theatre, and the Auckland Opera House); even after {{the appearance of the}} Civic it still stood out as the best venue for traditional live theatre.

25|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{academic language}} <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about {{the sociology of}} roles {{did not exist in}} the mid-19th century. Marx therefore borrowed from theatre and literature to express his idea. Although György Lukács pioneered a sociology of drama in 1909, a sociology of roles began only in the 1930s, and a specific sociology of theatre (e.g. by Jean Duvignaud) first emerged in the 1960s. Marx's concept is both that an identity appears differently from its true identity (it is masked or disguised), and that this difference has very real practical consequences (the mask is not simply a decoration, but performs a real function and has real effects, even independently of the mask bearer).|$|E

25|$|At the 1988 U.S. Open, Faldo ended 72 {{holes of}} {{regulation}} {{play in a}} tie for the lead with Curtis Strange. Faldo's even-par fourth round of 71 started with 14 consecutive pars.

After backing away from his bunker shot to scold some photographers <b>for</b> <b>talking,</b> Faldo made his lone bogey. Strange dropped a shot on the 17th to leave the two rivals tied for the lead on the 18th tee. Faldo missed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th green which would have made him the first British player since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to hold both major national championships. The following day, Strange won the 18-hole Monday playoff by four strokes. Strange shot an even-par round of 71, while Faldo struggled with a round of 75.|$|E
25|$|Ricarda Huch was {{not well}} known in the English-speaking world until the Australian critic and man of letters Clive James devoted pp.328–33 of his 2007 Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts to her. He called her the First Lady of German humanism and as a {{bridging}} figure between Germaine de Stael and Germaine Greer. He reminds readers that she was educated at the University of Zurich, from which {{she was one of the}} first women to graduate, because in her day, German universities did not allow women to be candidates for degrees. He describes her gift <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about the powerless as if they had the importance of the powerful, as shown in her book about the Thirty Years' War. According to James, when the Nazis came to power in 1933, they sought to recruit her into the party or at least “co-opt her prestige” but she declined to cooperate. She resigned as the first woman ever elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts and wrote to composer Max von Schillings, president of the Prussian Academy, asserting that the Nazi concept of Germanness (Deutschtum) was not her Germanness. She then retired to private life in Jena (she turned 69 in 1933), effectively going into internal exile.|$|E

25|$|Building on {{the wide}} {{understanding}} of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. Human nature is information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has {{to be understood as}} a statistical artifact <b>for</b> <b>talking</b> about a plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the long term memory of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and scientific language, Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.|$|E
