5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land.

5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

Suddenly in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> his harangue he broke off, as if stung by some painful thought; he rose uneasily, and I perceived him at length quit the hall, and through the long corridor seek the open air. He did not return; and soon Clara crept round to me, making the accustomed invitation. I consented to her request, and taking her little hand, followed Raymond. We found him just about to embark in his boat, and he readily agreed to receive us as companions. After <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> cooling land-breeze ruffled the river, and filled our little sail.

Our single boatman attended to the sail; Raymond steered; Clara sat at his feet, clasping his knees with her arms, and laying her head on them. Raymond began the conversation somewhat abruptly.|$|R
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays.

5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E

60|$|With {{a view to}} the {{approaching}} summer, our mariners {{turned their attention to}} <b>the</b> constructing <b>of</b> a tent within the crater.

50|$|The {{following}} is a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions that cause the Morning Glory cloud to form in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Carpentaria (after hypothesis of R.H.Clarke, as described in 1981). First, Cape York which is the peninsula that lies to <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gulf, is large enough that sea breezes develop on both sides. During <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> breeze from the Coral Sea coast blows in from {{the east and the}} breeze from the gulf blows in from the west. The two breezes meet in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, forcing the air to rise there and form a line <b>of</b> clouds over <b>the</b> spine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. When night comes, the air cools and descends {{and at the same time}} a surface inversion (where air temperature increases with height) forms over the gulf. The densities in this stable layer are different above and below the inversion. The air descending from the peninsula to the east goes underneath the inversion layer and this generates a series of waves or rolling cylinders which travel across the gulf. These cylinders of air roll along <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inversion layer, so that the air rises at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave and sinks at the rear. In the early morning, the air is saturated enough so that the rising air in the front produces a cloud, which forms <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder, and evaporates in the back, hence forming the Morning Glory cloud. The cloud lasts until the surface inversion disappears with <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Abraham {{had been sitting}} at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre.

Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, in {{the evening}} some of the buffalo hunter's {{supplies}} consisting of alcohol were shared {{with some of the}} soldiers for a small price. Some of the sergeants not staying in the supply camp apparently partook. Later next day 40 of the 60 men of A Company set out for Cedar Lake, the sergeants failed to check that every soldier had filled their canteens. In the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> those that had been drinking the evening before were terribly parched and did not ration their water. Their example led many recruits to drain their canteens. The buffalo hunters carried more water than the soldiers knowing that the heat and weather would impact finding water.

The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes {{for the chance to}} regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows {{what it is to be}} a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E
5000|$|Isaac Cline was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} rainfall distribution around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s. He found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant. Father Viñes of Cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band. [...] Normally, as a tropical cyclone intensifies, its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center. [...] Rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone's inner core, whether it be the eyewall or central dense overcast, within a degree latitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center, with lesser amounts farther away from <b>the</b> center. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force (34 knots/39 mph/63 km/h) winds. [...] Rainfall is more common near <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> tropical cyclones overnight. Over land, outer bands are more active during <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> which can act to restrict inflow into <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone. Recent studies have shown that half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature. [...] The chart to the right was developed by Riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about 140 mi, a fairly symmetric cyclone, and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear. Local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography. Wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table.|$|R

60|$|The {{fighting}} {{described in}} the last chapter, and <b>the</b> continual drain <b>of</b> disease, had again filled the field hospitals, {{and in order to}} preserve <b>the</b> mobility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force, it was decided to send all sick and wounded down to the base at once. The journey--over 100 miles by road--would take nearly a fortnight, and the jolting and heat made such an experience a painful and weary one to injured men. But <b>the</b> stern necessities <b>of</b> war render these things inevitable, and <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men to get nearer home soothes much <b>of</b> their suffering. <b>The</b> convoy <b>of</b> sick and wounded was to be escorted as far as the Panjkora River by the Royal West Kent, who were themselves in need of some recuperation. To campaign in India without tents is always a trial to a British regiment; and when it is moved to the front from some unhealthy station like Peshawar, Delhi, or Mian Mir, and the men are saturated with fever and weakened by the summer heats, the sick list becomes long and serious. Typhoid from drinking surface water, and the other various kinds of fever which follow exposure to <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> or <b>the</b> chills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, soon take a hundred men from the fighting strength, and <b>the</b> general <b>of</b> an Indian frontier force has to watch with equal care <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy and <b>the</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital returns. As soon, therefore, as Sir Bindon Blood saw that the Mamunds were desirous of peace, and that no further operations against them were probable, he sent one of his British regiments to their tents near the Panjkora.|$|R
