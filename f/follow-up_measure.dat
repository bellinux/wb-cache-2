5000|$|Crime {{displacement}} as {{crime prevention}} is contradictory, suggesting {{further development of}} the weighted displacement quotient (WDQ). Before the WDQ, investigating the phenomenon was difficult. Bowers (2003) writes that the [...] " ... WDQ not only measures what occurs in a buffer zone (displacement) but also relates changes in this area {{to those in the}} target area" [...] (p. 712). Using the WDQ can facilitate the work of researchers seeking to reduce crime in their community while minimizing the negative impact on surrounding areas. If a community is experiencing an increase in car thefts (especially on dimly-lit streets), as a situational crime-prevention strategy the county can invest in brighter street-light bulbs. As a <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure,</b> law-enforcement agencies can advise communities about possible sting operations in hotspot areas (making the crime riskier to commit, and dissuading potential thieves). Measures such as these will reduce theft in an area, potentially displacing the crime to a neighboring community. By measuring data with the WDQ system, law-enforcement agents can pinpoint the areas most affected and calculate the diffusion of benefits. Sharing data with other agencies will create an information network capable of preventing crime over a broader area.|$|E

It is also commonly transported by road and rail. It is one of the substances whose leakages occur very often. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the impacts of chlorine leakage on the lives and health of people and to provide an overview of urgent and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures</b> in case of chlorine leakage in the perspective of the integrated rescue system and the general public. In addition, to locate, describe and analyze past cases. The theoretical part contains information about chlorine, the principles of behaviour of the population in case of an accident with chlorine leakage and an overview of measures undertaken at the site of chlorine leakage. Through studying available literature and resources on the Internet, overview of major chlorine leakages in the Czech Republic as well as abroad has been created. Selected events are described in detail. The practical part simulates, using computer programme called TerEx, a chlorine leakage from a water treatment plant in Písek, South Bohemia. To compare the results, several model situations were created with varying amounts of chlorine leaked at different times of accident and atmospheric conditions.

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} a parent-delivered intervention {{aiming to}} address the social difficulties of children with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). The intervention was evaluated from three perspectives: effectiveness, feasibility, and appropriateness. Method: This one-group pretest–posttest study included 5 children with ADHD and their parents, who had previously participated in a therapist-delivered play-based intervention. The 7 -wk parent-delivered intervention involved home modules (including a DVD, manual, and play dates with a typically developing playmate) and three therapist-led clinic-based play sessions. The Test of Playfulness was used as a pre- and postintervention and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure.</b> Parents were interviewed 1 mo following the intervention, and data were analyzed for recurring themes. Results: Children’s social play outcomes improved significantly from pretest to 1 -mo follow-up (Z = 2. 02, p =. 04, d = 1. 0). Three themes emerged: the clinic play environment as a sanctuary, parental barriers to intervention delivery, and tools for repeating learned lessons.

We here present further tests of this long-term link {{in the form of}} follow-up studies conducted with two (separate) groups of infants who had earlier participated in speech segmentation tasks. Each study extends prior follow-up tests: Study 1 by using a novel <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure</b> that taps into online processing, Study 2 by assessing language performance relationships over a longer time span than previously tested. Results of Study 1 show that brain correlates of speech segmentation ability at 10 months are positively related to 16 -month-olds’ target fixations in a looking-while-listening task. Results of Study 2 show that infant speech segmentation ability no longer directly predicts language profiles at the age of five. However, a meta-analysis across our results and those of similar studies (Study 3) reveals that age at follow-up does not moderate effect size. Together, the results suggest that infants’ ability to recognize words in speech certainly benefits early vocabulary development; further observed relationships of later language skills to early word recognition may be consequent upon this vocabulary size effect...|$|E

The main focus of this program was the promotion of exercise as an alternative behaviour to smoking. Methods: The applicability of the intervention was assessed through questionnaires regarding: (a) attitudes towards smoking, (b) interest in information about smoking, and (c) knowledge about health consequences of smoking. Moreover, interviews were taken from the educators and the school principals. The questionnaires were completed from 210 students (101 boys and 109 girls) before the beginning, at the end of the program, and 12 months after the completion of the programme.

40|$|Maltz and McCleary have {{suggested}} a split-population exponential distribution to predict parolee recidivism where one {{portion of the}} population will never return and the remainder will return according to an exponential distribution. They have estimated parameters to fit the distribution to some sample data. A reanalysis of their data shows that the parameter estimates change systematically as more and more observation time is allowed in the computation. It is argued that this feature limits extrapolability. Local data concerning readmissions of discharged psychiatric inpatients are used to illustrate this point. In a recent article in this journal Maltz and McCleary (1977) discussed the &dquo;mathematics of behavioral change. &dquo; They stressed the important notion of defining recidivism (or indeed, any <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure)</b> in such a manner as to account for time dependency. Thus, numbers of recidivists are expressed as some function of time. Then, for any comparison between programs, an examination of the pair of recidivism functions may result in a more meaningful evaluation than comparison of merely two points on those functions. An important original contribution is an attempt to take account of the fact that not all those released from prison will return, i. e., the original population is split into two, one of which will never recidivate.

Guided by the attribution theory, {{the purpose of}} this sequential explanatory study was to examine weight bias among health majors at a southwest regional university to illuminate how attitudes can affect the level of care provided to overweight persons. The Attitudes toward Obese Persons (ATOP) scores from a convenience sample of 184 health majors revealed that participants 2 ̆ 7 scores were found to be significantly lower than the midpoint (60) of the ATOP scale, M = 56. 68, SD = 16. 75, t(183) = - 2. 69, p 3 ̆c. 01, indicating more negative attitudes toward obese persons. As a <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure,</b> 12 interviews were conducted to examine how health majors described their own experiences in working with obese persons. Thematic analysis revealed that the majority of participants expressed common stereotypes to describe obese persons as lazy, lacking self-discipline, and unhealthy. The integration of both sets of data supported the need to develop weight bias curriculum to facilitate social change whereby adaptive approaches to minimize weight bias among students within the classroom and clinical settings become best practice.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Previous {{literature}} {{has shown that}} multifaceted, interactive interventions {{may be the most}} effective way to train health and social care professionals. A Train-the-Trainer (TTT) model could incorporate all these components. We conducted a systematic review to determine the overall effectiveness and optimal delivery of TTT programs. METHODS: We searched 15 databases. Reference lists and online resources were also screened. Studies with an objective <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure</b> collected over 1 week after the intervention were included. The intervention had to be based on a TTT model for health and social care professionals. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. TTT interventions varied greatly, ranging from didactic presentations to group discussions and role-plays. The heterogeneity of the studies and limited data prevented meta-analysis. A narrative review found that the TTT programs in 13 studies helped to increase knowledge, improve clinical behavior, or produce better patient outcomes. One study showed no effect. Three studies showed possible effect and one study showed that a CD-ROM training method was more effective than a TTT training method in improving participants' knowledge. Ratings of the studies' methodologies suggested moderate risk of bias, which limits interpretation of the results. DISCUSSION: There is evidence that using a blended learning approach to deliver TTT programs [...] combining different techniques such as interactive, multifaceted methods and accompanying learning materials [...] can help to effectively disseminate and implement guidelines and curricula to health and social care professionals. However, further research is needed to determine the optimum "blend" of techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} {{impact of the}} "Reducing Use of Sedatives" (RedUSe) trial on antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prevalence and dosage. Methods: RedUSe was a six-month controlled trial conducted in 25 Tasmanian nursing homes in 2008 - 9 which led to significant reductions in benzodiazepine and antipsychotic use and a doubling of dose reductions of these agents. In a follow-up study, data on psychotropic use was collected from all nursing homes {{a year after the}} final RedUSe measure. Mean daily doses for each home were calculated by converting antipsychotic and benzodiazepine doses to chlorpromazine and diazepam equivalents, respectively. To determine the long-term impact of the project, 6 -month and initial baseline data were compared to the 18 -month follow-up data. Results: 1578 residents were audited for the <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure.</b> In the 18 months since the RedUSe project was instigated, benzodiazepine prevalence fell by 25 % in intervention nursing homes. Similarly, the mean daily diazepam equivalence in these homes had fallen by 24 %. In contrast, after a significant reduction during the RedUSe trial, antipsychotic prevalence returned to baseline levels in intervention nursing homes, with mean chlorpromazine equivalence remaining relatively constant with time. There was a delayed reduction in benzodiazepine and antipsychotic use in the control homes. Conclusions: Both benzodiazepine usage and mean daily diazepam equivalence continued to decline in intervention nursing homes in the year following the RedUSe trial.
