5|$|The Irregular at Magic High School {{was adapted}} into a manga series with storyboards by Fumino Hayashi and {{illustrations}} by Tsutomu Satō; it was serialized between GFantasys January 2012 and October 2013 issues. Square Enix collected the individual chapters into four tankōbon volumes and released them between September 2012 and December 2013. After {{the conclusion of}} the first manga adaptation, it was immediately followed up with two more adaptations beginning in GFantasys November 2013 issue; the two adaptations were based on the light novel's Nine Schools Competition Arc and Yokohama Disturbance Arc story arcs. The Nine Schools Competition Arc <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Tsuna Kitaumi and is currently ongoing. It was collected into four tankōbon volumes released between April 2014 and October 2015. Meanwhile, the Yokohama Disturbance Arc <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Gin Amau and ended in the October 2015 issue. It was collected into five tankōbon volumes released between April 2014 to November 2015. A manga adaptation subtitled and based on the Recollection Arc was serialized between Dengeki Daiohs April 2014 and September 2015 issue. It <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Waki Ikawa and was collected into three tankōbon volumes under the Dengeki Comics Next imprint. In the final chapter of the Yokohama Arc, Amau announced he will adapt the Visitor Arc, the next part of the story.|$|E
5|$|A manga {{adaptation}} <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Kanao Araki and was serialized in ASCII Media Works' magazine Dengeki Daioh {{between the}} November 2006 and August 2008 issues in Japan. Two tankōbon volumes were released under ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Comics imprint, {{the first on}} August 27, 2007 and the second on September 27, 2008. A four panel comic strip manga was published by Enterbrain in 12 comics anthologies released between March 26, 2007 and March 25, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E

5|$|The great {{significance}} {{of religion in}} the culture of Roman Switzerland <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the imposing size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, {{as well as by the}} great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists. As everywhere in the Empire, the Imperial cult was practiced in Switzerland; it had a particularly prominent temple in the center of the forum of Nyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{vanadium}} redox battery utilizes {{all four}} oxidation states; one electrode uses the +5/+4 couple {{and the other}} uses the +3/+2 couple. Conversion of these oxidation states <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the reduction of a strongly acidic solution of a vanadium(V) compound with zinc dust or amalgam. The initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion + is replaced by the blue color of 2+, followed by the green color of 3+ and then the violet color of 2+.|$|E
5|$|This kind {{of combat}} was {{consistent}} with the aim of minimising casualties and its efficacy <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the Battle of Strasbourg. The battle was primarily a struggle of attrition where steady pressure on the barbarians resulted in their eventual rout. Despite a long and hard-fought struggle, Roman casualties were negligible in comparison to the losses sustained by the defeated army.|$|E

5|$|A manga {{adaptation}} was serialized in Square Enix's Monthly GFantasy magazine. It <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Haruto Shiota {{and written}} by Makoto Uezu; {{based on the}} original Devil Survivor 2 story by Atlus. The manga made its debut in the January 2013 issue of GFantasy {{which was published in}} Japan on December 18, 2012. It ran for twenty-five chapters and ended in the November 2014 issue which was published on October 18, 2014. The chapters have been collected and released into four tankōbon volumes between March 27, 2013 and December 27, 2014.|$|E
5|$|His foundation, Grand Kids Foundation, {{has raised}} money {{to benefit the}} educations of inner-city {{children}} around the country. Granderson wrote a children's book, All You Can Be: Dream It, Draw It, Become It!, {{which was published in}} August 2009. The book <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> students of the New York City public school system. In February 2010, Granderson represented MLB at a White House function announcing Let's Move!, a childhood anti-obesity effort sponsored by First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama. Granderson donated $5 million to help UIC build a new baseball stadium in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|The Mana {{series is}} the result of Koichi Ishii's desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii's opinion, Mana is not a series of video games, but rather a world which <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> and can be {{explored}} through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii draws inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as movies and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii takes care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson's Moomin, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible for deciding if the precedent fact has been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E
50|$|The {{novels are}} {{published}} by Kadokawa Ruby Bunko (角川ルビー文庫), a publishing company {{which specializes in}} Boy's Love titles. The first 16 novels and 3 additional character books <b>were</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Nishi Keiko (西炯子), while all {{those that have been}} released since have <b>been</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Sey Goto (後藤星). The first and fourth stories in the series were made into a manga which <b>was</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Sey Goto.|$|R

50|$|Several of Yu Wo's {{works have}} been repackaged, i.e. the {{original}} story split {{into a different}} number of volumes with different cover illustrations. The 12 pocket volumes of ½ Prince <b>were</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Zhan Bu Lu and published from 2006 to 2007. The repackaged version of ½ Prince <b>was</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Xiao Qiang COCO (小強COCO) and first published in 2011. For Kill No More, the repackaged version was published from 2009 to 2010 and <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Xiao Tie(小铁). The repackaged version of Eclipse Hunter <b>was</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Blaze.|$|R
5|$|The {{fact that}} Demosthenes fought {{at the battle}} of Chaeronea as a hoplite {{indicates}} that he lacked any military skills. According to historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes's intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigour, stamina, military skill and strategic vision <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:* C.Carey, Aeschines, 12–14; K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396–398.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable {{at any given time}} because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E

50|$|The Emily Windsnap {{books are}} {{published}} by Orion Children's Books in the U.K., by Candlewick Press in the U.S. The first two <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Sarah Gibb, {{who continues to}} provide the cover art. The third to fifth books <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Natacha Ledwidge.|$|R
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
5|$|The town is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the High Weald, a ridge of hard sandstone that runs across southern England from Hampshire along the borders of Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent—the town's geology <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks (a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its exposed gulls), and the quarries at nearby Langton Green from which sandstone was taken to build houses in Tunbridge Wells. The town is sited {{at the head of a}} valley that runs south-east to Groombridge; like the River Teise, which originates in Tunbridge Wells, the stream in the valley is one of the many tributaries of the River Medway, which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald.|$|E
5|$|Three {{anhydrous}} neptunium oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as {{the full extent of}} the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E
50|$|The twelve Coloured Fairy Books <b>were</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> H. J. Ford (Henry Justice Ford), {{the first}} two volumes shared with G. P. Jacomb-Hood and Lancelot Speed respectively, the sequels alone. Several other volumes <b>were</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>by</b> Ford. A. Wallis Mills also contributed some illustrations.|$|R
