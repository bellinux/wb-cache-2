40|$|A novel {{class of}} {{isolated}} Capacitive <b>Idling</b> <b>switching</b> power converters featuring decoupled {{primary and secondary}} side feedback loops is presented. While preserving the cost, size and simplicity of the conventional multiple output dc-to-dc converters, this new class of isolated converters possesses the following advantages: no need to cross isolation barrier in the feedback, full regulation of all outputs from no-load to full-load, faster transient response, and independent short circuit protection of each output. Operation of the Capacitive Idling converters in single-phase ac-to-dc power conversion systems is also analyzed. It is found that these converters perform input current shaping automatically, i. e., without an input current feedback loop. This is achieved by operating primary side inductance(s) in discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM). Consequently, the high power factor performance is obtained without any penalty in complexity, cost {{and size of the}} converter. Input current shaping and full regulation of multiple outputs is made possible by the internal energy storage and presence of one secondary-side active switch for each output. When compared to conventional current shaper-regulator configurations involving up to three cascaded power stages, the new converter class represents a very attractive alternative. The main advantages of the Capacitive Idling shapers are: - current shaping and regulation in a single power stage, - simplified control implementation with no feedback isolation, - wide bandwidth loop gain on all outputs, - independent short-circuit protection of each output. Analysis of the Capacitive Idling converters reveals that the input current shaping mode of operation involves a trade-off between the high power factor and the increased switch voltage stress. Boundary of the DICM of operation is determined, resulting in a design equation for the primary side inductance(s). Experimental results verify the analysis and confirm that these converters represent a viable and attractive approach for input current shaping and multiple output regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Thermal engine {{encapsulation}} is {{an increasingly}} popular design choice, which insulates the engine from {{the external environment}} and retains heat in the engine after it is turned off. This decelerates motor cool-down and increases the probability for high initial temperature at a subsequent engine start, resulting in shorter warm-up and reduced friction between engine parts.  This work investigates thermal engine encapsulation (TEE) {{as a means to}} reduce engine friction and fuel consumption during engine warm-up. In order to predict the effects of TEE on the fuel consumption, it is necessary to model a wide range of thermal phenomena in different subsystems of the powertrain. The presented work proposes an integrated simulation methodology that enables efficient numerical simulations of heat transfer in the powertrain cooling systems and the engine structures not only during dynamic driving but also during the process of engine cool-down when the vehicle is parked. The integrated simulation includes a number sub-models that capture relevant phenomena in the vehicle powertrain and underhood. Presented in detail is the simulation procedure, which ultimately predicts the continuous development of the temperatures of the engine oil and the coolant as well as the temperatures of the different engine parts and components from the powertrain cooling system. An automated coupling between the one-dimensional (1 D) thermal representation of the engine and powertrain cooling systems with a three-dimensional (3 D) CFD model of buoyancy-driven flow in the engine bay computes the heat rejection during engine cool-down. By use of an integrated friction correction map the engine model computes the variation of friction losses at different engine temperatures. The integrated simulation model makes possible to predict the temperature of engine structures after a long period of engine inactivity preceded by dynamic driving, the exact temperature development of engine structures and cooling fluids after a recurring engine start, as well as the variations in the instantaneous fuel consumption.  Furthermore, a TEE concept for a passenger vehicle has been designed. The presented simulation method is applied to evaluate the effect of the proposed encapsulation on the development of engine temperatures during cool-down and their effect on the fuel consumption during a sequence of two Worldwide harmonized light vehicle test cycles (WLTC) separated with a period of inactivity. The results indicate a significant capability of encapsulations with high degree of coverage to retain engine heat for long time periods after key-off. The obtained results show that the encapsulated engine setup has potential for up to 3. 1 % savings of the fuel burned during a WLTC by a non-encapsulated engine in a cold environment. The amount of fuel saved depends primarily on the specific engine (mass, size and geometry), encapsulation design (geometry, thickness and degree of coverage), ambient temperature, and time of inactivity between <b>engine</b> <b>shut-down</b> and start-up. For periods of inactivity between 2 to 8 hours the potential for fuel saving is at least 2. 5 % of the total fuel burned during WLTC at ambient temperature of 5 °C for encapsulation with 97 % coverage...|$|R

40|$|Middleboxes are an {{indispensable}} {{part of the}} datacenter networks that provide high availability, scalability and performance to the online services. Using load balancer as an example, this thesis shows that the prevalent scale-out middlebox designs using commodity servers are plagued with three fundamental problems: (1) The server-based layer- 4 middleboxes are costly and inflate round-trip-time as much as 2 x by processing the packets in software. (2) The middlebox instances cause traffic detouring en route from sources to destinations, which inflates network bandwidth usage {{by as much as}} 3. 2 x and can cause transient congestion. (3) Additionally, existing cloud providers do not support layer- 7 middleboxes as a service, and third-party proxy-based layer- 7 middlebox design exhibits poor availability as TCP state stored locally on middlebox instances are lost upon instance failure. This thesis examines the root causes of the above problems and proposes new cloud-scale middlebox design principles that systemically address all three problems. ^ First, to address the performance problem, we make a key observation that existing commodity switches have resources available to implement key layer- 4 middlebox functionalities such as load balancer, and by processing packets in hardware, switches offer low latency and high capacity benefits, at no additional cost as the <b>switch</b> resources are <b>idle.</b> Motivated by this observation, we propose the design principle of using <b>idle</b> <b>switch</b> resources to accelerate middlebox functionailites. To demonstrate the principle, we developed the complete L 4 load balancer design that uses commodity switches for low cost and high performance, and carefully fuses a few software load balancer instances to provide for high availability. ^ Second, to address the high network overhead problem from traffic detouring through middlebox instances, we propose to exploit the principles of locality and flexibility in placing the middlebox instances and servers to handle the traffic closer to the sources and reduce the overall traffic and link utilization in the network. ^ Third, to provide high availability in a layer 7 middleboxes, we propose a novel middlebox design principle of decoupling the TCP state from middlebox instances and storing it in persistent key-value store so that any middlebox instance can seamlessly take over any TCP connection when middlebox instances fail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the above cloud-scale middlebox design principles using load balancers as an example. Specifically, we have prototyped the three design principles in three cloud-scale load balancers: Duet, Rubik, and Yoda, respectively. Our evaluation using a datacenter testbed and large scale simulations show that Duet lowers the costs by 12 x and latency overhead by 1000 x, Rubik further lowers the datacenter network traffic overhead by 3 x, and Yoda L 7 Load balancer-as-a-service is practical; decoupling TCP state from load balancer instances has a negligible (3 ̆c 1...|$|R
