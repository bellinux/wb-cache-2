25|$|After {{the end of}} the {{disastrous}} Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Imperial Russian Navy needed several years to absorb the lessons of that war, particularly from the Battle of Tsushima. Design work continued during this period, but designs for dreadnought battleships evolved constantly as new requirements were made. By late 1907, a consensus had been reached by the Russian Naval General Staff and an international design competition was ordered after domestic protests arose after the selection of a design by the British firm of Vickers. A Russian design was ultimately selected, albeit with extensive support from foreign companies, but money was tight and the ships took over five years to complete. All four ships survived World War I, but one was badly damaged in a fire while in reserve a few years later and was hulked. The three <b>intact</b> <b>ships</b> were modernized before World War II and they all participated in the war, primarily by providing naval gunfire support.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to evaluate the ability of simplified structural analysis methods, based on the Smith formulation to predict the ultimate strength of a damaged ship.

These, in turn, were obtained from a previous study in which a collision was simulated using a finite element model. Results obtained for the ultimate strength were compared against each other and with the results of the finite element analysis. Aside from some exceptions, the results of the approximate methods agreed well with each other for the intact and damaged conditions.

40|$|The {{matter of}} the paper refers to the dynamic {{stability}} of a vessel as an important factor affecting her safety at seaway. Ship’s seakeeping behaviour, which comprises the notion of her stability, {{is one of the}} researched key issues leading to the increase in understanding of the safety qualifying factors. Liquid sloshing phenomenon is a result of partly filled tank motions. As a tank moves, it supplies the energy to induce and sustain the fluid motion. The dynamic behaviour of a vessel at seaway is considerably affected by the dynamics of free liquid surfaces, therefore the influence of fluid movement taking place in partly filled tanks on the safety of ship’s exploitation process is emphasized. The paper presents the results of the experimental research and the numerical simulation of the sloshing phenomenon. The research was focused on the computation of the heeling moment affecting the stability of a vessel, especially dynamic effects, which are omitted in obligatory <b>intact</b> <b>ship’s</b> stability regulations nowadays. The experiment performed {{in the course of the}} research was carried out in Department of Ship Operation at Gdynia Maritime University. The unique test apparatus was designed and built.

40|$|For modern ship design — as {{confirmed}} by {{many examples of}} ship design and operation — the current intact stability code (IMO (2002)) {{does not provide a}} reliable basis for the assess-ment of ship safety in rough seas. In ship design the applica-tion of the IS-Code is not supporting design decisions towards increased safety in rough seas (Cramer and Krüger (2001)), and ship operators find their cargo and/or vessels endangered by large roll angles and accelerations (France et al. (2001)). Thus, there is a great need for procedures to analyze ship safety in rough seas. This paper presents innovative deterministic seakeeping test procedures which are used to identify the physical mechanism endangering <b>intact</b> <b>ships</b> by evaluating cause-reaction relations of wave/structure interaction. Rogue wave sequences are embedded in severe seas for computer controlled capsizing tests of different vessels at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. The model test results are used as a basis for the development of non-linear numerical methods to simulate ship motions in extreme seas with the target to design safer ships with reduced capsizing risk. Polar plots following from the non-linear simulations allow the evaluation of ship safety in severe seas with reference to course, speed and trim.
