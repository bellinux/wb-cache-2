The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl {{out of the water and}} onto the land for short periods of time.|$|E

25|$|The 1982 {{ruling in}} McLean v. Arkansas found that {{creation}} science fails {{to meet the}} <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view. The teaching of creation science in {{public schools in the}} United States effectively ended in 1987 following the United States Supreme Court decision in Edwards v. Aguillard. The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{and other}} {{scholars}} {{disagree on the}} question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist. Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell, et al. argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization. Feldman and Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.|$|E
25|$|The 9th, 11th and 13th chords {{are known}} as {{extended}} tertian chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are enharmonically equivalent to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, {{this does not mean}} that they must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).|$|E

25|$|The <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and {{zest for}} life. This breed {{is eager to}} please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make {{excellent}} family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes {{it one of the}} most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.|$|E

500|$|Evolutionary thought, the {{conception}} that species change over time, has roots in antiquity - in {{the ideas of}} the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese as well as in medieval Islamic science. With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century, two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking: [...] essentialism, the belief that every species has <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are unalterable, a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics, and that fit well with natural theology; and [...] the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science: as the Enlightenment progressed, evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history. Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature. In the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 – 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution.|$|E
500|$|This {{inclusion}} of the fantastic, however, is mostly a framework by which the author discusses human nature and society. One critic suggests that [...] "the story would be much the same without it". Balzac had used supernatural elements in the potboiler novels he published under noms de plume, but their presence in Peau de chagrin signaled {{a turning point in}} his approach to the use of symbolism. Whereas he had used fantastic objects and events in earlier works, they were mostly simple plot points or uncomplicated devices for suspense. With La Peau de chagrin, on the other hand, the talisman represents Valentin's soul; at the same time, his demise is symbolic of a greater social decline. Balzac's real foci in the 1831 novel are the power of human desire and the nature of society after the July Revolution. French writer and critic Félicien Marceau even suggests that the symbolism in the novel allows a purer analysis than the individual case studies of other Balzac novels; by removing the analysis to an abstract level, it becomes less complicated by variations of individual personality. As an everyman, Valentin displays the <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> of human nature, not a particular person's approach to the dilemma offered by the skin.|$|E
500|$|Plato {{was called}} by {{biologist}} Ernst Mayr [...] "the great antihero of evolutionism," [...] because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is {{also referred to as}} the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or [...] "species" [...] which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, [...] "...free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be." [...] The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since [...] "...without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, {{if it is to be}} perfect." [...] This [...] "principle of plenitude"—the idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation—greatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed unchangeable <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

500|$|In autumn 1706 Handel went to Italy. He {{stayed for}} long periods in Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, making {{frequent}} visits to the opera houses and concert halls. He obtained introductions to leading musicians, among them Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, and Agostino Steffani, and met numerous singers and performers. From these acquaintances Handel learned the <b>essential</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Italian music, in particular (according to Dean and Knapp) [...] "fluency {{in the treatment of}} Italian verse, accurate declamation and flexible harmonic rhythm in recitative, ... drawing the necessary distinction between vocal and instrumental material and, above all, the release of [...] wonderful melodic gift". Handel's first Italian opera, Rodrigo, showed an incomplete grasp of Italian style, with much of Keiser's Hamburg influence still evident; it was not a success when premiered in Florence, in late November or early December 1707. He followed this by a lengthy visit to Rome, where opera performances were then forbidden by papal decree, and honed his skills through the composition of cantatas and oratorios. In Rome, Handel met Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani, a diplomat and spare-time librettist; the result of this meeting was a collaboration which produced Handel's second Italian opera, Agrippina. After this work's triumphant premiere at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice, on 26 December 1709, Handel became, says biographer P. H. Lang, [...] "world famous and the idol of a spoiled and knowledgeable audience".|$|E
