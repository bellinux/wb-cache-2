50|$|Not yet eighteen, Rees-Mogg {{went up to}} Balliol College, Oxford as a Brackenbury Scholar to read {{history in}} January 1946 as a place had fallen {{temporarily}} vacant. By {{the end of the}} summer term he had been elected to the library committee (the junior committee) of the Oxford Union Society and was due to be an officer of the Oxford University Conservative Association under Miss Margaret Roberts, President for Michaelmas Term 1946. However, after two terms he was forced to give up his place to a <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-serviceman.</b> In 1946-8, beginning with an exceptionally bitter winter, he did his National Service in the Royal Air Force education department (his poor eyesight ruled out aircrew training) rising to the rank of sergeant. His duties included attempting to teach illiterate recruits to read and write, and his reference from his commanding officer stated that he was competent to perform simple tasks under supervision. He returned to Oxford to complete his degree, and became President of the Oxford Union in Trinity (summer) term 1951. He graduated that term with a second.|$|E

40|$|Upwards of 750, 000 British ex-servicemen {{returned}} home permanently disabled from the First World War. Dealing with {{the enormity of}} war time disability put great strain on medical and financial resources and forced the British government to reassess, and radically alter its responsibilities towards disability in Britain. The crisis of war highlighted existing inadequacies in care for the disabled. The war prompted not only changes in social policy, but in societal attitudes towards impairment as a whole. This thesis will assess provisions for <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> between the years 1899 and 1930. It will examine attitudes towards disability and argue that a social understanding of disability can be found earlier in British society than has been hitherto suggested. The state, charity and medicine recognized that disability {{was not just a}} medical condition, but a social issue. Far from being exclusionary and discriminatory, policies aimed at <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> were sensitive to the economic and social barriers which persons with impairment faced. These barriers included: discrimination; inaccessible public buildings and transport; poor employment options; unrealistic expectations placed on disabled persons to `overcome' their impairments; and poverty. Whilst not denying the very real hardships that some men faced, or indeed the failure of some policies, the thesis will posit that those who cared for <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen,</b> and <b>disabled</b> men themselves, held a more enlightened awareness towards disability than has been previously contended. Moreover, the state and charity discharged their responsibilities towards disabled men effectively. It is argued that disability issues during the years 1899 to 1930 are critically important for not only furthering an understanding of the war and its aftermath, but for the larger study of disability history. A closer understanding of impairment during these years prompts a reassessment of current disability theory. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the thirties}} bricks became more readily {{available}} and the pressure on land around London meant that working-class families needed flats rather than houses. Trobridge developed blocks of flats {{in the form of}} romantic cottages, castles and baronial halls, again mostly in Kingsbury. His work often included unusual forms and references to historical building types.Trobridge's working methods were unusual for the time: he employed <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> and insisted on paying full union rates to all his employees.|$|R
50|$|The Department {{also made}} loans {{of up to}} $500 (interest free, repayable within 5 years) to <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> who had been {{retrained}} (for the purchase of tools and other equipment), and {{to those who had}} not been retrained (to enable them to follow a training or educational course interrupted by the war, if their disability made such assistance necessary). This was administered by a special division of the Vocational Branch. These loans had been taken up by 1,630 men by March 1921.|$|R

50|$|Two key criticisms {{had arisen}} {{from the idea}} of a village for {{returning}} servicemen. The first was that ‘inevitably a time would come when there would be no disabled people to live in the village, which may then become derelict’. The other was that the <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> would not want to be segregated, nor wish to be placed in surroundings which would remind them daily of the Great War. This criticism in particular was taken up by the Ministry of Pensions, who had been unenthusiastic about Mawson’s idea from its beginning.|$|R

50|$|World Wide Pictures is a film, {{television}} and multimedia production company established in 1942. Its origins {{were in the}} British Documentary Movement founded by John Grierson in the 1930s, producing propaganda and information films for the Government during World War II. After the war, it specialised in sponsored films, advertisements, industrial and promotional films. Two notable early successes were The Undefeated (1950), made to promote state welfare services available to <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen,</b> and David (1951), commissioned to promote Wales at the Festival of Britain. The company is still in business, making advertisements, corporate videos and multimedia productions.|$|R
50|$|The best-known estate bothy {{is the one}} in the Royal Gardens at Windsor Castle, {{which could}} house about 25 people. It was used by the {{improver}} gardeners and <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> who worked on the estate. Most reasonably-sized estates had a bothy, which housed single men only; in fact, if they got married, they had to give up the accommodation in the bothy. The most famous person to live in a bothy of this type was Percy Thrower when he worked in the Royal gardens. Another example of an estate bothy is the one at Horwood House, which held just five men. There is also one at Attingham Park which is being restored along with the walled gardens.|$|R
50|$|Howson was the {{founding}} {{chairman of the}} Disabled Society in 1920, with Jack Cohen MP. After the first Poppy Appeal in 1921 used artificial poppies imported from France by Madame Anna Guérin, the British Legion commissioned the Disabled Society to make poppies in England for the 1922 appeal. Howson started with a workforce of five <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> at a former collar factory on the Old Kent Road in June 1922. The number of employees rapidly increased to over 40, and they made a million poppies within two months. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) visited the Poppy Factory in November 1924. The factory made 27 million poppies that year. Most of the employees were disabled, and by {{then there was a}} long waiting list for prospective employees.|$|R

5000|$|The name Thrower means {{someone who}} twists the fibre - {{properly}} wool - into thread or yarn. This term is peculiar to East Anglia, where Percy’s father {{worked as a}} gardener at Bawdsey Manor, Suffolk, before moving to Horwood House near Bletchley (now part of Milton Keynes) in Buckinghamshire as head gardener. Percy Thrower was determined {{from an early age}} to be a head gardener like his father, and worked under him at Horwood House for the first four years after leaving school. He then became a journeyman gardener in 1931, at the age of 18, at the Royal Gardens at Windsor Castle, on £1 a week. He lived in the bothy at Windsor, along with 20 other improver gardeners and <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> who were employed on full wages. The bothy housed only single men and if you [...] "had" [...] to get married you lost your job. He spent five years there under the head gardener, Charles Cook, who was subsequently to become his father-in-law.|$|R

50|$|Within {{three weeks}} of the Armistice, 11 November 1918, Ashton Hall hosted a crowded meeting to decide how Lancaster should commemorate those {{who served in the}} Great War. Its {{concluding}} resolutions were that a permanent memorial should be established in Lancaster to those who had fallen. The Westfield War memorial village grand opening was 27 November 1924, with the war memorial statue being unveiled two years later; 4 August 1926. It commemorated all those who gave their lives or limbs for their country in the Great War, in particular the men of Lancaster, who served in the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). Thomas Mawson, a renowned Landscape Architect born in Scorton, near Lancaster, derived the idea of memorial villages to commemorate the fallen in war from an article he read by William Hill, and expanded on this basic principle to include not just housing for the <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen</b> returning from the war, but also to give them employment in specially built workshops. This was a key addition, due to it being likely in a number of cases that the injuries sustained from war would hinder the ex-servicemen returning to their old occupations, and in some cases make it impossible.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was from}} a strong backing of public support, {{including}} financial help and assistance in erecting the Westfield village, that a Committee {{for the promotion of}} a memorial village upon the Westfield site was appointed at Lancaster Town Hall in 1918, using the ideas of Thomas Mawson. In 1919 the Westfield Committee obtained charity status for the project, and published a brochure advertising their intentions, appealing for funds and organising an inaugural ceremony. The brochure explained the benefits and aims of the Westfield scheme, which were to erect a memorial, build cottages for the married <b>disabled</b> <b>ex-servicemen,</b> found a hostel for the unmarried men, and provide workshops and social amenities. It also claimed the village would not just meet difficulties of ‘social reconstruction - the problem of the hour’ but also provide a model of town planning on a small scale for the imitation of other towns. The local connection of the village is reflected in the proposed allocation system - Disabled veterans of the Kings Own Royal Regiment would have first refusal, followed by those of Lancaster District, with all overtones of charity to be strictly avoided [...] Herbert Storey believed that this memorial village should stand as a tribute to the gallantry and devotion of the men of this regiment and of Lancaster men and women of other branches and services.|$|R
40|$|The Women's Institute Movement was set {{up under}} the auspices of the Agricultural Organisation Society in 1915 to improve the food supply during the Great War. The Women's Institutes {{encouraged}} food saving and preservation. This article draws attention to the rural retailing opportunities and markets that were established by the WI in wartime and continued to develop in the inter-war period, assisted by grants from the Carnegie Trust in the 1930 s. The WI established sales tables, depots and markets that enabled smallholders, cottage gardeners and allotment holders to find financially non-exploitative retail opportunities for their produce. Initially this produce came from their gardens, allotments and smallholdings, but in time preserves, baking craftwork, jam, cakes, toys, knitted toys and garments and even a wedding trousseau were ordered or sold through these various WI retail outlets. The markets were not restricted to WI members and often sold work produced by small­holders, the <b>disabled</b> and <b>ex-servicemen.</b> Furthermore they were seen as an example of co-operative marketing that could prove useful in preventing food waste and helping rural households to survive in wartime and later during the economic crisis of the 1930 s. This article suggests that these retail opportunities were of significance to rural women as a chance to earn much needed cash and in placing a value on domestic labour. They, like the WI, were a legacy of the First World War...|$|R
40|$|In 1917 the Coventry Evening Telegraph {{noted that}} the {{problems}} of ‘surplus garden produce’ had arisen and that ‘smallholders were being encouraged to group together {{in order to bring}} their supplies in quantity to market. Women’s Institutes have been formed, and these arrange for the opening of a market for a certain number of hours one day a week’. WIs, which had begun being formed {{under the auspices of the}} Agricultural Organisation Society from 1915 could be seen to be one of the earliest examples of Farmers Markets. These rural women were to improve the food supply in wartime when there was a food crisis; shortages, queues, price rises and in 1918 the introduction of rationing. The WIs encouraged food saving and preservation their markets enabled small holders, cottage gardeners and allotment holders to find a financial non- exploitive outlet for their produce. Markets and retail outlets developed in a number of towns or even cities in rural areas: Worcester, Leamington Spa and Lichfield and in post-war Britain depot trading centres were set up in some county towns Maidstone in Kent in 1919, Winchester in 1920. Between them they provided rural women with a retail space initially for their garden produce and then in time for the preserves, baking and craftwork. Jam, cakes, toys, knitted toys and garments even a wedding trousseau were ordered or sold through these retail outlets. The Markets were not restricted to WI members and often sold work produced by small­holders, the <b>disabled</b> and <b>ex-servicemen.</b> Membership required buying at least one share; as they were a co-operative venture there was a limit on the number of shares it was possible to purchase. Sales tables at some monthly WI meeting provided yet another retail outlet for rural women. This paper will explore the significance of these retail opportunities to rural women: as a chance to earn much needed cash, in placing a value on domestic labour and as an indication that when looking at rural women’s lives, in first half of the twentieth century, divisions between being consumers and producers of food and domestic products may be more fluid than it is something assumed...|$|R
