40|$|Up to date <b>Danube</b> <b>space</b> is {{the most}} {{developed}} region in its category. The biggest cities in Serbia belong to the Danube axis, the biggest economic potentials and development possibilities. At the same time border regions along the Danube become potentially regions with the biggest chance for spatial integration with the neighboring countries. This way, they are opening the possibility of state territory promotion. Such a trend is the consequence of the Danube natural position and its important for the Balkan Space and Europe in general, {{as well as the}} historical facts talking about the unbreakable relation of the nations along the Danube (from ancient Greeks up to date) who were searching, through history, over him the reasons for cooperation and mutual development. That is why this paper is trying to give a short chronological overview upon the use of the Danube potentials and look back on the present state and perspectives in the Serbian <b>Danube</b> <b>Space...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{underline}} the importance of the issues, which are object of intervention within Priority 11 of the EUSDR, namely working together to tackle security and organized crime. The author has presented a large scale study on the security issues in European context, reflected in his PhD dissertation. Exploration of the existing EU programming documents and strategic plans for cooperation in the area of security. Through examining the progress of activities and results within the Priority area 11 of the EUSDR, the author outlines the contribution of all Danube countries for the cooperation in security within the Danube region. The paper can attract the attention of academics, stakeholders and NGOs on initiating of projects within the Priority area 11 of EUSDR. The added value of the paper is in finding the interconnection between guaranteeing the security in all its types within the <b>Danube</b> <b>space</b> and the prosperity of the region...|$|E
40|$|The Danube Region, {{perhaps the}} most {{complicated}} formation of the European continent, is based on physical geographical factors (the Danube, the river’s catchment area). The catchment area as a physical geographical framework forms a kind of water use and pollution unit, a focus, and through man-made transformation, it partially represents a kind of risk community as well. For {{people living in the}} area alongside the river itself, the proximity of the Danube represents a certain historical and cultural attitude. With the exception of the close riverbank area, the region’s population has only indirect <b>Danube</b> <b>space</b> consciousness. The region’s relief divides the Danube catchment area into several sub-catchment areas and natural units. The set of basins (Upper, Middle and Lower Danube Basin) potentially carries options for partial integration. Within some basins the intensification of co-operation may resolve the historically developed tensions, still partly existing today. This report is based on a synthesis of a number of sources listed in the bibliography, as well as original research by Institute staff. Its aim is not to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Danube transnational region as such, but well structured information useful enough {{to take into account the}} territorial specificities of this region when developing scenarios at the European level. To this end, it presents the most relevant sectoral trends affecting the Danube Region at the present time, as well as domestic and EU policy challenges and development opportunities. On the basis of analysis, development scenarios are outlined, also identifying the key trends which will influence integration and Europeanisation in the forthcoming decades...|$|E

40|$|The paper covers {{presentation}} {{of ways of}} international cooperation of Danube region on the territory of Republic of Serbia and its spatial integration levels of the immediate and wider environment (cross-border or trans-border aspect of cooperation, transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation). <b>Danube</b> region is <b>space</b> with the most active current integration processes, which take place under the initiative of the European Union and the definition of European instruments supporting cooperation of states along the Danube River flow, {{as well as more}} specific territorial entities that are directly related to the river. In addition to European strategies and programs, the cooperation includes cross-border cooperation activities of Serbia based on resolving socio-economic problems, issues related to infrastructure, environmental protection and other areas of cooperation that include spaces Euroregional Association. The grounds for the implementation of planned measures for further Danube region development also include functional connections on regional and local level within the territory of the Republic of Serbia...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{present a}} study of {{cultural}} heritage of rural landscape in Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve focuses on cultural landscapes that reflect traditional lifestyle of the locals, activities of deltas’ resource sustainable exploitation, creating visual elements in the rural landscape, especially on traditional buildings, fishermens’ temporary shelters from fishing areas and other traditional activities. In order to highlight the necessity of cultural heritage harmonization and architectural conservation with the socio-economic requirements of rural habitat in Danube Delta were made some field activities through different methods of field investigation, like structured and semistructured interviews, questionnaires, focus groups. In Danube Delta villages, the changes imposed by the touristic function of most of existing or new construction have produced important changes in the architectural landscape of existing settlements impending danger of destroying traditional architectural values which demonstrates {{on the one hand}} the personality and inovation spirit of local people in their constructions, particularly in the use of local materials, {{and on the other hand}} gives a specific area feature that blends perfectly with the natural landscape. <b>Danube</b> Delta, the <b>space</b> of complex features in terms of cultural values, characterized as open gate of cultural interference, is the area that can provide options to balance cohabitation and cultural heritage...|$|R
40|$|Between 2006 and 2008, the National Research and Development Institute for Urban and Regional Planning URBANPROIECT Bucharest participated - {{within the}} {{framework}} of EU programme INTERREG IIIB - at the DONAUREGIONEN Project: The Spatial Development Concept of Interregional Cooperation in the <b>Danube</b> <b>Space.</b> The aim of the project was to create a complex assemblage of knowledge about the potential possibilities of development in the Danube regions and the related interregional relations, to initiate common steps when choosing the regional development centres and to encourage cross-border cooperation. This action should help to overcome the existing information barriers and also the local authorities in the stage of planning the regional and city development. The project was structured by a summary evaluation of the development potential on the Danube area – analyses of problems, interests, and conflicts. The elaboration of the summary documents was based on the general answers to the four thematic fields representing the basic functional complex: 1. Natural resources, environmental protection, and creation; 2. Human resources, urban structure, and quality of life; 3. Transport and technical infrastructure; 4. Economic structure. On the basis of this summary evaluation, a concept of development and arrangement of the territory of the Danube area and a typology of regions will be developed and, finally, proposals and recommendations will be elaborated for regional and local authorities dealing with the regional and city development planning. The result of the project will be mainly to outline: - the conditions for the optimization of technical, territorial, socio-economic, and environmental relations in the Danube river corridor; - the existence of mutually linked and balanced urban and economic development centres, which will have positive influence on the development of their regions, and - the conditions for the constitution of a development corridor that will act as a stabilization agent balancing the regional disparities in the different member countries. The Geographical information system supporting the elaboration of the Donauregionen project system was conceived as a working GIS storing all the geographical data necessary for the processing of project outputs. All the geographical data were distributed in the WGS- 84 system of coordinates. The project area of interest includes a territory within 5 countries of the Danube region (Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania) ...|$|E
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the space the myth of the water is the specific one, which, trough its fluidity comes close to the myth of the air and also, through the dynamic force draws close to the myth of the fire, opposed to the earth which is the sign of stability. Studying the myth, we will approach to the image of Danube in the literary texts of Vasile Voiculescu and of George Meniuc. Both authors are tempted to absorb the own experiences through the phantasmagorical images, where the reality blends skillfully with the imagination, water having the function to cross the being into another world which is so little known. For V. Voiculescu, the water can be placed neither in the past, nor in the future, it lives in the circle time. It holds the secret of destiny. Even if it seems predictable, it contains the mysteries that can not be definitively perceived. For V. Voiculesc the river lends the poem which links the man to the aquatic life. Thus the fisherman, Amin, is convinced that he comes from the sturgeon, just like the old Santiago, the character from the novel of Ernest Hemingway, who is united with the porpoises and the flying fish. G. Meniuc is the artist who kept artistically silent in the fiftyřs in MSSR, being suspected during his life of the beginning of his literary career in the interwar period. That is why, <b>Danube</b> represents the <b>space</b> of the knowledge, of a freedom that combines the contemplation, the decoding and the memory. By the Danube (Reni and Tulcea) G. Meniuc reveals the Romanian ethnic space...|$|R
