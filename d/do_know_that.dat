5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists {{do not know what}} happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{established}} Buffyverse canon {{is unclear}} about the happenings of Buffy pre-Sunnydale. The film, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' starring Kristy Swanson {{is not considered}} 'canon'. However we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Buffy burnt down the gym at Hemery High School. We also know that her Watcher Merrick, was killed. It is generally assumed that Pike was {{also part of the}} canon because of his presence in the Buffy comic, The Origin.|$|E
25|$|Fitzy Fitzgerald (Cavan Cunningham) is {{the mayor}} of Dog River. He tends to take his {{position}} very seriously. He is quite paranoid about losing his job and thinks that anyone will do anything for the position of mayor, although no one really wants it. Not a lot is revealed about his personal life; however, we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he {{has at least one}} child, and several episodes imply that he may have a son.|$|E

25|$|We <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Seleucus {{managed to}} defeat Antigonus {{in at least}} one decisive battle. This battle is only {{mentioned}} in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.|$|E
25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We never learn {{anything}} about her husband, but we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them {{by the events of}} Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of custom plate options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. Custom or personalised plates come with the {{optional}} purchase of a contract. This contract allows the plate holder to retain the plates whether on a vehicle or not. Holding a contract on certain plates, means that when the plates are no longer registered they cannot be resold/issued to another person unless the contract holder sells the contract. VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure {{of the total number of}} custom registration plates sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads. However, VicRoads <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> around 30,000 sets of custom registration plates are made every year, and they estimate 10 percent of registered vehicles have custom registration plates.|$|E

500|$|The film begun {{production}} in May 2006, and {{was delivered to}} Nickelodeon roughly a year later, allowing time for the network's marketers to promote it. A SpongeBob marathon is {{a key part of}} the channel's effort to stave off increasing competition from Disney Channel, Cartoon Network and other rivals. Cyma Zarghami, the president of the Nickelodeon networks, said [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> kids like events as much as adults do [...] There's a certain amount of water-cooler talk that goes on among kids." ...|$|E

Amnesty's Piers Bannister informed press that [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there's {{a high level}} of homophobia in Jamaica, so there was a possibility that it was a hate crime. Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We're not saying it wasn't a robbery; we just want a full investigation." [...] Schleifer publicly stated that it is [...] "really important to investigate [...] thoroughly. Because there are really strong indications that {{it might have been a}} homophobic attack".|$|E
500|$|Reporting for Slate, {{journalist}} Michael Agger {{observed that}} an edit by a Scientology-associated IP address to a Scientology-related article on Wikipedia {{does not necessarily}} indicate such an edit was made by {{an employee of the}} organization. Virgil Griffith explained, [...] "Technically, we don't know if it came from an agent of that company. However, we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> edit came from someone with access to their network. If the edit occurred during working hours, then we can reasonably assume that the person is either an employee of that company or a guest that was allowed access to their network." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1942, J.

I <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> whether it shall live or die is now in the balance." [...] Regarding the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its [...] "free institutions", {{separation}} of powers, and the Bill of Rights.

500|$|Peter Thompson, {{the head}} of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, {{described}} the situation {{on the night of the}} coup as [...] "a very large presence of the military in the streets.

I <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official." [...] There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ialá Embaló.|$|E
500|$|By the 1830s, the Sherwoods {{had become}} more prosperous and the family decided {{to travel to the}} continent. The texts that Sherwood wrote {{following}} this trip reflect her exposure to French culture in particular. She also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project at this time, for which she learned Hebrew. To assist her, her husband assembled, over the course of ten years, a large Hebrew-English concordance. Unfortunately, Sherwood's autobiography provides scant details regarding the last forty-odd years of her life. [...] However, we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> even in her seventies, Sherwood wrote for four or five hours a day; many of these books were co-authored with Sherwood's daughter, Sophia. [...] According to M. Nancy Cutt, a Sherwood scholar, this joint authorship led to a [...] "watery sentimentality" [...] not evident in Sherwood's earlier works as well as a greater emphasis on issues of class.|$|E

500|$|Geologists <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> deep {{channels}} {{were carved}} {{on the top}} of the Muav Limestone during this time. Streams were the likely cause, but marine scour may be to blame. Either way, these depressions were filled with freshwater limestone about 385million years ago in the Middle Devonian in a formation that geologists call the Temple Butte Limestone (see 4a in figure 1). Marble Canyon in the eastern part of the park displays these filled purplish-colored channels well. Temple Butte Limestone is a cliff-former in the western part of the park where it is gray to cream-colored dolomite. Fossils of animals with backbones are found in this formation; bony plates from freshwater fish in the eastern part and numerous marine fish fossils in the western part. Temple Butte is [...] thick; thinner near Grand Canyon Village and thicker in western Grand Canyon. An unconformity representing 40 to 50million years of lost geologic history marks the top of this formation.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} premiered via Robyn's {{official}} Myspace account on 28 October 2010. The video received positive reviews from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News called it [...] "a clothing-optional video that's raising eyebrows (and temperatures) worldwide. Though [...] there's nothing {{really all that}} shocking about the clip ... except maybe for its honesty." [...] Megan Vick of Billboard was positive on the video, saying that, [...] "We can't be entirely sure what Robyn {{was trying to say}} with this treatment, but we <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this video is hot – and intriguing." [...] Robbie Daw of music website Idolator compared it to a scene from The X-Files. He concluded by saying that [...] "This is hardcore, indeed." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy said that Robyn looks [...] "cherubic and futuristic , as if she belongs on the set of “Caprica”." [...] Katz compared Robyn's outfit to Rebecca Horn's [...] "Overflowing Blood Machine". DJ Ron Slomowicz of About.com called the video [...] "creepy and confusing" [...] and said, [...] "Overall, it is a scintillating if not entirely clear video." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we felt like we had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E

[...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy.
