60|$|The sun was <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> when we rode off. The {{pleasant}} and dusty stretches alternated. About one o'clock we halted {{on the edge}} of a deep wooded ravine to take our usual noonday rest. I scouted along the edge in the hope of seeing game of some kind. Presently I heard the cluck-cluck of turkeys. Slipping along to an open place I peered down to be thrilled by sight of four good-sized turkeys. They were walking along the open strip of dry stream-bed at the bottom of the ravine. One was chasing grasshoppers. They were fairly close. I took aim at one, and thought I could have hit him, but suddenly I remembered Romer and R.C. So I slipped back and called them.|$|E

Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the poor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool stream, and the One-eyed Hans washed a part of the soot from his hands and face. On and on they rode; never once did the Baron Conrad move his head or alter that steadfast look as, gazing {{straight}} before him, he rode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road, with poor little Otto's yellow head and white face resting against his steel-clad shoulder--and St. Michaelsburg still eight leagues away.|$|R

50|$|With a {{total of}} 1,305-1,752 kW (1,750-2,350 hp) the SM.81 was well served, even if {{individually}} the engines were underpowered. The maximum speed with the AR.125 engine was 340 km/h, with others it was from 320 - 347 km/h. Cruise speed at its best was 260 km/h, but there were reported values of up to 330 km/h. The extra power of many engine-sets was valuable in <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> conditions, but their larger diameter was sometimes enough to reduce maximum speed by adding more drag. Even so, the aircraft was faster than the Junkers Ju 52, its most direct equivalent.|$|E
50|$|The {{nation of}} Rhodesia {{emerged as a}} {{prolific}} user of both the Alouette II and its enlarged sibling, the Alouette III. Early operations were flown {{with an emphasis on}} its use by the Army and British South Africa Police, including paramilitary and aerial reconnaissance operations. Throughout the 1960s, the type progressively spread into additional roles, including aerial supply, casualty evacuation, communications relays, and troop-transports. Rhodesian aerial operations would typically involve flying under relatively <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> conditions, which reduced the efficiency of aircraft in general; however, the Alouette II proved to be both hardy and relatively resistant to battle damage. In order to extend the inadequate range of the type, fuel caches were strategically deployed across the country to be used for refuelling purposes.|$|E

It features the composite-based advanced Chinook rotor blade (derived from the cancelled RAH-66 Comanche) 20% more powerful Honeywell T55-715 engines, and the active parallel actuator system (APAS); the APAS enhances the digital advanced flight-control system, providing an exact torque split between the rotors for greater efficiency. A new fuel system combines the three fuel cells in each sponson into one larger fuel cell and eliminating intracell fuel transfer hardware, reducing weight by 90 kg and increasing fuel capacity. Electrical capacity is increased by three 60 kVA generators.|$|E

Before Bunyan had been behind the wall, he was scared by the father of lies, who suggested to him--'You are very hot for mercy, but I will cool you, though I be seven years in chilling your heart.'

30|$|The {{number of}} fields {{cultivated}} in the wetland depressions {{depends on the}} balance between too much and too little water.

6000|$|INTER. You say the truth: [...] "For {{the things}} which are seen are temporal; but the {{things which are}} not seen are eternal" [...] (2 Cor. 4:18). But though this be so, yet since things present, and our fleshly appetite, are such near {{neighbours}} one to another; and again, because things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers one to another; therefore {{it is that the}} first of these so suddenly fall into amity, and that distance is so continued between the second. Then I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by the hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall, and one standing by it, always casting much water upon it, to quench it; yet did the fire burn <b>higher</b> <b>and</b> <b>hotter.</b>|$|R
