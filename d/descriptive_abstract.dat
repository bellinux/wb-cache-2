40|$|This article reviews recent {{developments}} in multiresolution analysis which make it {{a powerful tool for}} the systematic treatment of the multiple length-scales inherent in the electronic structure of matter. Although the article focuses on electronic structure, the advances described are useful for non-linear problems in the physical sciences in general. The new language and notations introduced are well- suited for both formal manipulations and the development of computer software using higher-level languages such as C++. The discussion is self-contained, and all needed algorithms are specified explicitly in terms of simple operators and illustrated with straightforward diagrams which show the flow of data. Among the reviewed developments is the construction of_exact_ multiresolution representations from extremely limited samples of physical fields in real space. This new and profound result is the critical advance in finally allowing systematic, all electron calculations to compete in efficiency with state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations which depend for their celerity upon freezing the core electronic degrees of freedom. This review presents the theory of wavelets from a physical perspective, provides a unified and self-contained treatment of non-linear couplings and physical operators and introduces a modern framework for effective single-particle theories of quantum mechanics.

40|$|Polysubstance {{dependence}} {{has been}} associated with many neurocognitive impairments. The present study explored one of these deficits, namely conditional reasoning, using the Wason selection task. In healthy individuals, social contract and precautionary content improve conditional reasoning performance compared with <b>descriptive</b> or <b>abstract</b> content. Twenty-two recently detoxified polysubstance-dependent patients were compared with 22 controls matched for sex, age, and education level on their performance on the Wason selection task across problems involving social contract, precautionary, and descriptive conditional rules, controlling for depression, anxiety levels, and verbal intelligence. Conditional reasoning on descriptive and social contract rules was severely impaired in polysubstance-dependent patients. Precautionary reasoning was also impaired, but to a lesser degree than the other modalities of conditional reasoning. These results may reflect a toxic effect of chronic multiple-drug consumption on the prefrontal areas of the brain. Alternatively, conditional reasoning difficulties could be present, at least partially, before polysubstance dependence onset. This population may have difficulties properly understanding social contracts in real-life settings, suggesting a potential target for clinical intervention.

40|$|The whole part of {{the thesis}} is {{gathered}} and summarized in a very simple composition called abstract. Abstract contains all the information included in the thesis, to help the reader decide whether to read the entire report or not. There {{are two types of}} abstract; (1) <b>Descriptive</b> <b>abstract,</b> which contains only the outline of the whole thesis; (2) Informative abstract, which contains the further information of a thesis including the result and the conclusion. Besides, the other important thing to consider in writing an abstract is the generic structure. A good structure of an abstract consists of (1) B (Background) = some background information related to the study, (2) P (Purpose) = the principle activity (or purpose) of the study and its scope, (3) M (Methodology) = some information about the methodology used in the study, (4) R (Result) = the most important results of the study, and (5) C (Conclusion) = a statement of conclusion or recommendation of the study (Weissberg and Buker 1990 : 186). The writer observed that there have been no studies about thesis abstracts done by the English department students of Widya Mandala catholic University. Therefore, the writer conducted this study to investigate (1) the types of thesis abstracts written by the students and (2) the generic structures of thesis abstracts written by the students. In this study, the writer collected twenty theses of the English Department students year 1996 to 2006, and copied the abstracts to be the source of the study. The abstracts then analyzed based on the theories of types of abstract and generic structures of abstract. The results show that (1) the students use the Informative types of abstract; (2) There is only one abstract which is appropriate to the requirement of a good abstract stated by Weissberg and Buker (1990 : 186). Considering the results above, it can be concluded that the English Department Students of Widya Mandala Catholic University use the informative type of abstract and there are only one abstract which is appropriate to the requirement of a good abstract. This study only deals with the types of abstract and the generic structures of abstract.

It has also been observed that the relative timing of place cell firing recedes as its place field is traversed ¿ a phenomena known as phase precession. This {{has led to the}} development of a theory of theta phase coding, whereby spatial sequences being encountered on a behavioural timescale are compressed into a firing sequence of place cells which is repeated in each theta cycle and stored in an auto-associative network using spike-timing dependent plasticity. This paper provides an <b>abstract,</b> <b>descriptive</b> model of theta phase coding in a spiking neural network, and aims to investigate how learning and recall functions may be separated by the neuromodulatory action of Acetylcholine (ACh).

The education children receive from teachers we prepare will directly influence the quality of their lives: jobs, income, housing, nutrition, and social part-icipation. New evidence on the adequacy and equity of funding necessary to provide minimally adequate teach-er education reveals that generations of children will be condemned to a less-than-reasonable quality of life because of inadequately prepared teachers. I believe all faculty in our SCDEs strive to provide the best pre-paration possible for future teachers. However, what they do is fundamentally dependent on whether or not there are adequate resources available. Our profes-sion has consistently ignored the problem of establish-ing the financial standards necessary to facilitate a reasonably acceptable program.

40|$|Chapter 3 of 8. Metadata {{reflects}} a traditional notion of metadata as common <b>descriptive</b> elements <b>abstracted</b> from homogeneous collections of resources. Following this simplistic model, bibliographic terms, i. e. metadata elements, such as author, title, date, and subject can describe an collection or resource in that collection using traditional cataloging methods. Metadata {{have often been}} created to support discrete functionalities such as online discovery of large offline collections. In a world where many new library projects bring 100 % of content online and deliver that content in diverse and dynamic formats, we must expand the role of metadata as a core resource for project development and management, not just for dissemination. Recent metadata standards such as METS ([URL] provide more sophisticated descriptive elements but also reflect the increased structural and administrative metadata requirements of complex, open-ended projects consisting of complex objects. The Vivo virtual life sciences library ([URL] includes no traditional body of content and publishes no metadata in any fixed format. Vivo serves as an index that cross-references people, departments, laboratories, equipment, publications, and events that collectively comprise the Cornell Life Sciences Initiative ([URL] and related educational and research activities on three campuses. Traditional metadata elements such as authorship, organizational affiliation, and subject keywords are subsumed into ontological : : triples structured for the website database following {{the principles of the}} Harmony Project's ABC Ontology ([URL] other contemporary ontology design and integration methodologies. Many of these ontological relationships can be mined on-the-fly to produce standard metadata elements such as Dublin Core title, author, creator, or date for any object indexed in the collection, and the collection can be expanded with new types of objects and new relationships {{at any time in the}} project life cycle.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} answer the question: "What kinds of mental {{representation}} do children project and how may these be associated with their level of achievement in elementary arithmetic?". Drawing upon theories offering some explanation for {{the way in which}} arithmetical activity is transformed into numerical concepts and those that hypothesise the form and quality of mental representations the study suggests that qualitatively different kinds of mental representation may be associated with qualitatively different kinds of arithmetical behaviour. The evidence is drawn from the classification and categorisation of data from two series of semi-clinical interviews carried out with children aged eight to twelve who were at extremes of numerical achievement. The first, a pilot study, largely concentrated on mental representations associated with numerical concepts and skills. Its results suggest that mental representations projected by children may have a disposition towards different kinds of mental representation which transcends arithmetical and non-arithmetical boundaries. Issues raised by this study, in conjunction with a re-appraisal of the psychological evidence, informed the development of the main study. With a similar sample of children this considered the relationship between children's projections, reports and descriptions of mental representations in numerical and non-numerical contexts and in elementary arithmetic. Words, pictures, icons and symbols stimulated the projection of these representations. The evidence suggests that there is indeed a disposition towards the formation of particular kinds of mental representation. low achievers' projected mental representations which have descriptive emphasis. 'High achievers', whilst able to do the same, also project those with relational characteristics, the frequency of which increases as the stimulus becomes more 'language like'. This provides them with the flexibility to oscillate between <b>descriptive</b> and <b>abstract</b> levels of thought. The study indicates that qualitative different thinking in number processing is closely associated to a disposition towards qualitatively different kinds of mental representation. Its concluding comments suggest that these differences may have some considerable implication for the received belief that active methods may supply all children with a basis for numerical understanding...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> {{studies have}} been the core of {{plankton}} ecology for many decades and will surely be fruitful {{in the years to}} come. However, the results that they provide are usually very difficult to adapt for predictive purposes. Other approaches will have to be taken into account, {{in the same way that}} the use of chlorophyll a has been used as an analogue in eutrophication studies. Ecological goal functions are the most recent candidates to fulfil the need for such compounded variables in plankton research. These relate some high-order ecological functions (energy flow, information, food web inter-actions) to ecosystem performance and can be considered as indices of ecological self-organization. Our study applies the concept of goal functions, which are functions that can describe the direction of ecosystem development, to lake plankton. Thirteen gravel pit lakes in Central Spain, without plank-tivorous fish and differing in trophic status, have been selected; their plankton communities, along with abiotic factors, have been studied during late-season mixing and mid-stratification. Size-spectral features (slope and intercept of the normalized biomass size spectrum), emergy (the quality of energy that increases since it is capable of controlling and causing work in the pelagic environment that would otherwise not be possible), exergy (the actual free energy of plankton biomass, including the free energy stored in information) and size-based connectance of food webs have been calculated o...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} with {{cavitation}} in pumps and other hydraulic devices {{is that there}} is no effective method for detecting or predicting its inception. The traditional approach is to declare the pump in cavitation when the total head pressure drops by some arbitrary value (typically 3 o/ 0) in response to a reduction in pump inlet pressure. However, the pump is already cavitating at this point. A method is needed in which cavitation events are captured as they occur and characterized by their process dynamics. The object of this research was to identify specific features of cavitation that could be used as a model-based descriptor in a context-dependent condition-based maintenance (CD-CBM) anticipatory prognostic and health assessment model. This descriptor was based on the physics of the phenomena, capturing the salient features of the process dynamics. An important element of this concept is the development and formulation of the extended process feature vector @) or model vector. Thk model-based descriptor encodes the specific information that describes the phenomena and its dynamics and is formulated as a data structure consisting of several elements. The first is a <b>descriptive</b> model <b>abstracting</b> the phenomena. The second is the parameter list associated with the functional model. The third is a figure of merit, a single number between [0, 1] representing a confidence factor that the functional model and parameter list actually describes the observed data. Using this as a basis and applying it to the cavitation problem, any given location in a flow loop will have this data structure, differing in value but not content. The extended process feature vector is formulated as follows: E`> [, {parameter Iist}, confidence factor]. (1) For this study, the model that characterized cavitation was a chirped-exponentially decaying sinusoid. Using the parameters defined by this model, the parameter list included frequency, decay, and chirp rate. Based on this, the process feature vector has the form: @=> [, { 01 = a, ~= b, ~ = c}, cf = 0. 80]. (2) In this experiment a reversible catastrophe was examined. The reason for this is that the same catastrophe could be repeated to ensure the statistical significance of the data...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{ethnic and}} {{religious}} groups share the limited public space of Old Dhaka for socio-cultural, religious, commercial activities and also for everyday traffic. Shared understanding across religious and cultural groups {{of the purposes of}} certain streets, negotiation between users of the street, and tacit agreement on spatial use, describe some of the mechanisms that allow the very intensive use of the street network. Yet this sharing of the public space co-exists with a sense of belonging and spatial focus for Old Dhaka communities. This thesis examines these mechanisms of space sharing firstly by trying to understand how local groups perceive the streets and their degree of involvement in the activities that take place there. Secondly, the details of space self-management are examined in a sample of streets. Thirdly, the roles of informal communications between authorities, landholders and street users were assessed. Old Dhaka, has almost no shared public spaces except its community streets. Competition for the available space by myriad groups has led to a highly complex spatial and temporal formula for sharing all of the important streets. For commercial use, the rule of sharing space between formal and informal sectors is highly uniform in practice. This necessary sharing of space explains the remarkable social harmony of this crowded and diverse urban community. This harmony, however, is challenged by the increasing heterogeneity of the community and a tendency to territorialize parts of this shared public space. Innovative methods for capturing the use of space were necessary in this research and were developed prior to entering the field. Indeed, there are only rare examples in the literature. Existing major behavior recording methods are either too <b>descriptive</b> or <b>abstract</b> and also lack transferability. This thesis developed a method for recording behavior that fulfils a need in existing methods. Unobtrusive observation, key informant interviews, structured questionnaires, and a photographic survey were the major methods of investigation and data collection. This research provides insights on the mechanisms of space sharing as well as the control system, motivations for personal choices and a spatially based sense of belonging. Key words: Behavior pattern, shared space, urban street, spatial qualitie...|$|R
40|$|This exegesis has {{two main}} objectives, one to {{elucidate}} the paintings and prints, grouped into a relatively coherent {{body of work}} under the general title Coastal Architecture, {{and the other to}} establish a theoretical foundation and context for both the artistic production and the critical reception of the work. Two notoriously difficult and complex ideas - landscape and abstraction - are brought together in the studio work and then dismantled and examined in the writing. In the progressive exploration of different aspects of these two key terms a number of questions arise. For example, what is the relation of visual to verbal metaphor? Can abstraction be thought of outside its conventional opposition to figuration or mimesis? Can a work be <b>descriptive</b> and <b>abstract</b> at the same time? If the figure can be in the landscape, can the body be in the painting? What new experiences and meanings can be brought to the landscape genre that, in the view of many art theorists, has fallen into disuse or worse? In order to systematically answer these questions I have looked to the writing of American philosopher John R. Searle to provide a foundation for a theory of realism that rejects the idealism and phenomenological bent of much poststructuralist art theory. I have taken a critical analytic approach to some recent ideological critiques of landscape in order to escape their pessimism and limited perspective on contemporary landscape painting. Alongside Robert Rosenblum’s celebrated tradition of the Abstract Sublime I assert a parallel, unbroken empirical tradition of 20 th Century modern landscape art, both figurative and abstract, looking at some of its key breaks with tradition in Pollock and post- 1970 s conceptual art. The importance of point of view and bodily orientation is examined historically and then applied to the work in Coastal Architecture. Drawing on gestalt theory, semiotics, Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwins’ concept of modality markers and John Searle’s notion of aspects in consciousness, I attempt to demystify the ‘language’ of abstraction by seeing it as a non-mysterious modality within the overall communicative matrix of painting. In Chapter 6 I extend the discussion of point-of-view by looking at the theme of the figure in the landscape in post- WWII Australian figurative painting in relation to the more elusive notion of the body in abstract painting. Anthropomorphism in contrast to the body as a dispersed or textural presence is considered. The final chapter organises Coastal Architecture into groups and investigates the use of analogical structures or metaphors that manipulate the organic and the fabricated into new landscapes...|$|R
