50|$|Stone {{quarrying}} {{was a major}} {{industry in}} Grenoside from a very early date until it ceased in 1939. The stone quarried in Grenoside varied in quality and was put to several uses. The finer grained, hard stones were much in demand as grindstones for the cutlery trade and for fine fettling and finishing in iron foundries. Coarse <b>grained</b> <b>stone</b> was used for furnace lining and from these were hewn the stone boxes used in the Cementation process of steelmaking. In 1860 the following are named as quarry owners in Grenoside - Thomas Beever, George Broadhead, George Firth, Thomas Lint, Joseph Swift and Charles Uttley.|$|E
5000|$|In {{accordance}} with Jefferson's request, Isaac Briggs used a transit and equal altitude instrument (see Theodolite) to survey a new meridian line extending south {{from the center}} of the President's House that intersected a line extending due west from the planned center of the Capitol building. On October 15, 1804, Nicholas King, Surveyor of the City of Washington, erected at the intersection [...] "a small pier, covered by a flat free stone, on which the lines are drawn." [...] This established the Washington Meridian (sometimes termed the [...] "16th Street Meridian"), now at a longitude 77°2'11.56" [...] (NAD 83) west of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The pier and stone were located at the point that L'Enfant's plan had identified as being the future site of George Washington's equestrian statue. A pier is a massive pillar capable of supporting a great weight. Most of the length of a surveying pier is buried vertically in the ground for stability. Free stone is fine <b>grained</b> <b>stone</b> soft enough to carve with a chisel, yet has no tendency to split in any preferential direction.|$|E
50|$|According to Cousens, the doorpost {{mouldings}} on {{the southern}} and eastern doorway are worthy of mention. On {{both sides of the}} southern doorway are four inner bands of scrolls which run up the sides and around {{the lower part of the}} entablature above. Next to these bands, on either side, in the centre, are tall columns or pilasters supporting the lower cornice above. Beyond these columns, on either side, are four more bands of decorative mouldings. On the lintel of the doorway is a dedicatory block containing an image of Gaja-Lakshmi with an elephant on either side. In fact, in the Kannada spoken regions, it is common to find the image of Lakshmi in the dedicatory block on the lintel irrespective of the temple's original dedication; whether the principal deity was Shiva, Vishnu or Jaina. Above the lower cornice, the entablature consists of small figures, now numbering only three (must have been eleven originally) standing under cusped arches. Above these figures is a valance of beads hanging in festoons. According to art historian Cousens, the decoration on the eastern doorway, though not a fine as {{on the southern}} doorway, is worthy of praise for its filigree work. The doorway to the shrine (sanctum) rivals the exterior ones in finish. The dedicatory block on the lintel has an image of Gaja-Lakshmi and her elephants. Above the cornice is a procession of men and animals. These images, which are barely six inches tall, include horsemen and musicians. Above these images are the trinity of Hindu gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.The ornamentation on the outer wall of the shrine consists of prominent central niches above which is a miniature tower (shikhara or aedicule) which is purely nagara (north Indian) in style and cuts through the principal cornice. The decorative arch above the miniature tower is a conspicuous ornamental feature of the superstructure. The miniature tower - arch combination is repeated up the superstructure of the shrine. The finial (kalasha) and the capping structure of the tower is missing. In the temple hall, the pillars, their capital, and brackets figures above the capital (which include little lions, kirtimukhas and scrolls) are evidence of expert workmanship, the kind found on ivory or silver. The artisans fully availed the workable properties of finely <b>grained</b> <b>stone</b> (soapstone) to produce polished pillars whose shafts have a rounded appearance obtained by using a lathe.|$|E

30|$|There is {{variation}} in the sorptivity of the sandstone samples tested, undoubtedly linked to their textural and microstructure properties. Stanton Moor sandstone, which is fine to medium grained with an open porosity of 13.71 % [39], has a lower sorptivity than Locharbriggs, a medium <b>grained</b> <b>stone</b> with 19.02 % open porosity [40]. Lithomex sorptivity falls below both sandstones while Conserv is significantly higher.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{building}} constructed using local stone with a welsh slate roof covering. It has a main two-storey range, a single storey platform range, a two-storey wing {{attached to the}} main range and a service yard. It has a polite Italianate façade {{on the road and}} railway faces, which are the public faces, finished using high quality stonework. The less public faces are finished using a coarser <b>grained</b> <b>stone.</b> SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS This building is typical of the wayside stations built during the railway mania of the middle and late 19 th Century. Castle Howard Station House is different from the other wayside stations in the way it was finished. This {{is believed to have been}} an effort to impress the Earl of Carlisle who used the station as his railhead; the land on which the station stands was originally purchased from the Castle Howard Estate. The building has been designed to accommodate a number of functions. It provides domestic accommodation for the stationmaster, accommodation for the railway business, provides for the needs of waiting passengers and provided a private waiting room for the Earl of Carlisle. Station House survives in a condition, which is very close to its ‘as-built ’ form. There hav...|$|E

5000|$|When {{the block}} is {{intended}} for installation on a bench it is called a bench stone. Small, portable stones (commonly made of bonded abrasive) are called pocket stones. Being smaller, they are more portable than bench stones but present difficulty in maintaining a consistent angle and pressure when drawing the stone along larger blades. However, they still can form a good edge. Frequently, fine <b>grained</b> pocket <b>stones</b> are used for honing, especially [...] "in the field". Despite being a homophone with wet in most dialects of modern English, whetstones {{do not need to}} be lubricated with oil or water, although it is very common to do so. Lubrication aids the cutting action and carries swarf away.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{most of the}} P. M. & B. quarry the {{limestone}} has a uniform fine grain, {{with only a few}} irregular patches of coarser <b>grained</b> and crystalline <b>stone.</b> The fine <b>grained</b> oolitic limestone that is quarried from this site is covered by a layer of Mitchell limestone in some places. Although this covering layer can be difficult to remove by quarry workers, it has acted as a protective barrier for the underlying oolitic limestone and aides in preserving its high quality.|$|R
5000|$|The stela {{is a large}} block below, (a plinth) {{connected}} to a thinner block with a curved top. The dimensions are a height of 35 12/16 inch and a width of 13 ¼ inch. The piece was made from one huge block of fine <b>grained,</b> hard, gray-green <b>stone</b> made from greywacke. The stela is well preserved {{with only a few}} small visible chips. It seems to have been created with exact precision and care therefore making it a most intriguing and valuable addition to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|R
40|$|Few {{scientific}} works {{deal with}} size effect on mechanical {{resistance in the}} case of stone, but for the concrete size effect has been widely verified. In fact, the stone size effect is not always ruled by well-known statistical laws as Weibull because of the intrinsic complex structure and features of the materials analysed. Previous studies on natural stone size effect have been made mainly taking into account compression strength. However, flexural strength test under concentrated load, according EN 12372, is applied to assess the mechanical resistance of stone and it is well correlated with the petrographic properties of stone. For this reason, to further investigate the size effect on stone, this research analyses the variation of mechanical resistance in relation to thickness of the specimens, taking into account the petrographic characteristics (mineralogical composition, heterogeneity, anisotropy, porosity) of different kinds of rock. From previous studies on 15 different stones (Bellopede et al. 2015) it was observed a negligible values variation for different thickness and a data scattering caused by: intrinsic properties (porosity and structure), defects distribution (fractures, cracks, voids), heterogeneity characterizing each specimen. According to EN 12372 : 2006, the suggested dimensions for the determination of flexural strength under concentrated load are 50 x 50 x 300 mm. Other dimensions are possible, but the following requirement need to be fulfilled. The thickness should be minimum 25 mm and maximum 100 mm, the width should be within 50 mm and 3 times the thickness and the distance between the supporting rollers span should be 5 times the thickness. In this research, in order to further investigate the thickness effect even in relation with the stone structure and heterogeneity, eight different stones have been tested: four with anisotropic features and four homogeneous. The distance between the support knife was equal to 2 / 3 to specimens length. The thickness effect on the flexural strength of most of the material tested is negligible considering the uncertainty (except for gneiss). From the data obtained some remarks has been found on the test methodology and on the specimens thickness. Moreover, in view of obtaining reliable data with low uncertainty by means of flexural strength test, a minimum thickness specimen both for fine and coarse <b>grained</b> <b>stones</b> has been detecte...|$|R
50|$|Chromolithography is a {{chemical}} process. The process {{is based on}} the rejection of grease by water. The image is applied to <b>stone,</b> <b>grained</b> zinc or aluminium surfaces, with a grease-based crayon or ink. Limestone and zinc are two commonly used materials in the production of chromolithographs, as aluminium unfortunately corrodes easily. After the image is drawn onto one of these surfaces, the image is gummed-up with a gum arabic solution and weak nitric acid to desensitize the surface. Before printing, the image is proved before finally inking up the image with oil based transfer or printing ink. The inked image under pressure is transposed onto a sheet of paper using a flat-bed press. This describes the direct form of printing. The offset indirect method uses a rubber-covered cylinder that transfers the image from printing surface to the paper. Colours may be overprinted by using additional stones or plates to achieve a closer reproduction of the original. Accurate registration for multi-coloured work is achieved by the use of a key outline image and registration bars which are applied to each stone or plate before drawing the solid or tone image. Ben-Day medium, uses a raised gelatin stipple image to give tone gradation. An air-brush sprays ink to give soft edges. These are just two methods used to achieve gradations of tone. The use of twelve overprinted colours would not be considered unusual. Each sheet of paper will therefore pass through the printing press as many times as there are colours in the final print. In order that each colour is placed in the right position, each stone or plate must be precisely ‘registered,’ or lined up, on the paper using a system of register marks.|$|R
