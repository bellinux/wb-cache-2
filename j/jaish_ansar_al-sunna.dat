50|$|<b>Jaish</b> <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> claimed {{responsibility}} for several suicide bombings in Iraq, including the devastating attacks on the offices of two main Kurdish political parties, KDP and PUK, in Irbil on February 1, 2004, that killed at least 109 people. The strikes {{were one of the}} bloodiest attacks launched by insurgents {{since the start of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|In September 2003, {{members of}} Ansar al-Islam {{who had fled}} to Iran after the 2003 joint {{operation}} by Iraqi and US forces against them announced {{the creation of a}} group called Jamaat <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna,</b> which was dedicated to expelling U.S. occupation forces from Iraq. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> became a prominent insurgent group active in the so-called Sunni Triangle, carrying out kidnappings, suicide bombings and guerilla attacks.|$|R
50|$|The United States and Iraqi Interim governments linked <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> with Abu Musab al-Zarqawis, Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (al-Qaeda in Iraq). In October 2004 <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> {{released}} a video beheading of a Turkish truck driver on its website. The kidnappers {{on the video}} identified themselves as members of al-Tawhid wal Jihad (Source: MERIA).

The new alliance was composed of seven groupings explicitly excluding al-Qaeda and the Baath-party. This delimitation revealed a split between al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sunna over tactics, alleged attacks on Iraqi Shia civilians being a main point of difference.|$|E

In 2007, it split into two groups in 2007; one began operating under the name Ansar al-Islam, and the second group called itself Ansar al-Sunnah Shariah Comitee, before changing its name to Ansar al-Ahlu Sunnah in 2011.|$|E

Three groups, (AQI, IAI and the National Islamic Army (1920 Revolution Brigade)) had their nationwide headquarters in Fallujah.

5000|$|Al Jazeera {{broadcast}} {{a video of}} Hassoun on June 27, 2004, blindfolded and with a masked man holding a sword over his head, {{saying that he had}} been captured. His [...] "kidnappers" [...] identified themselves as part of [...] "Islamic Response", the security wing of the [...] "National Islamic Resistance" [...] 1920 Revolution Brigades. On July 3, 2004, Al Jazeera reported that the terrorist group <b>Jaish</b> <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> had released a statement declaring they had beheaded Hassoun, and their website confirmed this. On July 4 it was reported al-Sunna denied this, and on July 6, Al Jazeera reported receipt of a message he'd been [...] "taken to a safe location" [...] after he promised to desert from the U.S. Marine Corps. On July 7, CNN reported that Hassoun had contacted his family in West Jordan, Utah and Lebanon from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, asking to be picked up at an unspecified location. The Houston Chronicle stated later that afternoon his family, as well as the embassy in question, deny that the telephone call had taken place.|$|E
50|$|The Sunni—I was {{impressed}}, by the way, by the Speaker—Denny Hastert told me I'd like him; Denny {{met with}} him. And I {{was impressed by}} him. He's a fellow that had been put in prison by Saddam and, interestingly enough, put in prison by us. And he {{made a decision to}} participate in the government. And he was an articulate person. He talked about running the parliament. It was interesting to see a person that could have been really bitter talk about the skills he's going to need to bring people together to run the parliament. And I found him to be a hopeful person.They tell me that he wouldn't have taken my phone call a year ago—I think I might have shared this with you at one point in time—and there I was, sitting next to the guy. And I think he enjoyed it as much as I did. It was a refreshing moment.According to senior Iraq government officials, Dr. Mashhadani had been imprisoned by the United States because of his affiliations with Ansar al-Islam and <b>Jaish</b> <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} three weeks, 76 bodies of {{executed}} Iraqi soldiers were found throughout the city. 122 people were killed during the street fighting; 4 U.S. soldiers, 31 members of the Iraqi security forces, 9 Kurdish peshmerga fighters, at least 71 insurgents, five civilians, one British security contractor, and one Turkish truck driver. With that the final death toll of the insurgent uprising in Mosul is an estimated 198 killed. However, other estimates are much higher and other sources say many more insurgents and civilians {{were killed in the}} battle. Actual casualty figures remain unknown. The insurgents managed to make a safe haven out of {{the western part of the}} city from where they continued to conduct hit and run attacks over the coming months. One of the more notable attacks came just a month after the fighting ceased, when a suicide bomber dressed like an Iraqi soldier managed to get into the mess tent on an American base called Forward Operating Base Marez, and detonated himself - killing 22 people, including 14 American soldiers. The insurgent group known as <b>Jaish</b> <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sunna</b> claimed responsibility for the attack. The battle resulted in the city complement of security forces deserting leaving the area insecure. The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) was on their own in the city until they were able to build up the Iraqi Police and Iraqi Military presence once again.|$|E
