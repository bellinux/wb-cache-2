This approach differs from the known (existing) evaluations of exactness of measurings, which it was assumed at, that constituents had normal distribution, which {{does not depend on}} the type of distributing of constituents, influencing on a result. For this purpose as an initial size the function of belonging, the special case of which is probability, which interval estimations, uniting subjective and experimental information, were got at, was utillized. The got results became basis of principles of construction informatively of the measurings systems with the use of conception of vagueness for the increase of exactness of estimation of results of the control measurings of parameters of informing signals with the use of individual signs of signals, that will allow considerably to promote reliability of methodology of synthesis of regulation signals and analysis of their informative constituent.
