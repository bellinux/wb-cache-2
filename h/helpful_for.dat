5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may be <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron {{has some}} utility, {{with a single}} dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E

5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> the development of Darwin's theory. This {{was the beginning of}} an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E

5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps {{two weeks after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. He began flight {{training}} in January 1942, in spite of being two months older than the cutoff age of 26, as the desperate need for pilots combined with Sebille's skills as a pilot allowed him to waive the age restriction. During that time he was described as an outstanding pilot and leader, and his maturity was <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> the younger flight trainees. After completing flight training, Sebille was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 450th Bombardment Squadron, 322nd Bombardment Group 3rd Bombardment Wing at MacDill Field, Florida. Sebille flew B-26 Marauder aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|Anton is a {{special-purpose}} supercomputer {{built for}} molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-µs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success {{in his new}} role, {{learning}} Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan self-governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was <b>helpful</b> <b>for</b> carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E
