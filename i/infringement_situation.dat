40|$|We {{see them}} everywhere. They carry {{significant}} values. All companies have one. Many companies build their business around one. This {{is what we}} call a trademark. The trademark is a mark for recognition and functions as a warranty for survival and continuous income which makes companies invest heavily in it. The biggest, currently existing, threat to trademarks is infringements. Infringements have grown into a significant multinational organized criminality. One of the reasons is that it is cheap to infringe. Currently, the damages provision in the Trademark Act is frequently discussed and criticized. In order to investigate whether this criticism is justified, this master thesis aims to compare the prevailing legal situation of trademark infringement damages to the needs and requirements of active trademark rightholders. The result illustrates that the damages in practice fail to repair the rightholder’s injury caused by the infringement as well as to prevent the potential infringer from infringing. The paper accordingly illustrates why the intended functions of the damages are not fulfilled, where the system fails and what consequences such failure has. From case law, legal doctrine and public press I have been able to extract a number of methods for calculating and supporting damages caused by trademark infringements. The intention is for it to function as a tool for rightholders when determining which method is most appropriate for their specific <b>infringement</b> <b>situation.</b> MSc in Intellectual Capital Managemen...|$|E
40|$|Patent trolls (or sharks) {{are small}} patent holding {{individuals}} or firms who trap R&D intense manufacturers in patent <b>infringement</b> <b>situations</b> {{in order to}} receive damage awards for the illegitimate use of their technology. While of great concern to management, their existence and impact for both corporate decision makers and policy makers remains to be fully analyzed from an academic standpoint. In this paper we show why patent sharks can operate profitably, why they are of growing concern, how manufacturers can forearm themselves against them, and which issues policy makers need to address. To do so, we map international indemnification rules with strategic rationales of small patent-holding firms within a game-theoretical model. Our central finding is that the courts’ unrealistic consideration of the trade-offs faced by inadvertent infringers is a central condition for sharks to operate profitably.

50|$|The {{question}} of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should {{be held liable for}} the actions of network users is unresolved. As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an <b>infringement</b> action. This <b>situation</b> is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.|$|R

40|$|The European Union, {{with only}} 7. 5 % of the world’s population, is {{responsible}} for {{a major part of}} the contamination of the planet, and is a major contributor to the problems of the global environment. Fortunately, Europe has both the capacity and the experience to fight effectively against these problems, even in this ‘twenty-fifth hour’ of environmental degradation. This timely book identifies some of the weaknesses of the public enforcement mechanism inherent in Articles 258 – 260 TFEU, and suggests how that mechanism could be improved in order to promote the overall effectiveness of EU law and environmental law in particular. Starting from the idea that the European Union lacks a strong enforcement body to prevent Member States from exploiting loopholes in its legal system, the author thoroughly investigates the extent to which the effectiveness of the EU’s public enforcement provisions depends on voluntary compliance or on actual enforcement mechanisms. He shows that, while preventive procedures should always precede enforcement actions, European environmental law cannot be sufficiently promoted without stronger legal enforcement measures. Reviewing both the managerial methods and the enforcement mechanisms that the Commission can resort to, he examines such issues as the following: [...] why environmental protection issues produce the most problems with regard to enforcement; [...] reasons for non-compliance, types of breaches, and how breaches are detected; [...] the different stages of the infringement procedures under Articles 258 - 260; [...] method of calculating penalties; [...] schedules and time limits for compliance; [...] lines of defence Member States resort to in an <b>infringement</b> case; [...] <b>situations</b> where legal arguments are likely to be left behind by political considerations; [...] limits on the powers of the Commission and the ECJ; [...] when the ECJ can impose a higher penalty than in the original claim; and [...] what happens when a Member State fails to pay a penalty. The analysis covers the range of instruments, programmes, and institutions used by the EU to promote compliance with environmental law, such as LIFE, IMPEL, training and education schemes, and various financial tools, and also describes the role of the European Environment Agency and other statutory bodies. Detailed studies of cases which have arisen under Article 228 EC (now Article 260 TFEU) underpin the analysis, revealing common issues and emerging principles. An in-depth study of available approaches under EU law to effective recognition of environmental imperatives and better compliance with existing provisions, this important book offers practical recommendations that will improve and speed up infringement proceedings and strengthen both preventive measures and enforcement mechanisms. It is an essential resource for European lawyers and policymakers concerned with preventing further irreparable damage to our environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} topic of compensating losses caused by infringements of EU competition law. In particular, {{the focus is on}} the relationship and on the “mixture” of EU and national law in that context. The topic is dealt with by studying, on the one hand, EU law and, on the other hand, Finnish law as a national legal order. The main method is the theoretical legal dogmatic method but some parts (for instance, Sections II–III and VII) are also characterized by the interpretive or practical legal dogmatic method. Additionally, law and economics and law and language approaches have had some impact on the work. In the absence of material EU rules on the matter, it is for national legal orders to provide remedies and procedures for safeguarding the rights conferred on individuals by EU law. This is, somewhat misleadingly, also called the procedural autonomy of the Member States. National law fills in the gaps left by EU law so that, for instance, the law applicable to a dispute involving damages claims related to infringements of EU rights is a mixture of EU law and national law. In addition to being a combination of material rules of different legal orders, the mixture is complicated by the fact that even when national rules apply, it may be necessary to adapt them to meet the requirements set by EU law. Regarding reacting to infringements of EU law in areas of law where the EU legal order does not legislate the means of reacting and procedures for doing so exhaustively – which is very often the case – it is not possible to easily discern the applicable material rules and their meaning. Instead of being a clear set of stable rules, the law applicable to compensating losses caused by infringements of EU competition law is a dynamic mass of principles and rules of both the EU and national legal orders. It can be noted in both European and Finnish legal discussion that great inability arises in pointing out the applicable rules of law and their meaning. For this reason, discussion and assumptions on the content of applicable rules are vague. Furthermore, statements made on the meaning of applicable law without paying attention to the conundrum of concurrent norms and principles of EU and national law may be incorrect. This dissertation aims to find a way or a model for structuring and discerning the applicable pieces of law, and finally: the content and meaning of law in a situation where damages are claimed (in Finland) in the context of infringements of EU competition law. To achieve this goal, EU requirements for national law that safeguards EU rights and regulates reactions to infringements of those rights is studied closely. Central issues for this work include so-called procedural autonomy case-law and other EU law on the interaction of EU law with national legal orders, and how all this is to be seen in the context of competition law infringements. In addition to principles and requirements of EU law, relevant material rules on damages must also be and are taken into account as a part of the whole of the relevant EU law. Moreover, because EU principles and requirements are content- or result-oriented, material national rules are studied in order to see how the combination of EU and national law is actually formed. Regarding the requirements that EU law sets for national law, it is of importance that the issue whether something exists that should be regarded as an EU right to damages under competition law, which would be subject to the EU requirements applicable to (upholding or maintaining) EU rights as defined in EU law, can be considered obscure. For instance, a plenitude of legal discussion is available that mentions the right to damages in this context and thus departs, either knowingly or not, from a rational starting point that damages actions or compensation should be regarded as something that is subject to the EU requirements that relate to remedies in situations where an EU right is infringed. The question as to under which EU law requirements the issue of competition infringement damages should be dealt with is a central one, since an alleged “right to damages under competition law” should, in national courts, be upheld as it appears in EU law – which might necessitate disapplying a great amount of national law. Moreover, the task of upholding would be quite challenging, since significant parts of such a “right” are not yet visible in EU law. If the EU requirements on remedies and procedural autonomy principles that regulate reacting to infringements of EU rights were to apply to compensating damages related to competition infringements, that is, if damages were to be considered a mere remedy from the point of view of EU requirements, there could also be some variation in deciding relevant competition infringement-related cases in national courts. National law could be applied as long as it were not contradictory in relation to the few material rules discernible in EU (case-) law and as long as national law were in accordance with the EU law requirements – in the context of remedies: principles of equality, effectiveness and of adequate judicial protection. In this dissertation, the issue whether the requirements for upholding EU rights or the requirements relating traditionally to (reactive or reparatory) remedies apply to damages under EU competition law is studied by analyzing the relevant concepts and requirements in EU case-law. Even though the concept of rights and their relationship to remedies are unclear issues in EU law, it is submitted that damages under EU competition law are to be evaluated according to the requirements applicable to remedies. Moreover, in competition <b>infringement</b> <b>situations,</b> the EU right that must be upheld is not that of damages but a right to a competitive and undistorted Internal Market. It is argued that the “rights language” of the Court of Justice of the EU in the context of competition infringement damages does not refer to a particular right to damages but represents standard language (not a particular legal definition) or refers to the above-mentioned right to competitive markets. The model for structuring and discerning the applicable law in competition infringement damages cases is constructed by distinguishing between EU law requirements for rights, (reactive or reparatory) remedies, and procedural rules, and viewing damages for competition infringements as a (reactive or reparatory) remedy. On the basis of the analysis, it is submitted that each sub-issue of a damages claim case, such as a condition for reparation (e. g., causal link), should be evaluated by first surveying the possibly applicable material EU law rules (both in the specific context of competition infringement damages and more broadly), and then analyzing the compatibility of national rules with the material rules. After this one should continue by surveying the discernible significance of the relevant EU law requirements in the context of that particular sub-issue, and then analyzing what the EU law requirements mean in the context of relevant and (taking into account the material EU rules) still eligible national rules, assessing whether the rules may be applied as such and whether, for instance, it is necessary to interpret them in a certain way to fulfill the requirements of EU law on remedies. The model for structuring and discerning the applicable law is applied for short and exemplary analyses of certain conditions for awarding damages, taking the reader through the relevant EU law and Finnish law as the model suggests. Conclusions of the research include the observation that structured and organized analysis of EU law and national law is possible and advisable in the context of competition infringement damages. Studying the combination of EU law and national law according to the model reveals that Finland’s, or any other Member State’s, law may be compatible with EU law also in such contexts where other descriptions of EU law and its requirements would have led to a different result. Requiring fault and law relating to it is an illustrative example of this. Regarding possible erroneous findings of incompatibility, also unnecessary adaption of national law “to suit the requirements of EU law” could constitute a problem in administration of justice, because it would lead to decisions that are not really based on law and which would, moreover, be problematic from the point of view of legal certainty. The applicable material rules and their contents vary over time but the basic principles for discerning the common meaning of EU and national law, as well as the fact that reacting to infringements of an EU right (to an undistorted Internal Market) is regulated by a combination of EU and national legal orders, are more permanent. The European Commission’s new (2013) proposal for a directive relating to competition infringement damages claims shows that many significant aspects of damages claims are going to be governed by national law and EU limits on national law – that is, a complex combination of EU law and national law – also in the future. Analysis based on a similar model as constructed in the dissertation is also likely to be useful, for instance, regarding other contexts where claims for damages are based on EU law in horizontal relationships. Suomenkielinen yleistajuinen tiivistelmä Väitöskirjassa tarkastellaan EU:n kilpailuoikeuden rikkomiseen liittyviin vahingonkorvausasioihin soveltuvaa oikeutta. EU:n kilpailuoikeuden vastaisia järjestelyjä ovat elinkeinonharjoittajien väliset kilpailua rajoittavat sopimukset, kuten kartellit, ja määräävän markkina-aseman väärinkäyttö. Lainvastaisista kilpailunrajoituksista voi aiheutua erilaisille tahoille vahinkoa muun muassa maksettuna ylihintana tai tulon menetyksenä. EU:n kilpailuoikeuden rikkomiseen liittyvät korvausvaatimukset käsitellään kansallisissa tuomioistuimissa, joiden on sovellettava tässä yhteydessä riitoihin EU-oikeuden ja kansallisen oikeuden yhdistelmää. EU:n kilpailuoikeus, EU-oikeuden tavoitteet ja periaatteet yhtäältä ja kansalliset oikeuskeinot, vahingonkorvausoikeus ja prosessioikeus toisaalta muodostavat monitahoisen ja epäkoherentin oikeusnormimassan. Sääntelykokonaisuus on paikoin jopa ristiriitainen ja monilta osin avoin. Kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen yksityiskohtiin soveltuvien normien löytäminen EU:n ja kansallisen normiston akselilta ei ole yksinkertaista. EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden välillä voidaan katsoa olevan epäselvä siirtymäalue, jolla kyse ei ole vain jommankumman normiston soveltumisesta, vaan paremminkin normistojen sekoitussuhteesta. EU-oikeuden vaikutustapojen ja vaatimusten merkityksen tunnistaminen on EU-oikeuden materiaalisten sääntöjen huomioon ottamisen ohella välttämätön edellytys sille, että kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen yhteydessä relevantin oikeuden sisällöstä voidaan perustellusti keskustella. Oikeustieteellisessä keskustelussa on ollut yleistä, ettei EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden keskinäissuhdetta ja siten myöskään yksityiskohtaista korvaukseen soveltuvaa oikeutta pystytä kuvaamaan perustellusti ja selvästi. Myös tuomioistuimilla voi olla vaikeuksia relevantin oikeuden hahmottamisessa. Väitöskirjassa esitetään EU:n ja Suomen oikeuden yhdessä muodostamaan kokonaisuuteen pureutuen, miten EU-oikeuden ja kansallisen oikeuden yhdistelmää olisi jäsennettävä, jotta lopullisia kansallisessa tuomioistuimessa vahingonkorvausasiaan soveltuvia normeja voitaisiin kuvata pätevästi. Tarkastelussa käytetyt metodit ovat erityisesti teoreettinen lainoppi ja lainoppi. Myös esimerkiksi oikeustaloustieteellisellä analyysillä ja oikeuden ja kielen analyysillä on työssä paikoin merkitystä. Tutkimuksessa syvennytään EU-oikeudesta, lähinnä oikeustapauksista, löytyviin materiaalisiin sääntöihin ja analysoidaan EU-oikeuden kansalliselle oikeudelle asettamia hyväksyttävyyden rajoja. Kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen kannalta relevanttia EU-oikeutta ja EU-oikeuden tarkoituksen asianmukaista toteuttamista tutkitaan ottamalla huomioon vahingonkorvauksen yleisempi asema EU-oikeudessa ja kansallisten tuomioistuinten voimakkaat velvollisuudet edistää EU-oikeuden tavoitteisiin pääsyä. Näin voidaan selvittää, miltä osin kansallinen oikeus voi yhä soveltua EU:n kilpailuoikeuteen perustuviin korvausvaatimuksiin ja miten kansallista oikeutta on tässä yhteydessä tulkittava. EU-oikeudellisen analyysin jälkeen väitöskirjassa toteutetaan esimerkinomaisia tarkasteluja EU:n ja Suomen oikeuden muodostamasta kokonaisuudesta kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen maksamisen edellytysten yhteydessä. Tutkimuksen keskeisiin tuloksiin lukeutuu se, että EU-kilpailuoikeuteen liittyviin korvausvaatimuksiin sovellettavat kansalliset säännöt voivat ilmeisesti vaihdella EU:n jäsenvaltiosta toiseen joiltain osin enemmän kuin aiemmin on oletettu. Asianmukainen EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden raja-alueen tarkastelu edistää myös oikeusaukkojen paikantamista ja yksilöintiä. EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden järjestelmällinen jäsentäminen on mahdollista ja suositeltavaa jäsenvaltioiden tuomioistuimissa käsiteltäviä EU-oikeuteen perustuvia vaatimuksia analysoitaessa...|$|R
