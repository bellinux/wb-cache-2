5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E

5|$|Gilly {{starts to}} date Lynsey, he {{initially}} thinks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> soon after Steph's death. He is shocked when {{she finds a}} lump and it halts their relationship.

5|$|Les Amis says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> late to {{save the}} sector of Bersée, which {{was removed from the}} race because of its {{dangerous}} state in 2007. The situation is becoming critical, it says, at the Pont Gibus at Wallers, at Mons-en-Pévèle, Pont Thibaut at Ennevelin, the pavé of the Duclos-Lassalle section at Cysoing, and at Camphin-en-Pévèle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} revamp her {{wardrobe}} after her separation from Roy Anderson and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes are {{shipped to the}} office, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show to show off a new blouse. When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> revealing.|$|E

5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead {{that it should}} be considered an inner Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|As {{the four}} pack up their {{respective}} apartments—Rachel, in particular, displeased {{about having to}} switch—Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> soon for a result. Later with packing complete, Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test. The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter, Lisa, (Allyce Beasley) {{arrives with}} her fiancé, Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a {{door-to-door}} salesman who {{turns out to}} be abrasive and insensitive. Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> late.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{thinking}} that the FBI agent {{is part of a}} government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died.|$|E

5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> late.|$|E
5|$|Large scale protests, demonstrations, {{and other}} gatherings {{directly}} on First Avenue are rare. Some gatherings {{have taken place}} in Ralph Bunche Park, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small to accommodate large demonstrations. The closest location where the New York City Police Department usually allows demonstrators is Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza at 47th Street and First Avenue, one block away from the visitors' entrance, four blocks away from the entrance used by top-level diplomats, and five blocks away from the general staff entrance.|$|E
5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
