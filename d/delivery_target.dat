40|$|A {{turbulent}} {{manufacturing environment}} where uncertainty is inevitable {{does not allow}} for the availability of the required materials and resources when they are needed. This paper studies the implications of demand surges, lead-time variations and resources breakdown on the ability of a manufacturing system to achieve its <b>delivery</b> <b>target.</b> Simulation modelling was used to represent a stochastic manufacturing system, which is disturbed by these uncertainties. Manufacturing systems each with and without intelligent feedback were modelled. An intelligent feedback is represented via a set of algorithm, which reanalyse and self-organise the new status of the order {{in the presence of the}} uncertainties and update the relevant attributes before the order is released. Four types of intelligence were examined: (1) lead-time allowance, (2) capacity allowance, (3) safety stock allowance and (4) batching flexibility. Experiments results from each system were compared. It was found that the manufacturing system with intelligent feedback has a higher ability to achieve its <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> by proactively tackling the variations caused by uncertainties. This study also found that the reliability of a work order in the presence of uncertainty could be improved by using an appropriate type of intelligence. which is dependent upon how and when the order was released. It was concluded from this research that intelligent feedback could help manufacturing enterprises proactively readjust the release of work orders that will be affected by uncertainties in order to improve the reliability and delivery of work orders.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to explore the {{changing}} utility of radiotherapy {{in the treatment of}} patients with glioblastoma over the past 60 years. Together with surgery, radiotherapy has always been the cornerstone of treatment of glioblastoma, but techniques have significantly advanced over this time. The exploration of early two-dimensional techniques, investigation of dose escalation, concomitant chemotherapy and modern techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy, image-guided radiotherapy, and volumetric-modulated arc therapy will be covered. In addition, current controversies including decreasing margin size, re-irradiation, treatment of elderly patients, and novel imaging tracers will be discussed. Future directions including immunotherapy and tumour treating fields are examined. Radiotherapy-based treatments cannot rely solely on advances in chemotherapy or immunotherapy to improve the overall survival of patients with glioblastoma.

40|$|Peptide {{transporter}} 1 (PEPT 1), abundantly {{expressed in}} the small intestine, is a tempting <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> for increasing the oral absorption of drugs and prodrugs which might otherwise have poor absorption. This dissertation project proposes to delineate the quantitative importance of PEPT 1 in the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of the model PEPT 1 -targeted prodrug valacyclovir. In wildtype and Pept 1 knockout mice, the effective permeability of valacyclovir was evaluated {{as a function of}} perfusate pH, drug concentration, potential inhibitors and regional segments of the intestines using in situ perfusions. Results from the in situ studies showed that PEPT 1 accounted for approximately 90 % of valacyclovir permeability in mouse small intestine. Absorbed valacyclovir was completely converted to its active drug acyclovir in enterocytes. In wildtype mice, valacyclovir permeability was pH independent, concentration dependent, saturable with a Km of about 10 mM, and inhibited by known PEPT 1 substrates. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that PEPT 1 had little impact on the pharmacokinetic profiles of acyclovir following its oral or intravenous dosing whereas PEPT 1 deletion led to approximately 78 % and 58 % reductions in acyclovir maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), respectively, after oral valacyclovir. Lastly, a mechanistic ACAT model, in which the primary input parameters were obtained from previous in situ and in vivo studies, reasonably simulated the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetic profiles of valacyclovir after its oral administration in both genotypes. The duodenum (> 40 %) was the primary absorption site of valacyclovir in wildtype mice while the more distal jejunal (~ 13 %) and ileal (~ 10 %) segments played a more important role in valacyclovir absorption for Pept 1 knockout animals. Rapid luminal hydrolysis was the main cause of incomplete valacyclovir absorption in wildtype mice. In conclusion, results from this dissertation provided convincing evidence to validate the major contribution of PEPT 1 on the intestinal absorption of valacyclovir and, furthermore, the utilization of PEPT 1 as an oral <b>delivery</b> <b>target.</b> In silico mechanistic modeling aided in the interpretation of in situ and in vivo experimental results, and could be a useful tool in facilitating our understanding of valacyclovir’s complicated intestinal absorption processes...|$|E

Delivery of plasmid DNA encoding luciferase to recellularized dermal constructs was enhanced, resulting in a fourfold increase in luciferase expression over 120 hours compared to injection only (P < 0. 05). Delivery of plasmid DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was confirmed in the epidermal layers of the construct. In vivo experiments were performed in BALB/c mice, with skin as the <b>delivery</b> <b>target.</b> PAA exposure significantly enhanced luciferase expression levels 460 -fold in exposed sites compared to levels obtained from the injection of plasmid DNA alone (P < 0. 001). Expression levels were enhanced when the plasma reactor was positioned more distant from the injection site. Delivery of plasmid DNA encoding GFP to mouse skin was confirmed by immunostaining, where a 3 -minute exposure at a 10 [*]mm distance displayed delivery distribution deep within the dermal layers compared to an exposure at 3 [*]mm where GFP expression was localized within the epidermis.

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors are {{expressed}} {{on the surface}} of eukaryotic cells and internalise in response to ligand binding. The actions of the hormone and neurotransmitter neurotensin (NT) are predominantly mediated by specific interactions with one such receptor. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS 1), which is upregulated in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic and breast tumours. NTS 1 could therefore serve as a target for selective delivery of therapeutics. This study characterised the expression of NTS 1 in HEK 293 cells, as well as both polarised and non-polarised intestinal epithelial Caco- 2 cells. NT-conjugated fluorophores were internalised in NTS 1 -expressing HEK 293 and Caco- 2 cells in a receptor-mediated fashion. Confocal microscopy revealed fluorophore localisation in the perinuclear region. Cell uptake and transport across the Caco- 2 intestinal model of two NT-conjugated fluorophores (GFP and fluorescein) were compared to evaluate the effect of cargo size on cellular uptake. This work demonstrates that NT ligand conjugation is able to deliver relatively large macromolecular cargoes selectively into cells overexpressing NTS 1 and the system is able to effectively translocate macromolecules across an intestinal epithelial model. NTS 1 therefore shows potential as a drug <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> not only for targeted but also non-invasive (oral) delivery of biotherapeutics for cancer...|$|E

40|$|Background This study {{aimed to}} explore {{experiences}} of implementation of alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) in settings outside of primary healthcare in the Scottish national programme. The focus {{of the study was}} on strategies and learning to support ABI implementation in settings outside of primary healthcare in general, rather on issues specific to any single setting. Methods 14 semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with senior implementation leaders in antenatal, accident and emergency and wider settings and audio-recorded. Interviews were analysed inductively. Results The process of achieving large-scale, routine implementation of ABI proved challenging for all involved across the settings. Interviewees reported their experiences and identified five main strategies as helpful for strategic implementation efforts in any setting: (1) Having a high-profile target for the number of ABIs delivered in a specific time period with clarity about whose responsibility it was to implement the target; (2) Gaining support from senior staff from the start; (3) Adapting the intervention, using a pragmatic, collaborative approach, to fit with current practice; (4) Establishing practical and robust recording, monitoring and reporting systems for intervention delivery, prior to widespread implementation; and (5) Establishing close working relationships with frontline staff including flexible approaches to training and readily available support. Conclusions This qualitative study suggests that even with significant national support, funding and a specific <b>delivery</b> <b>target,</b> ABI implementation in new settings is not straightforward.

40|$|The {{oligopeptide}} transporter PEPT 1 {{is predominantly}} {{expressed in the}} brush-border membranes of small intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays pivotal roles in the efficient absorption of di-/tripeptides. PEPT 1 has enormous potential as an oral drug <b>delivery</b> <b>target,</b> because it also mediates the intestinal absorption of peptide-mimetic and nonpeptide substrates. We demonstrated that the peptide derivation of amino acid-related drugs is applicable to improve their intestinal absorption. We have found that oligopeptide transport activity is also expressed in cancer cell lines. The tissue distribution of bestatin was significantly increased in solid tumors that overexpress PEPT 1 in nude mice. Orally administered bestatin strongly suppressed tumor growth. These results provided the first demonstration of the tumor-selective delivery of a drug by specific transport activity. The absolute degree of PEPT 1 mRNA expression in the small intestine was determined using real-time PCR in rats. Starvation of the animals increased the mRNA expression level profoundly in the upper small intestine. The longitudinal expression pattern was well correlated with the intestinal transport of cefadroxil in rats. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding PEPT 1 cDNA. Heterologous expression of PEPT 1 in the liver was successfully achieved by simple intvavenous. administration of the vector, resulting in increased liver distribution of [3 H] carnosine. In situ perfusion of the brain with the vector doubled the brain distribution of cefadroxil. Heterologous expression of the drug transporter in vivo could be a useful approach for drug delivery. © 2003 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan...|$|E

40|$|Official {{discussion}} and negotiation on housing policy in South Africa was closed in 1994 with {{the launch of}} the new Housing White Paper. Contradictions in this policy between housing procedure and <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> have limited its relevance to the poorest sector in society. The paper shows how these tensions between product and process are an outcome of negotiated policy-making, in which the attempt was to combine the dominant position of the private sector for the commodi"cation of housing, with people-centred housing procedures advocated by the democratic movement. In the second term of ANC government, the housing ministry, aware of some of the limitations of its policy, stated its intention to review the housing policy. This has led to renewed discussion. The paper traces shifts and continuities in recent positions on housing in South Africa. It traces their emergence from within the democratic movement including labour and community or civic organisation, the more recent Homeless People's Federation/People's Dialogue alliance, and the private sector with its in#uential Urban Foundation and subsequent policy research institutes. The paper argues that shifts in housing "nance have largely ignored the needs of the poorest sector in society. Further, the inadequately integrated location of subsidised development for the poorest remains unchallenged. The perception of local government merely as implementer in a centralised programme limits the ability to address local realities, also imposing bureaucratic constraints on community-based construction. In addition, an evasive discourse on squatting does not lend itself to the formulation of mechanism of intervention oriented around the needs of the poor. These limitations in addressing poverty through housing policy should inform future research on shelter in South Africa. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccumulating {{evidence}} implicates the tumor-draining {{lymph node}} (TDLN) in tumor-induced immune escape, as it drains regulatory molecules and leukocytes from the tumor microenvironment. We asked whether targeted delivery of adjuvant to the TDLN, presumably already bathed in tumor antigens, could promote anti-tumor immunity and hinder tumor growth. To this end, we used 30  nm polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that effectively target dendritic cells (DCs, CD 11 c+) within the lymph node (LN) after intradermal administration. These NPs accumulated within the TDLN when administered in the limb ipsilateral (i. l.) to the tumor {{or in the}} non-TDLN when administered in the contralateral (c. l.) limb. Incorporating the adjuvants CpG or paclitaxel into the NPs (CpG-NP and PXL-NP) induced DC maturation in vitro. When administered daily i. l. and thus targeting the TDLN of a B 16 –F 10 melanoma, adjuvanted NPs induced DC maturation within the TDLN and reshaped the CD 4 + T cell distribution within the tumor towards a Th 1 (CXCR 3 +) phenotype. Importantly, this also led {{to an increase in}} the frequency of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells within the tumor. This correlated with slowed tumor growth, in contrast to unhindered tumor growth after c. l. delivery of adjuvanted NPs (targeting a non-TDLN) or i. l. delivery of free adjuvant. CpG-NP treatment in the i. l. limb also was associated with an increase in CD 8 +/CD 4 + T cell ratios and frequencies of activated (CD 25 +) CD 8 + T cells within the TDLN whereas PXL-NP treatment reduced the frequency of regulatory T (FoxP 3 + CD 4 +) cells in the TDLN. Together, these data implicate the TDLN as a <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> for adjuvant therapy of solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|Delivering {{homes and}} {{infrastructure}} through incentivisation: {{the role of}} the growth points agenda and the New Homes Bonus The formation of the Coalition Government has led to a dramatic change in the operation and promotion of governance, the management of public finance, and the delivery of homes and infrastructure across England. Accompanying reforms have also been made to the English planning system, with a raft of proposals having been introduced {{over the course of the}} last year. At the same time, the challenges remain the same, with the need to provide economic growth and increased housing supply high on the agenda. In looking to the future, the government has predictably looked to the past by undertaking a fast-paced review of the policies and commitments of the previous administration. Many programmes have subsequently been curtailed in response to current austerity measures, or where previous initiatives have failed to demonstrate their value. This paper will focus on two high-profile initiatives associated with the delivery of housing and infrastructure. Firstly, it will examine the Growth Points agenda that was introduced by the last government in 2006. This programme invited local authorities to compete for funds in order to contribute towards an annual <b>delivery</b> <b>target</b> of some 240, 000 homes a year. Secondly, the paper will focus on the recently introduced New Homes Bonus (NHB) that provides each local authority with additional funds as a reward for either building new homes, or for facilitating the re-use of empty homes. Although coverage has been given to the process through which revenues will be calculated and distributed across England, little has been said about how this current scheme compares with the previous Growth Points agenda or other similar initiatives. This is somewhat surprising given that both programmes share a common commitment to facilitate economic growth and infrastructure delivery, and to positively re-shaping attitudes towards local development. ...|$|E
