5000|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used to {{classify}} glass and other optical materials {{in terms of their}} chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion flint glasses have V < 55 whereas the lower dispersion crown glasses have larger Abbe numbers. Values of V range from below 25 for very <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> glasses, around 34 for polycarbonate plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses.|$|E
50|$|In {{magneto-optical}} shutters, {{the active}} material of the Faraday cell (e.g. <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> glass, which reacts well to strong magnetic field) is located inside an electromagnet coil, formed by few loops of thick wire. The coil is powered through a pulse forming network, by a discharge of a high-voltage capacitor (e.g. 2 microfarads at 1000 volts), switched into the coil by a trigatron or a thyratron.In electro-optical shutters, the active material is a liquid, typically nitrobenzene, {{located in a}} cell between two electrodes. A brief impulse of high voltage is applied to rotate the polarization of the passing light.|$|E
50|$|The Verdet {{constant}} {{for most}} materials is extremely small and is wavelength dependent. It is strongest in substances containing paramagnetic ions such as terbium. The highest Verdet constants in bulk media {{are found in}} terbium doped <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> glasses or in crystals of terbium gallium garnet (TGG). These materials have excellent transparency properties and high damage thresholds for laser radiation. Atomic vapours, however, can have Verdet constants which are orders of magnitude larger than TGG, but only over a very narrow wavelength range. Alkali vapours can therefore {{be used as an}} optical isolator (in essence, a diode for light), as demonstrated in Durham University's Atomic and Molecular Physics research group.|$|E
50|$|TGG {{has a high}} Verdet {{constant}} {{which results}} in the Faraday effect. The Verdet constant increases substantially as the mineral approaches cryogenic temperatures. The highest Verdet constants are found in terbium doped <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> glasses or in crystals of TGG. The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength) and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632 nm, the Verdet constant for TGG {{is reported to be}} -134 rad/T·m, whereas at 1064 nm it falls to -40 rad/T·m. This behavior means that the devices manufactured with a certain degree of rotation at one wavelength, will produce much less rotation at longer wavelengths. Many Faraday rotators and isolators are adjustable by varying {{the degree to which the}} amount of the Faraday rotator material is inserted into the magnetic field of the device. In this way, the device can be tuned for use with a range of lasers within the design range of the device.|$|E
40|$|A major {{debate in}} {{prehistory}} {{revolves around the}} time and place of the earliest habitual use of fire and the hominin species responsible for it. Here we present a newly discovered hearth at Qesem Cave (Israel) that was repeatedly used and was the focus of hearth-centered human activities, as early as three-hundred-thousand years ago. The hearth, identified based on mineralogical and microscopic criteria, contains two superimposed use cycles, each composed of shorter - episodes possibly the earliest superimposed hearth securely identified to date. The hearth covers ca. 4 m(2) in area making it a uniquely large hearth in comparison to any contemporaneous hearth identified thus far, possibly indicating it has been used by a relatively large group of people. In addition, the hearth is located {{in the center of the}} cave and is associated with butchered animal remains and a <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> assemblage. The flint assemblage indicates spatially differentiated meat cutting and hide working activity areas. The central location of the hearth within the cave and the activities associated with it may reflect an embedded perception of space organization of the Qesem Cave inhabitants. Since fire was habitually used throughout the 420 - 200 ky sequence of Qesem Cave, where preservation conditions are alike throughout, we suggest that this unique hearth may reflect a development in nature and most probably in the intensity of fire use in Qesem Cave, from ca. 300 ka ago onwards.

40|$|Nonlinear {{refractive}} index changes in isotropic media are {{a consequence of}} two distinct types of mechanisms. An "electronic" mechanism arises from the nonlinear distortion of the electron orbits about the nuclei and a "nuclear" mechanism arises from an electric-field-induced change in the motions of nuclei. A general treatment of nonlinear optical phenomena involving a polarization cubic in the electric field strength is given with the topic of nonlinear index changes treated as a special case. A central result of this theory is the following expression for the nonlinear polarization P 3 (t) {{in terms of the}} electric field E (t), the "electronic" parameter σ and the "nuclear response functions" a(t) and b(t) : P 3 (t) = σ- 2 E (t) ▪ E (t) E (t) + ∫ a(t-τ) E (τ) ▪ E (τ) dτ E (t) + ∫ b(t-τ) E (τ) ▪ E (t) E (τ) dτ In the theory the relationship between these parameters and the nonlinear susceptibility tensor X 3, is established. Several experiments in nonlinear optics are analyzed; in particular, it is shown that Kerr effect measurements lead to a determination of the quantity σ + β (where β = ʃ b(t) dt) whereas measurements of the intensity dependent rotation of the polarization ellipse of a monochromatic optical beam yield the quantity σ + 2 β. Hence together these two techniques offer a means of uniquely determining both the "electronic" parameter a and the "nuclear" parameter β in any isotropic medium. The nonlinear susceptibility element X 3 1221 (-ω,ω,ω,-ω) = σ+ 2 β/ 24 is calculated from ellipse rotation measurements in fused quartz, BK- 7 borosilicate crown glass, and SF- 7 <b>dense</b> <b>flint</b> glass giving values of 1. 5, 2. 3, and 9. 9 x 10 - 15 esu at λ = 6943 Å, respectively. These measurements constitute the first observations of ellipse rotation in any solid and (with an absolute accuracy of 11...|$|E
