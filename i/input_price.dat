40|$|The {{empirical}} trade {{literature has}} traditionally studied exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) into imported consumer goods prices but not into imported <b>input</b> <b>prices.</b> It also implicitly assumed full ERPT into imported <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> in studying {{their role in}} exchange rate adjustments of exports, which is a rather strong assumption.

[...] So, for the standard MACD filter time constants of 12 and 26 days, the MACD derivative estimate is filtered approximately by the equivalent of a low-pass EMA filter of 38 days.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a simple}} repeated game model to analyze how industry outcomes alter if a regulated input monopolist {{is allowed to}} integrate into the downstream retail market. Integration helps overcome double marginalization-a feature {{well known in the}} existing literature.

If the regulated <b>input</b> <b>price</b> exceeds marginal cost, an integrated monopolist has an incentive to increase retail sales as this raises upstream profits. It will be less willing to engage in any tacitly collusive conduct in the downstream market and it has a greater incentive to cheat on any collusive arrangement.

A social planner may prefer the upstream monopoly to participate in the downstream market, even if integration leads to a higher regulated <b>input</b> <b>price.</b> The anti-competitive effects of the higher <b>input</b> <b>price</b> are more than offset by the pro-competitive effects of integration.

40|$|Mandatory network {{unbundling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important topics in regulatory economics today. The concept has crucial importance in the deregulation of many previously regulated industries including electricity, telecommunications, gas and railroads. Upon initial examination, determining the correct <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> would seem important for sending the correct price signals to the entrants for their efficient make-or-buy decisions. However, Sappington uses a standard Hotelling location model to show that <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> are irrelevant for an entrant’s make or buy decision. In this study, it is shown that this result is closely related to the degree of product differentiation when firms are engaged in price competition. Specifically, it is shown that <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> are irrelevant when firms produce homogeneous products, but are relevant for make-or-buy decisions when the entrant and incumbent produce differentiated products. These results suggest that, in general, it is important for regulators to set correct prices in order to not distort the entrants’ efficient make-or-buy decisions...|$|R

40|$|In a {{large number}} of energy models, the use of {{learning}} curves for estimating technological improvements has become popular. This {{is based on the assumption}} that technological development can be monitored by following cost development as a function of market size. However, recent data show that in some stages of photovoltaic technology (PV) production, the market price of PV modules stabilizes even though the cumulative capacity increases. This implies that no technological improvement takes place in these periods: the cost predicted by the learning curve in the PV study is lower than the market one. We propose that this bias results from ignoring the effects of <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> and scale effects, and that incorporating the <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> and scale effects into the learning curve theory is an important issue in making cost predictions more reliable. In this paper, a methodology is described to incorporate the scale and input-prices effect as the additional variables into the one factor learning curve, which leads to the definition of the multi-factor learning curve. This multi-factor learning curve is not only derived from economic theories, but also supported by an empirical study. The results clearly show that <b>input</b> <b>prices</b> and scale effects are to be included, and that, although market prices are stabilizing, learning is still taking place.
