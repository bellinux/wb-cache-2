40|$|The {{proposed}} self-adaptive predictive pursuing policy {{consists of}} an action <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> and a procedure of adjusting the estimation of evader’s action preference. Since correct estimation of opponent’s intention would do good to win adversarial games, it introduces the conception of action preference to model opponent’s decision-making. Because evader often has different action preference in different situation, to model evader’s decision-making, pursuer has to divide the situation space into many categories and provide a set of estimation of evader’s action preference for each kind of situation. Pursuer adjusts the estimation of evader’s action preference in certain situation by observing evader’s action. Action <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of situation sorting, possible future states computation, payoff evaluation and action selection. Action decision-making {{is based on the}} decision tree constructed by expected payoffs. Expected payoffs are integrated from single payoffs.

40|$|According to the neo-corporatist {{approach}} to the “problem of compliance,” worker control over union policy is incompatible with centralized wage regulation, because only associations in which national leaders are insulated from their members are capable of delivering rank-and-file acceptance of wage moderation. This analysis of centralized collective bargaining agreements in Italy in the 1980 s and 1990 s provides a critical re-examination of the traditional neo-corporatist approach. The author, drawing on archival research and interviews, argues that centralization can be entirely compatible with <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> in which rank-and-file workers have ultimate decision-making power. In fact, the Italian labor movement's adoption of more “democratic” <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> he claims, was instrumental in generating and sustaining centralized collective bargaining arrangements in Italy in the early 1990 s...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} investigated {{the relation between}} autonomy (i. e., freedom of choice) and procedural justice. Three studies tested the hypothesis that people would be particularly sensitive to the fairness of <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> when they experience deprivation of autonomy needs. Study 1 indicated that procedural justice judgments indeed were influenced more strongly by variations in <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> among participants who experienced little autonomy in their life. In Study 2, these findings were conceptually replicated by manipulating whether participants were provided with choice {{on an issue that}} was unrelated to the outcomes of the subsequent decision-making process. Study 3 revealed evidence for the hypothesis in a field setting. It is concluded that procedural justice is functional to regulate basic autonomy needs. © 2009 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Portable energy {{dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence (pEDXRF) spectrometry analysis {{was applied for}} the characterisation of archaeological ceramic findings from three Neolithic sites in Serbia. Two dimension reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and scattering matrices-based dimension reduction were {{used to examine the}} possible classification of those findings, and to extract the most discriminant features. Results A <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed, whose goal is to classify unknown ceramic findings based on their elemental compositions derived by pEDXRF spectrometry. As a major part of <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure,</b> the possibilities of two dimension reduction methods were tested. Scattering matrices-based dimension reduction was found to be the more efficient method for the purpose. Linear classifiers designed based on the desired output allowed for 7 of 8 unknown samples from the test set to be correctly classified. Conclusions Based on the results, the conclusion is that despite the constraints typical of the applied analytical technique, the elemental composition can be considered as viable information in provenience studies. With a fully-developed procedure, ceramic artefacts can be classified based on their elemental composition and well-known provenance. </p...|$|E
