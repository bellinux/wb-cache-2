40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infections are}} a serious health problem {{affecting}} {{millions of people}} each year. They are {{the second most common}} type of infection in the body. The objective of {{study was to determine the}} etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of urinary tract infections pathogens isolated in our Patology Clinic laboratory. Materials and Methods: During the period July 2007 - July 2008,were analysed 1422 urine samples. The determination of the total microbe load were acquire with an kit of the BIO-DETECTOR while the identification of germs with Apy sistem. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were assaied with the ATB UR strip. Results: About the total of samples analysed, 320 (22 %) had significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli was the most common etiologic agent isolated (62 %), followed by <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>ssp.</b> (10 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5, 95 %) and Proteus mirabilis (5 %). Gram-positive bacteria accounted for only 7. 32 %, with prevalence of Staphylococcus ssp (5, 32) and Enterococcus spp (2 %). The most effective antibiotics for Gram- were: Imipenem, Amikacin, Ceftazidime and Cefotaxim, while for Gram+ were: Minocyclin,Vancomycin and Oxacillin. Conclusion: Escherichia coli was the microrganism more frequently isolated between Gram negative bacteria with very susceptible to Amoxicillin. Currently, the empirical use of Cotrimoxazole and Amoxicillin is not recommended for Enterobacteriaceae. Urinary tract infections are more common in women than in men. Men are more likely to get a UTI once past the age of 65. Current data on the prevalence of multidrug resistance among urinary tract isolates should be a consideration to change the current empiric treatment of IVU...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread and}} {{evolution}} of Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) production in clinically significant gram-negative bacteria {{has been a problem}} since the mid- 1980 s. Due to the diversity of ESBLs, antibiotic susceptibility testing of beta-lactams with isolates producing these enzymes is often unreliable. The methods for rapid detection and identification of ESBL-producing strains have been somewhat restricted. A newly developed ESBL test in the Phoenix ™ Automated Microbiology System, currently under development at BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD, was evaluated for the detection of ESBL production in clinically important gram negative bacilli. Genetically or phenotypically characterized ESBL strains along with wild type and strains with other known resistance mechanisms such as original spectrum beta-lactamase, or aminoglycoside modifying enzymes were included in the test panel. A total of 88 strains, including Escherichia coli (52), <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp</b> pneumoniae (30), <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp</b> ozaenae (1), <b>Klebsiella</b> oxytoca (4) and Klebsiella species (1) were tested using Phoenix ™ AST panels containing the ESBL test. The NCCLS recommended ESBL tests with standard broth microdilution (SBM) containing aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime/clavulanic acid, and cefotaxime / clavulanic acid were tested in parallel with the Phoenix ™ system. Of the total 52 strains tested positive by the SBM method, Phoenix ™ correctly identified 49 strains (94 %). The average time to result was 7. 5 h (range = 5 to 11 h) in the Phoenix ™ System. Overall, the performance of Phoenix ™ ESBL test showed a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 % (36 / 36) in this study. These results indicate that the Phoenix ™ ESBL test can provide laboratorians and clinicians with a reliable and rapid means for the detection of ESBL production in clinically important gram negative bacteria...|$|R

The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize microorganisms that produce lipases, from different food industry effluents localized in Pelotas, RS/Brazil. Bacteria were identified using Gram stain and biochemical tests (Vitek 2 (r)). Fungi were identified according to macro and micromorphology characteristics. The extracellular lipase production was evaluated using the Rhodamine B test and the enzymatic activity by titration. Twenty-one bacteria were isolated and identified as <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp.</b> pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Raoultella ornithinolytica and Raoultella planticola. Were characterized isolated filamentous fungi by the following genera: Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp., Geotrichum sp., Gliocladium sp., Mucor sp., Paecilomyces sp. and Trichoderma sp.

40|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} from the crop and midgut of field collected Bactrocera cacuminata (Hering) and Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Two methods were used, firstly isolation onto two types of bacteriological culture media (PYEA and TSA) and identification using the API- 20 E diagnostic kit, and secondly, analysis of samples using the 16 S rRNA gene molecular diagnostic method. Using the API- 20 E method, 10 genera and 17 species of bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae were identified from cultures growing on the nutrient agar. The dominant species in both the crop and midgut were Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Providencia rettgeri, <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp</b> ozaenae and Serratia marcescens {{were isolated}} from B. tryoni only.

As there is a paucity of data on the current burden of P. falciparum, S. mansoni and soil transmitted helminths (STH) infections and their correlation with schoolchildren's anemia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we collect these data. This study reports baseline data collected from a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of IPT with SP and SP-PQ on anemia and malaria morbidity in Congolese schoolchildren (Trial registration: NCT 01722539; PACTR 201211000449323). S. mansoni and STH infections were assessed using kato-katz technique. Malaria infection and hemoglobin concentration were assessed using Blood smear and Hemocontrol device, respectively. A total of 616 primary schoolchildren from 4 to 13 years old {{were enrolled in the}} study. The prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection was 18. 5 % (95 %CI: 15. 6 - 21. 9). Amongst those infected, 24 (21 %), 40 (35. 1 %), 40 (35. 1 %), 10 (8. 8 %), had light, moderate, heavy, very high malaria parasite density, respectively. Above 9 years of age (p = 0. 02), male and history of fever (p = 0. 04) were both associated with malaria infection. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 6. 4 % (95 %CI: 4. 4 - 9. 1).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae is an {{uncommon}} human pathogen with serious infections reported in immunocompromised hosts. In Europe, {{only a few}} cases have been described. Patients with this infection usually {{have a history of}} contact with reptiles or travel abroad. We present a case report of infection in a patient with hypoglobulinemia and a literature review. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 43 -year-old Caucasian Italian man with hypoglobulinemia who presented to our hospital with sepsis and diarrhea. A stool culture yielded S. enterica ssp. arizonae. Our patient was treated with oral ciprofloxacin and made a full recovery. We also present a review of the cases of S. enterica <b>ssp.</b> arizonae <b>infections</b> previously reported in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of infections from S. enterica ssp. arizonae occur in patients who are immunocompromised. Data from the literature suggests that {{it may be difficult to}} eradicate the bacteria and thus, prolonged antibiotic courses are often used. It would be advisable for clinicians to investigate for pre-existing immune dysfunction if S. enterica ssp. arizonae is isolated.

40|$|Endemic {{diseases}} can {{be counted}} among the most serious sources of losses for livestock production. In dairy farms in particular, {{one of the most}} common diseases is Johne's disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium <b>ssp.</b> paratuberculosis (MAP). <b>Infection</b> with MAP causes direct costs because it affects milk production, but it has also been suspected to increase the risk of clinical mastitis (CM) among infected animals. This might contribute to further costs for farmers. We asked whether MAP infection represents a risk factor for CM and, in particular, whether CM occurrences were more common in MAP-infected animals. Our results, obtained by survival analysis, suggest that MAP-infected cows had an increased probability of experiencing CM during lactation. These results highlight the need to account for the interplay of infectious diseases and other health conditions in economic and epidemiological modeling. In this case, accounting for MAP-infected cows having an increased CM occurrence might have nonnegligible effects on the estimated benefit of MAP control...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic variability ofMycobacterium avium <b>ssp.</b> paratuberculo-sis <b>infection</b> in US Holsteins. Blood and fecal samples were collected primarily from daughters of 12 bulls in their second or third lactation. Routine disease testing of the sires documented that they were not infected. Herds without a “suspect ” or positive ELISA (sample/ positive ratio ≥ 0. 10) or positive fecal culture test were deleted from the data set. The remaining 4, 603 cows from 238 herds and 46 sires were used to estimate heritability of M. paratuberculosis infection. Heritabil-ity was estimated with 3 Johne’s disease diagnostic tests: 1) fecal culture alone, 2) serum antibody ELISA alone, and 3) both tests (combined) with a positive ani-mal defined as all animals with either a positive fecal culture or ELISA test. Four statistical models were used to estimate heritability: 1) linear (ELISA), 2) threshold (fecal culture and combined), 3) ordered threshold (ELISA), and 4) bivariate linear-threshold (ELISA-fecal culture). A sire model and Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used in each case. Heritability of infection based on the fecal culture test was 0. 153 [posterior standard deviation (PSD) = 0. 115]. Heritability with the ELISA was 0. 159 (PSD = 0. 090) with a linear model and 0. 091 (PSD = 0. 053) with an ordered threshold model. Heritability of the combined tests was 0. 102 (PSD = 0. 066). Heritability estimates of fecal culture and ELISA with the bivariate model varied slightly from estimates obtained with the univariate models (0. 125 and 0. 183, respectively), with a corresponding increase in precision (PSD = 0. 096 and 0. 082, respectively).

Disease status, as indicated by MAP test results, was determined through quarterly ELISA serum testing, biannual fecal culture, and culture of tissues and feces at slaughter. Milk production data were collected from the Dairy Herd Information Association. Animals with positive MAP test results were categorized, based on test results over the full course of the study, as high path (at least one high-positive culture) or low path (at least one positive culture or ELISA). The cumulative numbers of positive ELISA and culture results were recorded. The effects of both MAP infection path, status, and number of positive tests on milk production were analyzed using a mixed linear model with an autocorrelation random effect structure. Low- and high-path animals produced more milk before their first positive test than always-negative animals, especially high-path animals. Although mean production decreased after a first positive test, low-path animals were shown to recover some productivity. High-path animals continued to exhibit a decrease in milk production, especially after their first high-positive fecal culture. These results show that not all animals that test positive for MAP will have long-term production losses. Milk production decreased significantly with each additional positive test. Ultimately, production loss appeared to be a function of MAP infection progression...|$|R

Potato losses and quality degradation due to the effect of storage variables or processing conditions must be reduced to increase the world food supply. To accomplish these objectives, studies have been conducted to evaluate: (a) quality changes in potatoes during cooking and frying, (b) quality changes in raw potatoes as influenced by storage conditions, (c) changes in cooking quality of potatoes as influence by storage conditions, (d) changes in frying quality of potatoes as influenced by storage conditions, and finally (e) quality changes in potatoes as influenced by Erwinia carotovora <b>ssp.</b> carotovora <b>infection</b> (Ecc, casual agent of soft rot disease in potato). Kinetics of quality changes during cooking and frying of potatoes were evaluated. Potatoes were cooked at 80 [...] 100 °C or fried at 160 [...] 190 °C for selected times and their texture and color were evaluated. Results showed that texture values of cooked potatoes decreased with the progress of cooking, and the rate of texture changes at each temperature was found to be consistent with two pseudo first-order kinetic mechanisms. Textural values of fried potatoes increased with frying time and followed a first order kinetic model. Cooked potatoes were less bright, more red and less yellow in color as compared to raw samples. A modified first order model was used to characterize the color changes kinetics of both cooked and fried potatoes based on the changes occurring between the initial and a maximum or minimum value. 10 min cooking at 100 °C and 10 min frying at 180 °C were considered to give the designed cooked and fried products, respectively. The changes in quality characteristics of potatoes as a function of storage variables (temperature and time) were evaluated. Potatoes were stored at five temperatures (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 °C) for selected duration (at least 5 time intervals) and different physico-chemical quality parameters were evaluated. Potatoes remained healthier when they stored at lower temperatures due to absence of sprouts and visible spoilage. They became softer and darker by passage of time...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrates are {{constantly}} exposed to pathogens, and the adaptive immunity has most likely evolved {{to control and}} clear such infectious agents. CD 4 T cells are the {{major players in the}} adaptive immune response to pathogens. Following recognition of pathogen-derived antigens na&# 239;ve CD 4 T cells differentiate into effectors which then control pathogen replication either directly by killing pathogen-infected cells or by assisting with generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes or pathogen-specific antibodies. Pathogen-specific effector CD 4 T cells are highly heterogeneous in terms of cytokines they produce. Three major subtypes of effector CD 4 T cells have been identified: T-helper 1 (Th 1) cells producing IFN-g and TNF-α, Th 2 cells producing IL- 4 and IL- 10, and Th 17 cells producing IL- 17. How this heterogeneity is maintained and what regulates changes in effector T cell composition during chronic infections remains poorly understood. In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of CD 4 T cell differentiation in response to microbial infections. We propose that a change in the phenotype of pathogen-specific effector CD 4 T cells during chronic infections, for example, from Th 1 to Th 2 response as observed in Mycobacteriumavium <b>ssp.</b> paratuberculosis (MAP) <b>infection</b> of ruminants, can be achieved by conversion of T cells from one effector subset to another (cellular plasticity) or due to differences in kinetics (differentiation, proliferation, death) of different effector T cell subsets (population plasticity).

Keine der Proben wies gemäß VO (EG) Nr. 2073 / 2005 und den Empfehlungen der Kommission 2004 / 24 /EC und 2005 / 175 /EC Mängel hinsichtlich der mikrobiologischen Qualität auf. Der {{qualitative}} Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae in Anlehnung an die ISO-Norm 21528 - 1 ergab für 55 Proben (44 %) einen positiven Befund. Die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen in Anlehnung an die Methoden L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 der ASUV nach § 64 LFGB ergab für 41 Proben (33 %) einen positiven Befund. Die Mehrzahl der positiven Proben (88 %) wies einen niedrigen Keimgehalt auf (< 102 KbE/g), der maximale Keimgehalt lag bei 3, 4 x 104 KbE/g. Eine Kontamination mit Enterobacteriaceae bzw. coliformen Keimen wurde häufiger bei unverpackt angebotenen Proben festgestellt (70 % bzw. 56 % positiv), die in der Mehrzahl der Fälle im Einzelhandel oder auf dem Wochenmarkt erworben worden waren. Frischkäse mit Zutaten (Paprika, Tomate, Gewürze) waren häufiger positiv für Enterobacteriaceae bzw. coliforme Keime. Die am häufigsten nachgewiesenen Enterobacteriaceae-Spezies waren Enterobacter cloacae (30 % der Proben), <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp.</b> pneumoniae (19 %), Escherichia coli (14 %), Serratia liquefaciens, Pantoea agglomerans (beide 13 %) und Klebsiella oxytoca (10 %). E. coli wurde in 17 Proben (14 %) nachgewiesen, der maximale Keimgehalt lag bei 9, 5 x 101 KbE/g. Eine Überprüfung von 48 E. coli-Isolaten aus diesen Proben auf das Vorkommen der Gene stx 1 und stx 2 ergab keinen Hinweis auf Verotoxin-bildende E. coli. Listeria monocytogenes war in keiner Probe nachweisbar. Lediglich in drei Proben (2, 4 %) wurde L. innocua nachgewiesen. Koagulase-positive Staphylokokken wurden in einer Probe (1, 4 %) nachgewiesen (4, 0 x 101 KbE/g). Für fünf Frischkäsezubereitungen wurde die Veränderung des Gehaltes an Enterobacteriaceae während der Lagerung über 7 Tage bei + 6 °C geprüft. Bei allen Proben wurde eine Reduktion des Keimgehaltes um ein bis zwei Zehnerpotenzen festgestellt. Für den qualitativen Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae wurde in Anlehnung an die ISO-Norm 21528 - 1 gemäß VO (EG) Nr. 2073 / 2005 der VRBG-Agar verwendet. Ein Vergleich mit einem neueren Selektivnährmedium (ECC-Agar) zeigte, dass der ECC-Agar bezüglich der Nachweisbarkeit gleichwertig war und zudem auch noch eine eindeutigere Identifizierung von E. coli ermöglichte. Für die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen bzw. E. coli wurden in Anlehnung an die Methoden L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 der ASUV nach § 64 LFGB die LST-MUG-Bouillon und der VRB-MUG-Agar verwendet. Zusätzlich wurde der ECC-Agar eingesetzt. Es wurde gezeigt, dass der ECC-Agar sich als alternatives Selektivnährmedium für Nachweis von coliformen Keimen eignet. Die Verwendung der LST-MUG-Bouillon ergab für 41 Proben (33 %), der ECC-Agar für 34 Proben (27 %) und der VRB-MUG-Agar für 28 Proben (22 %) einen positiven Befund. Im Bezug auf die Nachweishäufigkeit der verschiedenen Coliformen-Spezies unterschieden sich die geprüften Medien meist nicht wesentlich. Deutliche Unterschiede wurden jedoch für den Nachweis von E. coli festgestellt. Für den qualitativen Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae wurde eine Voranreicherung (nicht-selektiv und selektiv) durchgeführt, für die quantitative Bestimmung von coliformen Keimen wurden die Nährmedien direkt beimpft. Nach Durchführung einer Voranreicherung waren 55 Proben positiv für Enterobacteriaceae, nach Direktbeimpfung nur 41 Proben. Das Spektrum der nachgewiesenen Enterobacteriaceae-Spezies war weitestgehend ähnlich, die Nachweisrate einzelner Spezies unterschied sich jedoch. Für den Anteil der E. coli-positiven Proben nach Direktbeimpfung (sieben Proben) und nach Voranreicherung (17 Proben) wurde ein signifikanter Unterschied festgestellt (p < 0, 05). Generell war die mikrobiologische Qualität der untersuchten Frischkäse als zufriedenstellend zu beurteilen. Sowohl der Nachweis von coliformen Keimen als auch der Nachweis von Enterobacteriaceae eignet sich als Parameter zur Beurteilung der mikrobiologischen Qualität, auch wenn die derzeit gültige EU-Verordnung diese Parameter für Frischkäse nicht vorsieht. In this study, a {{total of}} 125 curd (fresh) cheese samples from retail shops in Hesse, Germany (all made from pasteurized milk) were examined during 2007, to study their microbiological quality. According to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 and Commission Recommendations 2004 / 24 /EC and 2005 / 175 /EC none of these products was of unsatisfactory quality. The detection of Enterobacteriaceae according to ISO 21528 - 1 gave a positive results for 55 of the fresh cheese samples (44 %). The enumeration of coliform bacteria, performed according to methods L 01. 00 - 54 und L 01. 00 - 3 of the German collection of analytical methods for food (ASUV) in accordance to article 64 of the German food and feed law (LFGB) gave positive results for 41 of the samples (33 %). However, the number of colony forming units (cfu) of these bacteria was very low (< 102 cfu/g) {{in most of the}} positive samples (88 %), the maximum number was 3. 4 x 104 cfu/g. Contamination with Enterobacteriaceae and coliform bacteria was more frequent in cheese samples obtained as open slices from retail shop counters or from farmers markets (70 % and 56 % positive, respectively). Furthermore, curd cheese with ingredients (paprika, tomato, spices) was more frequently contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae or coliform bacteria than curd cheese without other ingredients. The most abundant Enterobacteriaceae species were Enterobacter cloacae (30 % of the samples), <b>Klebsiella</b> pneumoniae <b>ssp.</b> pneumoniae (19 %), Escherichia coli (14 %), Serratia liquefaciens, Pantoea agglomerans (both 13 %), and Klebsiella oxytoca (10 %). E. coli was identified in 17 samples (14 %), the maximum value was 9. 5 x 101 cfu/g. The examination of 48 E. coli-isolates of these samples for the occurrence of stx 1 and stx 2 did show no indication for Verotoxin-building E. coli. Listeria monocytogenes was not detected in any sample. Only three samples (2. 4 %) were positive for L. innocua. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in one (1. 4 %) sample (4. 0 x 101 cfu/g). Five fresh cheese varieties were examined for the alteration of the Enterobacteriaceae-concentration during storage for 7 days at + 6 °C. A reduction of the bacterial count about 1 log cfu/g to 2 log cfu/g was observed in all samples. VRBG agar was used for the detection of Enterobacteriaceae according to ISO 21528 - 1 consistent with 2005 / 2073 /EC. A comparison with a newer selective medium (ECC agar) showed that the ECC agar gave comparable results with regard to the detectability, and allowed identification of E. coli. LST MUG broth and VRB MUG agar were used for the detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria and E. coli according to ASUV methods L 01. 00 - 54 and L 01. 00 - 3. Additionally, the ECC agar was used. The ECC agar was found to be a suitable alternative selective medium for the detection of coliform bacteria. The LST MUG broth gave a positive result for 41 samples (33 %), the ECC agar for 34 samples (27 %), and the VRB-MUG agar for 28 samples (22 %). With regard to the detection rate of different coliform species, the tested media were equivalent in most cases, but considerable differences were observed for the detection of E. coli. For the qualitative detection of Enterobacteriaceae, pre-enrichment using non-selective and selective media was performed, while for the enumeration of coliform bacteria the media were directly inoculated. After pre-enrichment, 55 samples were positive for Enterobacteriaceae, after direct inoculation only 41 samples were positive. The range of detected Enterobacteriaceae species was similar, but the detection rate of some species was different. In particular for the number of E. coli-positive samples, a significant difference (p < 0. 05) was observed between positive results after direct inoculation (n = 7) and pre-enrichment (n = 17). Generally the microbiological quality of the examined fresh cheeses was satisfactory. The detection of coliform bacteria, as well as the detection of Enterobacteriaceae are both suitable parameters to estimate the microbiological quality of curd cheese, even though the current EU regulations do not demand these parameters to be implemented as a process hygiene criterion for curd cheese...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurveillance {{programs}} for animal diseases {{are critical to}} early disease detection and risk estimation and to documenting a population’s disease status at a given time. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe a risk-based surveillance program for detecting Mycobacterium avium <b>ssp.</b> paratuberculosis (MAP) <b>infection</b> in Norwegian dairy cattle. The included risk factors for detecting MAP were purchase of cattle, combined cattle and goat farming, and location of the cattle farm in counties containing goats with MAP. The risk indicators included production data [culling of animals > 3 yr of age, carcass conformation of animals > 3 yr of age, milk production decrease in older lactating cows (lactations 3, 4, and 5) ], and clinical data (diarrhea, enteritis, or both, in animals > 3 yr of age). Except for combined cattle and goat farming and cattle farm location, all data were collected at the cow level and summarized at the herd level. Predefined risk factors and risk indicators were extracted from different national databases and combined in a multivariate statistical process control to obtain a risk assessment for each herd. The ordinary Hotelling’s T 2 statistic was applied as a multivariate, standardized measure of difference between the current observed state and the average state of the risk factors for a given herd. To make the analysis more robust and adapt it to the slowly developing nature of MAP, monthly risk calculations were based on data accumulated during a 24 -mo period. Monitoring of these variables was performed to identify outliers that may indicate deviance in one or more of the underlying processes. The highest-ranked herds were scattered all over Norway and clustered in high-density dairy cattle farm areas. The resulting rankings of herds are being used in the national surveillance program for MAP in 2014 to increase the sensitivity of the ongoing surveillance program in which 5 fecal samples for bacteriological examination are collected from 25 dairy herds. The use of multivariate statistical process control for selection of herds will be beneficial when a diagnostic test suitable for mass screening is available and validated on the Norwegian cattle population, thus making it possible to increase the number of sampled herds...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of postoperative pain {{is affected by}} many factors including the patient’s age, sex, personality, knowledge of and confidence in the procedure, attitude of the staff, and the individual's physiological condition. The same procedure can produce different degrees of postoperative pain in different patients. Even though, in most cases, upper abdominal or thoracic surgery causes severe postoperative pain, superficial operations still cause mild postoperative pain. Patients usually feel the most pain {{in the first few}} hours after surgery. Postoperative pain can result in irritability, insomnia, increased heart rate, hypertension, excessive perspiration, overactive metabolism, tachycardia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, pallor and increased myocardial oxygen consumption. In patients with coronary artery disease, postoperative pain can result in myocardial ischemia and possible infarction that in turn may delay postoperative recovery. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an accepted method to relieve postoperative pain. Opioids are often used as an analgesic for severe pain management. Possible adverse effects are respiratory depression, constipation, vomiting, gastroparesis, and central nervous system depression including somnolence and consciousness disturbance. Opioid-related side effects often occur post-operatively, and are related to the total dosage of opioid medication. Non-pharmaceutical products can be an alternative in the treatment of post-operative pain and produce less adverse effects. Acupuncture’s ability to control pain has been documented for thousands of years and has become well-accepted in modern Western medicine. Electro-stimulation has a postoperative pain relieving effect when applied as either electro-acupuncture (EA), transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) or Silver Spike Point (SSP) therapy. SSP as needle-free EA and has been shown to have a similar analgesic effect to standard EA, where electrical stimulation is applied to needles that have been inserted into acupuncture points, and a superior effect than TENS. The acupuncture analgesic mechanism remains unclear in spite of successful clinical applications and recognition by WHO. This study investigated SSP needle-free EA's role in managing of postoperative pain and in reducing the adverse side effects of opioids. Acupuncture has generated much interest in western countries like Australia, and is considered a rather safe clinical treatment method {{for a wide range of}} disorders. However, in clinical applications, there are some contraindications and complications with using needles. SSP needle-free EA offers many benefits over standard acupuncture treatment such as: reduced hazardous waste, no skin penetration and therefore a reduced risk of <b>infection.</b> <b>SSP</b> EA provides a range of stimulation types that are particularly suitable for sensitive patients including young children and the elderly. A particular advantage of SSP EA is that it can be safely used on acupuncture points all over the body, whereas incorrect acupuncture needling over major organs and the spinal cord can cause serious problems. In this study, we examined the effects of Silver Spike Point (SSP) therapy, also known as needle-free electro-acupuncture (EA), at the classical bilateral acupuncture point Zusanli (ST 36) on postoperative pain and opioid-related side effects following hysterectomy. Based on a double blind, sham and different intervention controlled clinical experimental design, four groups of randomised patients were enrolled into the study as subjects. Group 1 was assigned as the control group; Subjects in group 2 were applied SSP electrode at a sham acupuncture point; Group 3 received SSP stimulation at 100 Hz and Group 4 received SSP stimulation by a mixture of at 3 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz on Zusanli (ST 36). It was planned that each group was to consist of 25 women who had undergone hysterectomy. The research evaluated the analgesic effect of SSP needle-free EA for post-operative pain relief of women who had been given a hysterectomy, and comparing the difference between high frequency and low frequency stimulation. The hypothesis was that the groups that received the double treatment of SSP needle-free EA (both pre- and post-surgery) at acupuncture point Zusanli (ST 36) would demonstrate increased analgesic relief over a longer period of time, i. e. longer duration before requiring the first PCA dose, fewer PCA doses required, and fewer opioid related side effects compared to the sham and control groups. In addition, the group that received the low frequency treatment would achieve better analgesic relief compared to the high frequency treatment, the sham, and the control groups. The Results were analyzed using a One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) doses delivered, and PCA doses demanded by the patients. This method is for testing the differences between means of independent samples. In this case, using SPSS and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) and Tukey post-hoc analysis performed a One-way ANOVA. F-tests were also carried out to determine significance between means of the variables, time of first ambulation, bowel movement, total PCA demand and total PCA doses. Statistical significance is based on P value with P < 0. 05; clinical beneficial is based on P < 0. 10. The results indicated that the means and standard deviations of the four groups were within a close range. Forty-seven women who had hysterectomies met the criteria. The women were randomly allocated to four different groups. Except for those in the control group, treatment was given by an acupuncturist preoperatively and consisted of a course of either sham, low or high frequency stimulation. All groups were assessed during the postoperative period for 24 hours. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to determine the amount of perceived pain felt by each subject. It was a 0 - 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being most severe pain. The data was collected over a 24 -hour period commencing post operatively. The significant differences between the groups at each specific time interval were examined. Results showed a clearly decreasing trend in the amount of pain felt over the 24 -hour period for all the four groups with respect to the PCA and time. Significant differences or clinical benefits were found between the means at two hours post-operatively with F(3, 42) = 2. 66 at p< 0. 10; three hours post-operatively, F(3, 42) = 3. 68; p< 0. 05, four hours post-operatively, F(3, 42) = 4. 33, p< 0. 05; eight hours post-op, F(3, 42) = 3. 33, p< 0. 05; sixteen hours post-op, F(3, 42) = 4. 25, p< 0. 05; and twenty-four hours, F(3, 42) = 4. 67, p< 0. 01. Further post-hoc analysis showed that at one hour post-operatively, groups one and four were different to each other at the p< 0. 10 level. At three hours, group 1 (M= 6. 05) was significantly higher, at the p< 0. 05 level, than group 4 (M= 3. 00). This difference was also found at four hours, group 1 (M= 5. 65) and group four (M= 2. 71); eight hours, group 1 (M= 4. 808) and group four (M= 2. 57); sixteen hours, group 1 (M= 4. 46) and group 4 (M= 2. 0); and twenty - four hours, group 1 (M= 3. 50) and group 4 (M= 1. 21). Both post-hoc comparison tests indicate that group 4 was significantly different from groups 1, 2, and 3 at twenty-four hours. Differences between the means (M) over the four time intervals for Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) doses requirement were also examined. Significant differences were found with F(3, 43) = 3. 69 at p< 0. 05, in the Post Operative Room (POR) between the groups. Post-hoc analysis confirmed that group 4 (M= 2. 30) was significantly lower than groups 2 (M= 5. 17), and 3 (M= 4. 58). Post-hoc comparison tests indicate that mean PCA doses in the POR, for group 4 was significantly different from group 2 and 3. Mean PCA doses between groups 1 and 4 have no differences. Differences between the groups between one and eight hours post-operatively were also found with F(3, 43) = 2. 33 at p< 0. 10. However, post-hoc analysis did not confirm this finding between any of the four groups. To compare the mean amount of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) demands of the four groups over the 24 hours post-operative, a one-way ANOVA with S. N. K and Tukey-HSD post-hoc tests were applied. The results showed that the four groups had a similar trend within 24 hours postoperatively. However, significant differences were found between the means at the Post Operating room with F(3, 43) = 4. 80 at p< 0. 01, and 1 to 8 hours postoperative with F(3, 43) = 3. 49 at p< 0. 05. Post-hoc analysis confirmed the significant difference between the means at 1 to 8 hours postoperative as group 2 (M= 55. 75) was significantly higher than group 4 (M= 22. 30). Post-hoc analysis also confirmed that group 2 (M= 30. 83) was significantly higher than group 3 (M= 13. 00) and group 4 (M= 5. 90) at the POR. No other significance was found between means. The results of PCA doses demanded by subjects indicated that there was no significant difference between the total PCA doses given for the four groups over twenty-four hour period post-operatively. However, a one way ANOVA was applied to compare the groups for total PCA doses demanded and significant differences were found between the groups with F(3, 42) = 3. 59 at p< 0. 05. Post-hoc analysis confirmed the difference between groups 1 (M= 84. 54) and 4 (M= 41. 60). Moreover, differences were found between the four groups for the amount of analgesia delivered in mg, F(3, 43) = 2. 45, p< 0. 10. Post-hoc analysis confirmed this finding between group one (M= 38. 63) and four (M= 29. 29). The thesis concludes with a discussion of methodological issues related to conducting randomized, placebo-controlled trials of electro-acupuncture and goals for future research in this area of pain management. Treatment outcome of SSP needless electro-acupuncture showed an improvement of the time of first bowel movement and ambulation, opioid related side effects, total amount of PCA demand, and total amount of PCA doses. The clinical significance of this particular study is of great interest, especially for those patients who wish for a non-pharmacological analgesia without side effects. Although further study is needed to ultimately determine whether SSP needle-free electro-acupuncture (EA) has a place in postoperative pain treatment, this study has suggested that SSP needle-free EA does have a place as an adjunct to standard medical care for post-operative surgical pain. Arguably this ‘needle free approach’ has benefits for patients who have difficulties with traditional acupuncture needling and at the same time are interested in a non-pharmacological approach to treating pain. ...|$|R
