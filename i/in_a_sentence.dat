50|$|The {{position}} of <b>a</b> noun <b>in</b> <b>a</b> German <b>sentence</b> has {{no bearing on}} its being a subject, an object or another argument. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> declarative <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> Unish, <b>a</b> prefix is {{attached}} to <b>a</b> main verb <b>in</b> making <b>a</b> passive <b>sentence.</b> <b>A</b> passive <b>sentence</b> is formed from <b>an</b> active <b>sentence</b> by inserting the verb “es” {{in front of the}} active verb and changing the subject-object order. In specifying the agent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passive <b>sentence,</b> the preposition “de” is used.|$|R

25|$|Although they do exist, possessive {{articles}} in Tunisian Arabic {{are not used}} {{the same way as}} in English. They mainly show possession valorization <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> Furthermore, they are only used after a definite noun.|$|E
50|$|Sabir {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge, but was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison <b>in</b> 2007. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentencing</b> statement, Sabir {{maintained}} his innocence and claimed that Shah had set him up. He is scheduled for release in 2027.|$|R
5000|$|In linguistics, {{scheme is}} {{a figure of}} speech that changes the normal {{arrangement}} of words <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence's</b> structure. <b>A</b> good example of a playwright who is notable for his use of schemes and tropes is William Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Julius Caesar).|$|R
40|$|It {{has often}} been claimed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{transformational}} grammar that <b>an</b> active <b>sentence</b> and its passive counterpart convey the same meaning and are, therefore, interchangeable. This may be true in single-sentence level, but is hardly so in discourse level. This paper {{is an attempt to}} make clear how active or passive sentences are used in discourse, and proposes the following:the subject <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passive <b>sentence</b> must be introduced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> preceding <b>sentence</b> and, when the by-agent (the underlying subject) is also introduced, it must be the topic in the preceding <b>sentence.</b> The subject <b>in</b> <b>an</b> active <b>sentence,</b> on the other hand, is perfectly free from this sort of restriction and need not be introduced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> preceding <b>sentence.</b> Furthermore, this active-passive relationship can also be seen in discourses consisting of three successive sentences. ある能動文とそれに対応する受動文は,一文の領域-文の文法-においては,変形文法等が示すようにわずかな場合を除いて,相互に置換可能であり,何ら意味変化をきたさず一対一に対応している。しかし一文の領域を越えて,それらが実際の談話の中に組み込まれると,両者は必ずしも置換可能ではない。本論は,能動文・受動文が談話においてどのような相互関係のもとで使用されているかを考察し,次の三点を提唱する。(1) 受動文の主語は,それに先行する文中においてすでに導入されていなければならない。そして受動文のby以下(論理主語) も同時に先行文において導入されている場合は,受動文の主語は先行文のトピック(話題) でなければならない。(2) 一方,能動文の主語は,上記のような制限はなく,先行文で導入される必要はない。(3) (1),(2) の規則は,談話がさらに発展し,三文に連なる場合においても適用され得...|$|R
25|$|Contrary to many {{languages}} of Vanuatu, Araki did not retain the noun article *na of Proto Oceanic, {{nor any other}} obligatory noun determiner. As a consequence, a noun root on its own can form a valid NP <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
25|$|An em dash (or an en dash) denotes a break <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> or {{to set off}} parenthetical statements. Glitter, felt, yarn, and buttons—his kitchen {{looked as}} if a clown had exploded.A flock of sparrows—some of them juveniles—alighted and sang.|$|E
25|$|Prosody in Swedish often varies {{substantially}} {{between different}} dialects including the spoken varieties of Standard Swedish. As in most languages, stress {{can be applied}} to emphasize certain words <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> To some degree prosody may indicate questions, although less so than in English.|$|E

25|$|Bengali nouns are not {{assigned}} gender, {{which leads}} to minimal changing of adjectives (inflection). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately declined (altered depending on their function <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence)</b> into four cases while verbs are heavily conjugated, and the verbs do not change form depending on {{the gender of the}} nouns.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{word order}} in a Nobiin {{sentence}} is subject–object–verb. Objects {{are marked by}} an object suffix -gá, often assimilating to the final consonant of the word (e.g. kìtááb 'book', kìtááppá 'book-OBJECT' as seen below). <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> containing both an indirect and a direct object, the object marker is suffixed to both.|$|E
25|$|On June 11, 2002, Attias {{was convicted}} in a jury trial of four counts of second-degree murder. He was acquitted of driving under the influence. One week later, the same jury found that Attias was legally insane. This {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of up to 60 years at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino.|$|E

50|$|Ordinance 17 Victoria Number 7 {{was only}} invoked {{three times in}} the Convict era of Western Australia. <b>In</b> one case, <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of death was not passed; and <b>in</b> another, <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of death was passed but the sentenced men were {{subsequently}} reprieved by the governor. The only occasion on which <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of death secured using the ordinance was subsequently carried out was in the trial of Robert Palin, who was hanged for robbery with violence.|$|R

25|$|The {{enclitic}} particles can {{be attached}} to any word <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> but most often they {{are attached to the}} first phrase of the sentence or to the verb. They are much more diverse and frequent in the Mitanni letter than in Old Hurrian. Common ones include =ān (and), =mān (but), =mmaman (to be sure) and =nīn (truly!).|$|E
25|$|For example, Hier, ostie, j'ai eu du sex en masse, tabarnak!. In this example, ostie {{is used as}} a comma, and tabarnak is used as {{an exclamation}} mark. This use of swearwords differs in that it serves a {{grammatical}} purpose <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> Rarely, some sacres will be used like a question mark, semi-colon, or even as a colon.|$|E
25|$|Nouns {{indicate}} persons, animals, {{inanimate objects}} or abstract ideas. Mixtec has few nouns for abstract ideas; {{when they do}} not exist, it uses verbal constructions instead. When a noun is followed by another <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> the former serves as the nucleus of the phrase, with the latter acting as a modifier. In many such constructions, the modifier possesses the nucleus.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{indexing}} theory, each phrase <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> can {{be given}} a unique index, which is a number (or letter) that identifies that phrase as picking out a particular entity in the world. It is possible to modify the indexes on these phrases so that two or more phrases have the same index. This is called co-indexation. If co-indexation occurs, the phrases with the same-numbered index will all refer to the same entity. This phenomenon is called co-reference.|$|E
25|$|A suffix (ek) is {{attached}} to a stem (gövde). A stem may be a root (kök) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (yapım ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (çekim ekleri). A constructive suffix makes a new word from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{arguments}} against this, by Pylkkänen and by Hole, state otherwise. Pylkkänen's argument, about low applicatives and high applicatives, states {{that on a}} syntax tree level, low applicatives have an applicative morpheme below the verb <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> and involve an additional v, or pronoun maker. In looking at the German examples, (40) is deemed ungrammatical due to the possessor-raising and misplacement of the pronoun maker, or lack of a bound variable interpretation. To Pylkkänen, (39) is considered a low applicative sentence, and grammatical.|$|E
