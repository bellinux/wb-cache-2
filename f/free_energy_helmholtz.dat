40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of PhysicsRobert SzoszkiewiczNanoscale {{modifications}} of polymer surfaces by scratching them with sharp tips with curvature radii {{of tens of}} nanometers and at variable temperatures are expected to provide wealth of information characterizing wear response of these polymers. Such studies are important {{in the light of}} understanding the nanoscale behavior of matter for future applications in advanced polymer coatings. This thesis describes how Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and hot-tip AFM (HT-AFM) methods were used to characterize thermal and mechanical properties of a 30 nm thick film of poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide), PS-b-PEO, and modify its lamellar surface patterns. Additionally, it is revealed how contact AFM and HT-AFM methods can efficiently characterize the wear response of two popular polymer surfaces, poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, and polystyrene, PS. The AFM and HT-AFM studies on PS-b-PEO copolymer were aimed at producing spatial alignment of respective PS and PEO parts. Instead, however, surface ripples were obtained. These measurements are explained using mode I crack propagation model and stick-and-slip behavior of an AFM tip. In addition, HT-AFM studies allowed extraction of several thermo-physical properties of a PS-b-PEO film at local volumes containing about 30 attograms of a polymer. These thermo-physical quantities are: PEO melting enthalpy of, 111 ± 88 J g[superscript]- 1, PS-b-PEO local specific heat of 3. 6 ± 2. 7 J g[superscript]- 1 K[superscript]- 1, and molecular <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> of <b>Helmholtz</b> of 10 [superscript]- 20 J nm[superscript]- 2 for the PEO within PS-b-PEO.

Cross-sections along the obtained spiral wear patterns provided plots of polymer corrugation as a function of scanning speed.

This derivative is called the reaction Gibbs energy (or energy change) and corresponds to the difference between the chemical potentials of reactants and products at the composition of the reaction mixture.

40|$|In {{numerical}} analysis of geotechnical problems {{it is often}} necessary to use sophisticated elastoplastic constitutive models. Particularly, the presence of friction as the fundamental mechanism to dissipate energy provides most of the models used in this field with a non-associated character. This characteristic introduces theoretical and numerical complexity at time of deriving the models from thermo-mechanical principles and implementing them. The paper presents the formulation and implementation {{for a family of}} non-associated models based on the hyper-plasticity approach. The paper starts with the hyper-plastic framework, that proves to be a powerful technique to derive evolution equations using standard thermo-mechanical procedures based on the differentiation of the <b>energy</b> expressions (<b>free</b> <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>energy</b> fs, Gibbs energy gs, and dissipation d), even for non-associated laws. The characterization of the variational structure behind the discrete equations of the Interior-Point projection of approximation is discussed in the second part. Thirdly is described the implementation of the models using convex programming theory. The integration of the incremental response is achieved following a classical primal-dual interior-point algorithm which presents good performance to resolve saddle-point problems. This algorithm has the particularity to solve the optimality conditions associated with a suitably penalized mathematical program taking Newton steps or damped Newton steps toward points on the central path or quasi-central path previously de ned. The global convergence characteristic of the algorithm is achieved introducing an appropriate line search scheme.

40|$|Many {{chemical}} or physical modification processes significantly influence {{the accessibility of}} fiber forming polymers by causing structural changes. The wettability and sorption ability improvements of polymeric materials are major tasks during finishing processes. Different pre-treatment processes are used {{in order to improve}} the accessibility of dissociable groups, hydrophilicity, dyeability, and whiteness. These are usually alkaline purification, chemical bleaching and mercerization. In a previous paper we presented the data for structural characteristics (density, crystallinity index, molecular orientation, void volume, diameter and the specific inner surface of void, etc.) of untreated regenerated cellulose fibers (viscose, modal and lyocell) [41]. We now compare the influence of different pre-treatment processes on fiber structure and the accessibility of the chemical groups of these fibers. In order to improve the accessibility, two pre-treatment processes were used: chemical bleaching of fibers and tensionless alkali treatment. The influence of these pre-treatment processes on the structure parameters was evaluated using viscosity measurements (determination of polymerization degree (DIN 54 270)) and iodine sorption ability measurements according to the Schwertassek method (determination of crystallinity index) [13, 16]. The reactivity and accessibility in a polar environment was determined using tensiometry. Contact angles between the fibers and liquids of different polarities were determined using the powder contact angle method and calculated from a modified Washburn equation [26, 28]. The surface <b>free</b> (<b>Helmholtz)</b> <b>energy</b> of differently treated fibers was determined from the contact angle data using the Owens-Wendt-Raeble-Kaelble approximation [30, 33, 35]. The differences in the accessibility of raw and pre-treated regenerated cellulose fibers obtained using tensiometry are compared with the results of the conventional method used to determine moisture adsorption (DIN 54 351, DIN 53 802). In regard to raw fibers, viscose shows the most hydrophilic characteristic: adsorbs the highest amount of moisture, has the fastest penetration velocities (Fig. 6), the smallest contact angle, and the highest SFE (Fig. 8). Modal fibers have the largest contact angle, the lowest SFE, and they adsorb the smallest amount of water vapor. Pre-treatments increase the sorption ability and the surface <b>free</b> (<b>Helmholtz)</b> <b>energy</b> while they decrease the contact angle. This makes the material more accessible to water and chemicals used in the finishing processes although the crystallinity index increases. The main modification in polymer properties caused by the treatments is an increase in the fiber SFE caused by an increase of the fiber surfaces because of swelling in the alkaline medium (washing, slack-mercerization), and due to an increase of accessible OH- and COOH-groups (bleaching). This enables the formation of an increased number of hydrogen bridges between the water molecules and the OH- and COOH-groups. Our investigations confirm the results published earlier thatthe main property necessary for the proper sorption behavior of cellulose materials are the accessible, less ordered regions and not the degree of crystallinity...|$|R
40|$|A {{formulation}} of elastic-plastic theory for rate independent materials is described, {{based on the}} use of thermodynamic potentials. The four energy functions commonly used in thermodynamics (internal <b>energy,</b> <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>free</b> <b>energy,</b> enthalpy and Gibbs <b>free</b> <b>energy)</b> are used to provide descriptions depending on which combinations of the stress, strain, temperature and entropy are taken as the independent variables. Much use is made of Legendre transformations to establish the links between the different energy functions. Dissipative behaviour is introduced through the use of kinematic internal parameters, and their conjugate variables, which are termed generalized stresses. A dissipation function or a yield function is used to describe the irreversible behaviour, and these are related by a degenerate case of the Legendre transformation. A central theme is that the constitutive behaviour is entirely determined by the knowledge of two scalar potentials. A systematic presentation is made of 16 possible ways of formulating constitutive behaviour within this framework. From four of these forms it is possible to establish the incremental response entirely by differentiation of the two potentials and by standard matrix manipulation. Examples are provided of the forms of the potentials for certain simple cases. The paper builds on previous work by Ziegler and other authors, and extends and generalizes work by Collins and Houlsby to include thermal effects...|$|R
