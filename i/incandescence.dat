5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the <b>incandescence</b> of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe. A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating {{a plate of}} metal to <b>incandescence,</b> an event that could be recorded by instruments located {{at the far end}} of a long, very straight pipe.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2014, {{rockfall}} {{events at}} the southeastern rim of the crater and heightened seismic activity caused PHIVOLCS to increase the alert level for Mayon from 2 to 3, which indicates relatively high unrest with magma at the crater, and that hazardous eruption is possible within weeks. The rockfalls and visible <b>incandescence</b> of the crater from molten lava and hot volcanic gas both indicated a possible incipient breaching of the growing summit lava dome.|$|E
25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} <b>incandescence,</b> which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (<b>incandescence).</b> The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E
25|$|Lightning is a {{dramatic}} natural example of static discharge. While the details are unclear and remain a subject of debate, the initial charge separation {{is thought to be}} associated with contact between ice particles within storm clouds. In general, significant charge accumulations can only persist in regions of low electrical conductivity (very few charges free to move in the surroundings), hence the flow of neutralizing charges often results from neutral atoms and molecules in the air being torn apart to form separate positive and negative charges, which travel in opposite directions as an electric current, neutralizing the original accumulation of charge. The static charge in air typically breaks down in this way at around 10,000 volts per centimeter (10 kV/cm) depending on humidity. The discharge superheats the surrounding air causing the bright flash, and produces a shock wave causing the clicking sound. The lightning bolt is simply a scaled-up version of the sparks seen in more domestic occurrences of static discharge. The flash occurs because the air in the discharge channel is heated to such a high temperature that it emits light by <b>incandescence.</b> The clap of thunder {{is the result of the}} shock wave created as the superheated air expands explosively.|$|E
500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, I {{felt the need}} to work on a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on little things. I am interested only in spectacles that rise above themselves". He first considered Goethe's Faust but then directed in 1981 Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt for Villeurbane and Paris, aiming at [...] "an <b>incandescence</b> of theatrical experience, a global spectacle".|$|E
500|$|From 1934 to 1939 Reich {{conducted}} what {{he called}} the bion experiments, which he published as Die Bione: Zur Entstehung des vegetativen Lebens in Oslo in February 1938 (published in English in 1979 and later called The Bion Experiments on the Origin of Life). He examined protozoa and grew cultured vesicles using grass, sand, iron and animal tissue, boiling them and adding potassium and gelatin. Having heated the materials to <b>incandescence</b> with a heat-torch, he wrote that he had seen bright, glowing, blue vesicles. He called them [...] "bions" [...] and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway between life and non-life. He wrote that when he poured the cooled mixture onto growth media, bacteria were born, dismissing the idea that the bacteria were already present in the air or on other materials.|$|E
500|$|The impact {{would have}} caused a megatsunami over [...] tall that would have reached {{all the way to}} what are now Texas and Florida. The height of the tsunami was limited by the {{relatively}} shallow sea {{in the area of the}} impact; in deep sea it would have been [...] tall. A cloud of super-heated dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second. Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to <b>incandescence</b> upon re-entry, broiling the Earth's surface and possibly igniting wildfires; meanwhile, colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only [...] thick in New Jersey some [...] away from the impact site, indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{daughter}} Jennifer {{stated that}} her father made hundreds of friends {{from all walks of}} life, and that their house was frequently visited by the likes of Frank and Barbara Sinatra, Quincy Jones, Gregory Peck and his wife Veronique, Johnny Carson and his wife, Kirk Kerkorian and Merv Griffin. She said that Grant and Sinatra were the closest of friends and that both men were remarkably similar in that they both shared a similar radiance and [...] "indefinable <b>incandescence</b> of charm", and were eternally [...] "high on life". While raising Jennifer, Grant archived artifacts of her childhood and adolescence in a bank-quality, room-sized vault he had installed in the house. Jennifer attributed this meticulous collection to the fact that artifacts of his own childhood had been destroyed during the Luftwaffe's bombing of Bristol in the Second World War (an event that also claimed the lives of his uncle, aunt, cousin, and the cousin's husband and grandson), and he may have wanted to prevent her from experiencing a similar loss.|$|E
500|$|Biographers Morecambe and Stirling {{believe that}} Cary Grant was the [...] "greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known". Schickel stated {{that there are}} [...] "very few stars who achieve the {{magnitude}} of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order", and {{thought that he was}} the [...] "best star actor there ever was in the movies". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the <b>incandescence</b> of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he [...] "embodies what seems a happier time−a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer." ...|$|E
500|$|The light curves for TypeIa {{are mostly}} very uniform, with a {{consistent}} maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. [...] Their optical energy output {{is driven by}} radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days). These radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to <b>incandescence.</b> Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the [...] "standard candles" [...] of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. [...] The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but {{this is only a}} hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. [...] After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Joule heating is {{sometimes}} useful, {{for example in}} electric stoves and other electric heaters (also called resistive heaters). As another example, incandescent lamps rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows [...] "white hot" [...] with thermal radiation (also called <b>incandescence).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In a {{laboratory}} under normal gravity conditions {{and with a}} closed oxygen valve, a Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) at around [...] This is due to <b>incandescence</b> of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. With increasing oxygen supply, less black body-radiating soot is produced due to a more complete combustion and the reaction creates enough energy to excite and ionize gas molecules in the flame, leading to a blue appearance. The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ≈565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|A notable exception, {{discovered}} in the early 19th century, {{is the use of}} a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to <b>incandescence</b> by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. [...] These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does. Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.|$|E

60|$|Slowly {{by degrees}} as one million of years {{followed}} another, this {8} fiery scene would lose its eruptive <b>incandescence.</b> The vapours {{in the sky}} would rain down and become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of solidifying rock would appear upon {{the surface of the}} molten sea, and sink under it, to be replaced by other floating masses. The sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with diminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now, because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far below <b>incandescence,</b> and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a series of eclipses and full moons.|$|E
60|$|When {{the small}} party {{finally reached the}} edge of the wood the greyish light of this dismal day had changed in the west to a dull reddish glow--a glow that had neither {{brilliance}} nor <b>incandescence</b> in it; only a weird tint that hung over the horizon and turned the distance into lines of purple.|$|E

6000|$|Proverbial {{philosophy}} {{asserts that}} the iron should be struck when it is hot. I sympathise with proverbial philosophy in this case, but that teacher says nothing whatever about striking the iron when it is cold; and experience--at least that of blacksmiths--goes to prove that cold iron may be struck till heat is evolved, and, once heated, who knows what intensity of <b>incandescence</b> may be attained? ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{this law}} can be duly comprehended, a few {{examples}} must be looked at. When one body is struck against another, that which we usually regard as the effect, is a change of position or motion in one or both bodies. But a moment's thought shows us {{that this is a}} careless and very incomplete view of the matter. Besides the visible mechanical result, sound is produced; or, to speak accurately, a vibration in one or both bodies, and in the surrounding air: and under some circumstances we call this the effect. Moreover, the air has not only been made to vibrate, but has had sundry currents caused in it by the transit of the bodies. Further, there is a disarrangement of the particles of the two bodies in the neighbourhood of their point of collision; amounting in some cases to a visible condensation. Yet more, this condensation is accompanied by the disengagement of heat. In some cases a spark--that is, light--results, from the <b>incandescence</b> of a portion struck off; and sometimes this <b>incandescence</b> is associated with chemical combination.|$|E
60|$|And Mulligan Jacobs's face thrust another inch closer on its twisted neck, {{while all}} his {{concentrated}} rage {{seemed on the}} verge of bursting into <b>incandescence.</b> So immense and tremendous was the bitterness that consumed him that he could find no words to clothe it.

60|$|It {{would have}} been a duller man than Bertram Wooster who had failed to note that the dear old chap was a bit steamed up. Whether his eyes were {{actually}} shooting forth flame, I couldn't tell you, but there appeared {{to me to be a}} distinct <b>incandescence.</b> For the rest, his fists were clenched, his ears quivering, and the muscles of his jaw rotating rhythmically, as if he were making an early supper off something.|$|E
60|$|They {{had risen}} so far over {{the crest of}} the hill that the whole west sky was revealed. Between the broken clouds they could see far into the {{recesses}} of heaven, the eye journeying on under a species of golden arcades, and past fiery obstructions, fancied cairns, logan-stones, stalactites and stalagmite of topaz. Deeper than this their gaze passed thin flakes of <b>incandescence,</b> till it plunged into a bottomless medium of soft green fire.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon the {{two could}} not help encountering each other at times. But whether because the {{obstacle}} had {{been the source of}} the love, or from a sense of error, and because Mrs. Maumbry bore a less attractive look as a widow than before, their feelings seemed to decline from their former <b>incandescence</b> to a mere tepid civility. What domestic issues supervened in Vannicock's further story the man in the oriel never knew; but Mrs. Maumbry lived and died a widow.|$|E
60|$|A hugely banked entrenchment {{overhung}} {{the chalk}} pit, in which stood the house, a monstrous squat Egyptian shape that Cossar had built for his sons when the Giant Nursery had served its turn, and behind {{was a great}} dark shed that might have covered a cathedral, in which a spluttering <b>incandescence</b> came and went, and from out of which came a Titanic hammering to beat upon the ear.

60|$|Austin {{had been}} gone a {{fortnight}} when Jacinta and Muriel Gascoyne sat under the lee of the Estremedura's deck-house one morning, {{on their way to}} Las Palmas. Above them the mastheads swung languidly athwart a cloudless sweep of blue, and the sea frothed in white <b>incandescence</b> about the lurching hull below as the little yacht-like steamer reeled eastwards with a rainbow in the spray that whirled about her bows. Astern of her the Peak's white cone gleamed above its wrappings of fleecy mist, and ahead on the far horizon Grand Canary swam a purple cloud.|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} big red fires, partly made up of coke and partly of coal, wherein only here and there tiny blue flames flit waywardly, and in the {{building}} up of which hotel servants are usually past masters. The glowing coal heaped up high in the old-fashioned grate presented a wonderful picture of mysterious architecture: streets and lanes of crimson <b>incandescence,</b> palaces and towers of molten heat, and the little blue flames dancing and peeping out from the fiery depths, mocking and wayward, twirling and twisting as with the joy of life.|$|E
60|$|There is a stream: {{actually}} a long tress of a water-fall pouring {{into a little}} gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts. They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness {{in the shadow of}} the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale <b>incandescence</b> of naked limbs and myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the shadow envelopes them.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the young}} giant rose {{a little black}} figure became visible to him against that western <b>incandescence</b> {{on the top of}} the {{embankment}} that towered above the summit of the down.

60|$|The heavens are {{strange and}} proud all the winter, their {{progress}} goes on {{without reference to}} the dim earth. The dawns come white and translucent, the lake is a moonstone in the dark hills, then across the lake there stretches a vein of fire, then a whole, orange, flashing track over the whiteness. There is the exquisite silent passage of the day, and then at evening the afterglow, a huge <b>incandescence</b> of rose, hanging above and gleaming, {{as if it were the}} presence of a host of angels in rapture.

60|$|She {{stood still}} in the archway, astounded. The sea was blazing with white fire, and glowing with azure as coals glow red with heat below the flames.

It {{was a moment of}} astonishment, when she stood breathless and blinded, involuntarily {{offering}} herself for a thank-offering. She felt herself confronting God at home in His white <b>incandescence,</b> His fire settling on her like the Holy Spirit. Her lips were parted in a woman's joy of adoration.|$|E
