5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E

25|$|As an example, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of {{ice water}} in air at room temperature, the {{difference}} in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and {{not part of the}} room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} after Roberts' capture, the Royal James had to be {{abandoned}} because of worm damage. The Royal Rover headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and {{he was invited to}} call at the fort <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party {{on its way to the}} fort, shooting Davis dead.|$|E
25|$|Mohnke {{was born}} in Lübeck on 15 March 1911. His father, who shared his name with his son, was a cabinetmaker. After his father's death, {{he went to work}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> and {{porcelain}} manufacturer, eventually reaching a management position. He also held a degree in economics. Mohnke joined the Nazi Party with number 649,684 on 1 September 1931. Shortly thereafter, he joined the SS with number 15,541. Mohnke began with the rank of SS-Mann (private). After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, SS Headquarters in Berlin requested that all SS regiments submit three names of their best soldiers for transfer to a personal guard unit for Hitler. Mohnke was selected for the unit in March 1933. He was assigned to SS-Stabswache Berlin, which established its first guard at the original Reich Chancellery. By August, Mohnke was one of two company commanders. In September, the unit became known as the SS-Sonderkommando Berlin after the training units SS-Sonderkommando Zossen and SS-Sonderkommando Jüterbog merged with it under Dietrich's command. With the merger, Mohnke was transferred to the 2nd Battalion and given command of the 3rd Company.|$|E

500|$|For Littleton, {{the epitome}} of {{technique}} vs. content was {{to be found in}} factory-made art glass, where the division of labor was inflexible. Traditionally the art glass designer was a draftsman who made a conceptual drawing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> object, and then passed it along to industry craftsmen for execution. According to Littleton, the factory designer “...is frustrated by the peculiar misplacement of his skill, and his inclusion in a process where little experimentation or interference is permitted. As for the factory craftsman, his training under the apprenticeship system [...] "limited him to one phase in the production of glass. This training could not prepare anyone to function as an independent artist, but only to serve as a cog in the industrial machinery." ...|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding {{that she was in}} a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{associative}} use of recurring motifs, {{combined with}} unorthodox editing techniques, foreshadows key {{events in the}} film. [...] In Daphne du Maurier's novella it is Laura that wears a red coat, but in the film the colour is used to establish an association between Christine and the elusive figure that John keeps catching glimpses of. [...] Du Maurier's story actually opens in Venice following Christine's death from meningitis, but the decision was taken to change {{the cause of death}} to drowning and to include a prologue to exploit the water motif. The threat of death from falling is also ever present throughout the film: besides Christine falling into the lake, Laura is taken to hospital after her fall in the restaurant, their son Johnny is injured in a fall at boarding school, the bishop overseeing the church restoration informs John that his father was killed in a fall, and John himself is nearly killed in a fall during the renovations. Glass is frequently used as an omen that something bad is about to occur: just before Christine drowns, John knocks a glass of water over, and Johnny breaks a pane of glass; as Laura faints in the restaurant she knocks glassware off the table, and when John almost falls to his death in the church, a plank of wood shatters a pane of glass; finally, shortly before confronting the mysterious red clad figure, John asks the sisters <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of water, a piece of symbolism that prefigured Christine's death.|$|E

2500|$|A good {{transportation}} system made Wheeling an ideal location <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> factory during the 19th century.
