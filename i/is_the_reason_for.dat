5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E

Laxmi talks about an incident which could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> leaving. Narayana describes Shambhu as a crooked minded. Gopalayya describes that opposing Shambhu’s decision to join freedom movement may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> {{him to leave}} the place. At the same time Shankaramma also blames herself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his riddance. Each character explores their hidden feelings in their own way with Shivaramu.|$|R

5|$|In October 2012, Tanya and Max {{decide to}} remarry. Tanya wants Rainie {{to attend the}} wedding but doesn't {{know where she is}} and asks Cora to track her down. With help from Jack, Cora manages {{to get in touch with}} Rainie and {{arranges}} to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor Olivia (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.|$|E
5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised {{as a woman who}} talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E

5|$|Symmetry has {{a variety}} of causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be). More puzzling <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's axial tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E
5|$|While {{purchasing}} {{a plot of}} land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As {{he is about to}} kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to NIMHANS where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, the chief psychiatrist of the hospital uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. The psychiatrist declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini accepts Ambi's love, but Anniyan will cease to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.|$|E
