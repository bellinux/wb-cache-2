"Social e-shopping" merges shopping and social networking activities through social media online. Retailers employ social media to target teens and young adult consumers making {{social networking sites}} an essential venue to marketing practices and have begun to use Facebook commerce as it helps businesses facilitate and execute sales transactions. The research objectives were to investigate (1) whether personality traits (i. e., openness to experience, material resource needs, arousal needs) affected psychographic characteristics (i. e., market mavenism, social browsing, value consciousness) and intentions to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel, (2) whether psychographic characteristics affected gratifications (i. e., socializing, information-seeking) and intentions to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel, (3) whether gratifications affected intentions to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel, and (4) whether tie strength and homophily moderated the links between gratifications and intentions to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel within the Meta-Theoretical Model of Motivation and Personality developed by Mowen (2000). Participants (n = 601) were Facebook users from 18 to 44 years of age who had social shopping experience. They were drawn from a consumer panel. Data was collected through an online self-administered survey. Participants who were likely to social <b>e-shop</b> using Facebook {{for the purpose of}} information-seeking and socializing gratifications indicated that they intended to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel. Participants who were market mavens intended to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel. They were also likely to social <b>e-shop</b> for the purpose of socializing. Participants who were social browsers also intended to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel. They were also likely to social <b>e-shop</b> for the purposes of information-seeking and socializing. Participants who were value conscious intended to social <b>e-shop</b> apparel. They were also likely to social <b>e-shop</b> for the purpose of information-seeking. Participants who were open to experience were likely to be market mavens. Participants who needed arousal were likely to be social browsers. Participants who needed material resources were likely to be market mavens, social browsers, and to be value conscious.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} what factors affect the adoption of <b>e-shopping</b> (electronic shopping), why people adopt <b>e-shopping,</b> and what changes in activity – travel patterns will occur {{as a response to}} <b>e-shopping.</b> Very few studies to date, however, have investigated the impact of geographic context on people’s <b>e-shopping</b> behavior. This study reexamines the explanatory factors that are related to people’s <b>e-shopping</b> patterns through a study of the Columbus Metropolitan Area, OH. It focuses on the effect of accessibility to local shops and the residential context on the adoption of <b>e-shopping</b> and the frequency of buying online. Using an activity – Internet diary dataset, the results suggest that people with lower levels of accessibility to local shopping opportunities are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>e-shopping,</b> since the Internet enhances the efficiency of shopping by providing more product information and by eliminating the need of travel in the physical world.

Results indicate that city centres are most likely to face the substitution of <b>e-shopping</b> for in-store shopping, followed by city district centres. Surprisingly, village centres are less affected by <b>e-shopping</b> than city centres. Moreover, for neighbourhood and convenience centres the adverse effects of <b>e-shopping</b> are small. The probability of substituting <b>e-shopping</b> for in-store shopping at particular shopping locations is largely influenced by the extent to which people shop online, as well as personal and geographical factors. ...|$|E
