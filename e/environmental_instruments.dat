We characterize political equilibrium as an evolving policy compromise between special-interests, representing polluters, and the electorate. We identify three factors that play a key role in explaining the recent trend in instrument choice: increasingly ambitious environmental targets, learning-by-doing driven reductions in transaction costs associated with permit trading, and (abatement) cost-reducing technological progress...|$|R

The aim is to analyze the effects of environmental taxation and government spending on environmental protection as an <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments</b> on greenhouse gas emissions and gross inland energy consumption in the EU 15. The empirical study is performed using a VAR approach with the application of aggregated data of EU 15 over the period 1995 to 2012. The results provide the evidence that the reactions of greenhouse gas emission and gross inland energy consumption to the shocks of <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments</b> are strong, mainly in the short term and decay to zero after about 8 years. Further, the reactions of the <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments</b> to the shocks of greenhouse gas emission and gross inland energy consumption are also strong in the short term, however with the deferred effects. In addition, the results show that government spending on environmental protection together with gross inland energy consumption has stronger effect on greenhouse gas emissions than environmental taxes in EU 15 over the examined period.

5000|$|In {{environmental}} law and policy, market-based instruments (MBIs) are policy instruments that use markets, price, {{and other economic}} variables to provide incentives for polluters to reduce or eliminate negative environmental externalities. MBIs seek to address the market failure of externalities (such as pollution) by incorporating the external cost of production or consumption activities through taxes or charges on processes or products, or by creating property rights and facilitating {{the establishment of a}} proxy market for the use of <b>environmental</b> services. Market-based <b>instruments</b> are also referred to as economic instruments, price-based <b>instruments,</b> new <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments</b> (NEPIs) or new <b>instruments</b> of <b>environmental</b> policy.|$|R
40|$|In {{the realm}} of <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instrument</b> choice, there is great {{divergence}} between the recommendations of normative economic theory and positive political reality. Four gaps stand out. First, despite the advantages of market-based policy instruments, they {{have been used to}} a minor degree, compared with conventional, command-and-control instruments. Second, pollution-control standards have typically been much more stringent for new than for existing sources, despite the inefficiency of this approach. Third, in the few instances in which market-based instruments have been adopted, they have nearly always taken the form of grandfathered tradeable permits, rather than auctioned permits or pollution taxes, despite the advantages in some situations of these other instruments. Fourth, the political attention given to market-based <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments</b> has increased dramatically in recent years. We search for explanations for these four apparent anomalies by drawing upon intellectual traditions from economics, political science, and law. We find that all fit quite well within an equilibrium framework, based upon the metaphor of a political market. In general, explanations from economics tend to refer to the demand for <b>environmental</b> policy <b>instruments,</b> while explanations from political science refer to the supply side. Overall, we find that there are compelling theoretical explanations for the four apparent anomalies, although these theories have yet to be empirically verified. ...|$|R

40|$|Asia has {{experienced}} spectacular economic {{growth over the}} past two decades. However, this economic progress has come at a high cost. It has led to unprecedented environmental consequences. So this region needs to shift the conventional pattern of "develop first and then treat the pollution" to a trajectory of sustainable development. To that end, this paper examines a variety of policy responses, at national, regional and international levels, to deal with growing concerns about the environmental challenges in Asia. In the context of national responses, special attention is paid to the following issues: coordination between the central and local governments, market-based <b>environmental</b> <b>instruments</b> and industrial policies, tougher emissions standards for mobile and stationary sources and fuel quality, policies to promote energy efficiency and the use of clean energy and biofuels, the integration of environmental policies with economic and sectoral policies, and engagement of the private sector through e. g., ecolabelling, green government procurement, corporate ratings and disclosure programs, and drawing the support of financial institutions to promote improved corporate environmental performance. The paper concludes that having the right policy mix, coupled with strengthened cooperation at national, local and regional levels, will ensure continuing economic growth in the region without compromising its limited ecological-carrying capacity and environmental quality.
