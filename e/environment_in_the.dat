5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the <b>environment.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone {{can be traced back to}} an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite some signs of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E
5|$|Enchanted is {{the first}} feature-length Disney live-action/traditional {{animation}} hybrid since Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same method {{as they did in}} Roger Rabbit; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two aspect ratios; it begins in 2.35:1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even {{for the remainder of the}} cartoon sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the pillarboxed 4:3 aspect ration; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time. Enchanted took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} {{experienced}} on-ice success, it {{spent most of}} its first 23 years struggling financially. Quebec City {{was by far the}} smallest market in the league, and the second-smallest to host a team in the four major sports. The changing financial <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL made things even more difficult. In 1995, team owner Marcel Aubut asked for a bailout from Quebec's provincial government as well as a new publicly funded arena. The bailout fell through, and Aubut subsequently began talks with COMSAT Entertainment Group in Denver, which already owned the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Denver Nuggets. In May 1995, COMSAT announced an agreement in principle to purchase the team. The deal became official on July 1, 1995, and 12,000 season tickets were sold in the 37 days after the announcement of the move to Denver. Even though the team was losing money, when the team relocated, it still made a profit, it was sold so owner Marcel Aubut could make a profit off of the franchise.|$|E
