5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio {{state attorney general}} on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy {{in the office of}} the attorney <b>general</b> <b>was</b> created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann who was embroiled in a sex scandal.

Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience.

5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor <b>general</b> <b>was</b> half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
