50|$|There is not, {{and never}} will be, a one-size-fits-all {{approach}} to upgrading of informal settlements. Each settlement is unique in its challenges, but there are common themes. Informal settlement upgrading is not simply “site and service” or the provision of a “top structure” house. Upgrading is any intervention that improves the physical conditions of a settlement, which in turn enhances the lives of its inhabitants. The most critical emphasis is that this process should happen in situ, where communities already exist. Relocations should always be as a last resort. However, in situations {{in which they are}} unavoidable, such as in <b>flood</b> <b>planes</b> or along railway lines, the federations work to ensure that decisions are made in conjunction with the community. SDI projects do not deliver land, services and incremental houses as ends in themselves, but do so as a means to draw in politicians and policy makers in order to challenge and transform institutional arrangements and policies. For SDI this is not only a matter of delivery but also one of deepening democracy.|$|R

In order to manage such disasters in a rapid and highly efficient and coordinated manner, the optimal provisions of information concerning any crisis situation is an essential pre-requisite. Local Police, Fire departments, Public Health Department, Civil Defense, Military and other emergency response organizations must react efficiently yet individually but most importantly, in a coordinated manner. These results in the necessity for both intra and inter organization coordination at several hierarchy levels. Since coordination requires current information, such information must be communicated within and between organizations in real-time, the need arises for an integrated communication and information system solely designated or disaster management that provides processing of relevant efficient, reliable and secure exchange of information...|$|R
