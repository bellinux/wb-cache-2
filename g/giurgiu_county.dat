2500|$|The future {{writer was}} born in the eponymous Crevedia Mare, Vlașca County (now <b>Giurgiu</b> <b>County),</b> on [...] His parents were the peasants Ion Cârstea and his wife Floarea née Antonescu, {{described}} the poet as: [...] "well-to-do people of the plow. I am the first one in my family to have worn a necktie." [...] Crevedia also saw himself as [...] "purely Romanian and from a fully Romanian region", but was rumored to be of Bulgarian ethnicity. His birth name was Niculae (or Nicolae) Ion Cârstea, although he later had it officially changed to N. Crevedia, his pseudonym of choice.

2500|$|Fleva was {{eventually}} faced with accusations that, while in office, he had secretly engaged in contraband. Iepurescu, a <b>Giurgiu</b> <b>County</b> representative, questioned the Minister's provisions against fodder shortages. Iepurescu's story was that, against the specialists' advice, Fleva had ordered massive imports of hay for national or ministerial use. Some, beginning with Maiorescu, have questioned whether Iepurescu {{himself was a}} man of character. Fleva asked to present his version with a speech in Parliament, programmed for January 13, 1896. On January 12, Sturdza confirmed that Fleva had lost his office, implying that his activity during the elections was under scrutiny; when the Assembly began preparing procedures to oust him, Fleva became enraged, denouncing the National Liberal Party as an occult organization. He is believed to have coined the term Oculta ("The Occult [...] "), which was subsequently used to designate the secretive triumvirate of National Liberal figures, allegedly Sturdza's puppet-masters: Carada, Pache Protopopescu, Gogu Cantacuzino.|$|E
