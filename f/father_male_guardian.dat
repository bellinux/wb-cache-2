40|$|This study {{examined}} the postsecondary planning of African American and Hispanic high school seniors in five large urban school districts. Just prior to graduation in 2001, students from 23 high schools completed surveys and focus groups about their college planning. Students' educational expectations were high. Nearly all expected to earn at least a bachelor's degree, and most expected to earn graduate or professional degrees. Over 80 percent had been accepted to college, and 90 percent viewed college as an important means to future jobs and career goals. Maternal influence was a significant factor for most students. Nearly three-quarters reported that friends and peers were very or somewhat helpful in college planning. For those with a <b>father</b> or <b>male</b> <b>guardian</b> present, 43 percent considered him very helpful, and 19 percent considered him somewhat helpful. Nearly three-quarters said their teachers and counselors were very or somewhat helpful in college planning. Nearly all students believed their hig...|$|R

25|$|Among {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to higher education for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their <b>fathers</b> (or other <b>male</b> <b>guardians)</b> or their husbands. Finally, the lack of female employment opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{physical}} activity (PA) patterns and the hypothesized psychosocial and environmental determinants of PA in an ethnically diverse sample of obese and non-obese middle school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: One-hundred and thirty-three non-obese and 54 obese sixth grade children (mean age of 11. 4 ± 0. 6). Obesity status determined using the age-, race- and gender-specific 95 th percentile for BMI from NHANES- 1. MEASUREMENTS: Objective measurements were collected of PA over a 7 -day period using the CSA 7164 accelerometer: total daily counts; daily moderate (3 - 5. 9 METs) physical activity (MPA); daily vigorous physical activity (≥ 6 METs; VPA); and weekly number of 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥ 3 METs, MVPA). Self-report measures were collected of PA self-efficacy; social influences regarding PA, beliefs about PA outcomes; perceived PA levels of parents and peers, access to sporting and/or fitness equipment at home, involvement in community-based PA organizations; participation in community sports teams; and hours spent watching television or playing video games. RESULTS: Compared to their non-obese counterparts, obese children exhibited significantly lower daily accumulations of total counts, MPA and VPA as well as significantly fewer 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of MVPA. Obese children reported significantly lower levels of PA self-efficacy, were involved in significantly fewer community organizations promoting PA and were {{significantly less likely to}} report their <b>father</b> or <b>male</b> <b>guardian</b> as physically active. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that physical inactivity is an important contributing factor in the maintenance of childhood obesity. Interventions to promote PA in obese children should endeavor to boost self-efficacy perceptions regarding exercise, increase awareness of, and access to, community PA outlets, and increase parental modeling of PA...|$|R

30|$|Similarly, {{restricted}} access to government {{services such as}} licensing, options and restrictive regulatory environments and bureaucratic procedures were both on the higher note (4.51 - strongly agree). This finding may be an affirmation of the Saudi Arabian culture. Under Saudi law, all females must have a <b>male</b> <b>guardian,</b> typically a <b>father,</b> brother or husband (a mahram). Girls and women are forbidden from travelling, conducting official business, or undergoing certain medical procedures without permission from their <b>male</b> <b>guardian</b> (Arabian Gazette 2013). In addition, women continue to encounter a Wakeel (legal male representative) requirement when starting their businesses, as the enforcement of its removal is not consistent. Secondly, there is a legal requirement for a ‘Mudeer’ (male manager) for public-facing business. Despite its official repeal, many women are still required to appoint a male manager. Further, owing to restricted licensing options, a number of business activities that are popular among women, for example, home business, are not currently available in the official licensing categories. The driving ban on women in Saudi Arabia {{and the need for}} <b>male</b> <b>guardian</b> permission for international travel put women entrepreneurs at a significant disadvantage (Arabian Gazette, 2013). Moreover, most social enterprises in the region are legally registered as nonprofit organizations. Social entrepreneurs find themselves struggling with restrictive regulatory environments and bureaucratic procedures that often limit their ability to become sustainable or to scale up (Abdou et al., 2012).|$|R
