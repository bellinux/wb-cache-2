25|$|Several {{anticonvulsants}} {{are known}} to be highly teratogenic. Phenytoin, also known as diphenylhydantoin, along with carbamazepine is responsible for the fetal hydantoin syndrome, which may typically include broad nose base, cleft lip and/or palate, microcephalia, nails and fingers hypoplasia, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> and mental retardation. Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has anti-folate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as spina bifida.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>restrictions</b> cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|R

2500|$|Untreated {{celiac disease}} can cause {{spontaneous}} abortion (miscarriage), <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>restriction,</b> small for gestational age, low birthweight and preterm birth. Often reproductive disorders {{are the only}} manifestation of undiagnosed celiac disease and most cases are not recognized. Complications or failures of pregnancy cannot be explained simply by malabsorption, but by the autoimmune response elicited by the exposure to gluten, which causes damage to the placenta. The gluten-free diet avoids or {{reduces the risk of}} developing reproductive disorders in pregnant women with celiac disease. Also, pregnancy can be a trigger for the development of celiac disease in [...] genetically susceptible women who are consuming gluten.|$|E
2500|$|GH {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{conditions}} that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH. [...] Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader–Willi syndrome, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>restriction,</b> and severe idiopathic short stature. Higher ("pharmacologic") doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal ("physiologic"). Despite the higher doses, side-effects during treatment are rare, and vary little according to the condition being treated.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to carbon {{monoxide}} at toxic levels {{during the first}} two trimesters of pregnancy can lead to <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>restriction,</b> leading to a baby that has stunted growth and is born smaller than 90% of other babies at the same gestational age. [...] The effect of chronic exposure to {{carbon monoxide}} can depend on the stage of pregnancy in which the mother is exposed. Exposure during the embryonic stage can have neurological consequences, such as telencephalic dysgenesis, behavioral difficulties during infancy, and reduction of cerebellum volume. There are also possible skeletal defects that could result from exposure to carbon monoxide during the embryonic stage, such as hand and foot malformations, hip dysplasia, hip subluxation, agenisis of a limb, and inferior maxillary atresia with glossoptosis. Also, carbon monoxide exposure between days 35 and 40 of embryonic development can lead to an increased risk of the child developing a cleft palate. [...] Exposure to carbon monoxide or polluted ozone exposure can also lead to cardiac defects of the ventrical septal, pulmonary artery and heart valves. [...] The effects of carbon monoxide exposure are decreased later in fetal development during the fetal stage, but they may still lead to anoxic encephalopathy.|$|E
40|$|Propósito: Evaluar la correlación entre la ocurrencia de Restricción al Crecimiento Intrauterino (RCIU), RCIU selectivo (RCIUs) y Síndrome de Transfusión Feto-Fetal (STFF) y las características de la {{placenta}} en la gestación doble monocorial (GDM). Estimar cuál es la importancia de los hallazgos ecográficos y Doppler. Material y métodos: Entre enero del 2005 y enero de 2008 fueron evaluados 8 GDM. La corionicidad fue determinada con ecografía en el 1 º trimestre. Se realizaron seguimientos ecográficos evaluando cantidad de líquido amniótico, vejiga, peso fetal y Doppler de vasos fetales. Al nacimiento se tiñeron los vasos placentarios con colorantes no vitales y se evaluó la presencia y tipo de anastomosis, la distribución de los territorios y la calidad de inserción del cordón umbilical (CU) sea central (C), marginal (M) o velamentosa (V). Resultados: Seguimiento ecográfico: discrepancia de peso > 25 % (RCIUs) (n= 3); peso de ambos fetos &# 8804; percentil 3 (RCIU) (n= 1); signo ecográfico de STFF (n= 1); normales (n= 3). Seguimiento con Doppler: Flujo Ausente/Reverso intermitente (FA/Ri) en arteria umbilical (AU) (n= 4); signos de insuficiencia placentaria en AU (n= 3); normales (n= 2). Complicaciones perinatales evaluadas: STFF (n= 1); RCIUs (n= 2); RCIU (n= 1); ninguna (n= 4). Territorios placentarios: distribución igual (n= 6); distribución desigual (n= 2). Inserción del CU: ambos M (n= 3); ambos C (n= 2); una C y otra M(n= 2); una M y otra V (n= 1). Anastomosis vasculares: presencia de anastomosis arterio-arteriales (AAA) y anastomosis arterio-venosas (AAV) en ambas direcciones (n= 6); presencia de AAA y AAV en una dirección (n= 1); presencia de AAV en una dirección sin AAA(n= 1). El STFF se relacionó con ausencia de AAA y presencia de AV en una dirección. Los signos de insuficiencia placentaria en AU se dieron en los casos de RCIU. Los 2 RCIUs presentaron desigual distribución del territorio placentario. Conclusión: Las anastomosis vasculares están presentes en todas las GDM. Las anomalías de inserción del CU son frecuentes en GDM. En la GDM el RCIUs se relaciona con distribución desigual del territorio placentario. La presencia de FA/Ri en la AU de un feto sugiere la presencia de AAA, las que impedirían un STFF. Objective: To correlate {{between the}} appearence of <b>Intrauterine</b> Fetal <b>Growth</b> <b>Restriction</b> (IFGR), Selective <b>Intrauterine</b> Fetal <b>Growth</b> <b>Restriction</b> (SIFGR), Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) and macroscopic findings of placentas in Monochorionic Twin Gestations. To determine {{the importance of}} ultrasound and Doppler findings. Materials and methods: Between January 2005 and January 2008 we diagnosed 8 monochorionic twin pregnancies. Chorionicity was determined with first trimester ultrasound screening. Follow-up scans were done to assess amniotic fluid volume, bladders, fetal weight and fetal Doppler ultrasound. Alter delivery, we cannulated and dyed umbilical arteries and veins in order to characterise vascular anastomoses. We also evaluated distribution of the placenta plate, and type of cord insertion (central, marginal or velamentous). Results: Follow-up scans revealed: 3 cases with selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (SIFGR); 1 case with <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (IFGR); 1 case with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); and 3 normal pregnancies. Follow-up Doppler scans revealed: 4 cases with intermittent absent/reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow; 3 cases with signs of placental insufficiency; and 2 normal cases. Perinatal outcome: 1 case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); 2 cases of selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (SIFGR); 1 case of <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (IFGR); 4 healthy cases. Visual inspection of placental plate: equal placental sharing (6 cases); unequal placental sharing (2 cases). Types of cord insertion: both fetuses with marginal cord insertion (3 cases); both fetuses with central insertion (2 cases); one fetus with central {{and the other one}} with marginal insertion (2 cases); one fetus with marginal insertion and the other one with velamentous insertion (1 case). Vascular anastomoses: 6 cases presented arterio-arterial ansatomoses (AAA) and arterio-venous anastomoses (AVA) in both directions; 1 case showed AAA and AVA in only one direction; another case showed AVA in one direction without AAA. The only case of TTTS was related to the presence of AVA in one direction and the absence of AAA. Signs of placental insufficiency were seen in the case of <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (IFGR). Both cases of SIFGR showed unequal placental distribution. Conclusions: Vascular anastomoses are present in all cases of monochorionic twin gestations. anomalies in the cord insertion are frequent in this type of pregnancies. Selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> is related to unequal distribution of the placental plate. Intermittent absent/reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow in one of the fetuses suggests there are arterioarterial anastomoses, which are supposed to protect against twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Normal fetal growth {{depends on}} genetically {{predetermined}} growth potential and is modulated by fetal, placental, maternal and external factors.

40|$|Preeclampsia is {{a common}} {{complication}} of pregnancy associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality and <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction.</b> There is extensive evidence that the reduction of uteroplacental blood flow in this syndrome results from the toxic combination of hypoxia, imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, inflammation, and deranged immunity.

40|$|SummaryThe {{placenta}} {{provides the}} interface for gas and nutrient exchange between {{the mother and}} the fetus. Despite its critical function in sustaining pregnancy, the stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and molecular mechanisms responsible {{for the development of the}} placental exchange interface are poorly understood. We identified an Epcamhi labyrinth trophoblast progenitor (LaTP) in mouse placenta that at a clonal level generates all labyrinth trophoblast subtypes, syncytiotrophoblasts I and II, and sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells. Moreover, we discovered that hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling is required for sustaining proliferation of LaTP during midgestation. Loss of trophoblast c-Met also disrupted terminal differentiation and polarization of syncytiotrophoblasts, leading to <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction,</b> fetal liver hypocellularity, and demise.

40|$|<b>Intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (IUGR) is an {{important}} pregnancy complication associated with significant adverse clinical outcome, stillbirth, perinatal morbidity and cerebral palsy. To date, no uniformly accepted management protocol of Doppler surveillance that reduces mortality and cognitive morbidity has emerged. Aortic isthmus (AoI) evaluation has been proposed as a potential monitoring tool for IUGR fetuses. In this review, the current knowledge {{of the relationship between}} AoI Doppler velocimetry and preterm fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> is reviewed. Relevant technical aspects and reproducibility data are reviewed as we discuss AoI Doppler and its place within the existing repertoire of Doppler assessments in placental insufficiency. The AoI is a link between the right and left ventricles which perfuse the lower and upper body, respectively. The clinical use of AoI waveforms for monitoring fetal deterioration in IUGR has been limited, but preliminary work suggests that abnormal AoI impedance indices are an intermediate step between placental insufficiency-hypoxemia and cardiac decompensation. Further prospective studies correlating AoI indices with arterial and venous Doppler indices and perinatal outcome are required before encorporating this index into clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent that mild or moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia {{may be associated with}} adverse perinatal complications and outcomes. The placental pathology in 14 pregnancies from 11 women diagnosed retrospectively to have hyperhomocysteinaemia, following a recent history of <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction,</b> abruption or of thromboembolic disease, were reviewed. Most of the placental findings indicated abnormal placentation but these were not specific to maternal hyperhomocysteinaemia nor found in every placenta. Features observed included absence of trophoblast-induced physiological vascular changes, acute atherosis, intraluminal endovascular trophoblast in the third trimester, infarction, retroplacental haematoma formation and accelerated villous maturity. Uteroplacental vascular thrombosis was also seen. Three of the women had a subsequent pregnancy where they were treated empirically with folic acid, and these resulted in improved perinatal outcomes. The finding of placental pathology warrants investigation of the woman for hyperhomocysteinaemia.

These conditions, along with perinatal hypoxic risk and in utero ischemic damage, are frequently found in multiple gestations. In this context, a myocardial damage could be expected more frequently in multiple than in singleton births. We hypothesized that cord blood cardiac troponin T and troponin I, markers of myocardial damage, could be different between singleton and multiple pregnancies and, among twins, between the first- and the second-born twin. Troponins T and I and creatine kinase MB concentrations were not increased in twins at birth and were not different between the first- and the second-born twin.

40|$|Abstract Heme Oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{has been}} shown to play a pivotal role in {{pregnancy}} outcome and its ablation leads to abnormal placentation, <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> (IUGR) and subsequent intrauterine fetal death. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been found to mimic the protective effects of HO- 1 activity, rescuing HO- 1 -deficient fetuses. This gasotransmitter arises in biological systems during the oxidative catabolism of heme by HO. Here, we explored the potential of CO in preventing IUGR and established the optimal doses and therapeutic time window in a clinically relevant mouse model. We additionally investigated the pathways activated upon CO application in vivo. We established 50 ppm as the best lowest dose of CO necessary to prevent <b>growth</b> <b>restriction</b> being the optimal time frame during days 3 to 8 of mouse pregnancy. CO lead to higher fetal and placental weights and avoided fetal death without showing any pathologic effects.
