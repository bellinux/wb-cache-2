50|$|Gold and {{platinum}} {{are used}} for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for <b>gold</b> <b>doping.</b> At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.|$|E

Using CO and O 2 multi-pulse TAP experiments, the gold was found to modify the catalyst surface such that it stores much more oxygen that is active for the CO oxidation.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{numerical}} simulation {{of the effect of}} <b>gold</b> <b>doping</b> on the electrical characteristics of long silicon diodes exposed to neutron irradiation. The aim is to investigate the effect of gold on the hardness of the irradiated diodes.

The leakage current and the effective doping density are extracted from these two characteristics respectively. The hardness of the diodes is evaluated from the evolution of the leakage current and the effective doping density with irradiation doses.

The conduction mechanism is studied by the evolution of the current with temperature.

While a significant experimental and theoretical understanding is currently available on the structural and electronic properties of <b>doped</b> <b>gold</b> cages, very little information is available on their reactivity and catalytic behavior.

The enhancement in the O- 2 binding energy on the <b>doped</b> <b>gold</b> cages is also confirmed by a significant decrease in the Au-O and an increase in the O-O bond lengths, corroborated by a red shift (similar to 250 cm(- 1)) in the O-O stretching frequency as compared to the pristine cage.

Four different gold concentrations, 0, 10, 15, or 20 vol% were used to compare the influence of the gold precipitation on electrical conductivity and thermopower of the composites.

Various parameters which governed the switching behaviour of an MISS were investigated. In general the switching characteristics are similar to those of the tunnel oxide MISS. The geometrical dependence of the switching behaviour in the tunnel oxide MISS has been extended to the present device by looking at the effects of electrode area, junction area, electrode perimeters and of a metal guard ring. Other effects, such as SRO deposition time, work function difference, <b>gold</b> <b>doping,</b> heat treatment, light illumination and film ageing were also observed. The dynamic characteristic of the device was studied using a double pulse technique. The characteristics of the three-terminal SRO-MISS were studied in both forward and reverse bias.

The characteristics and theories of four-layer pnpn semiconductor devices have been considered with particular reference to the two transistor analogy of thyristor {{in order to obtain}} an expression for the current-voltage characteristics of the device. The Small-signal, low-frequency current gains of the npn and pnp transistor sections of high and low power thyristors were measured by a three terminal method originally employed by W. Fulop. The technique is shown to be applicable to measurements on high power thyristors. The current gains of two transistor component were also measured as a function of temperature at a series of anode currents. From this it can be shown that the temperature dependence of two-terminal latching current can be qualitatively estimated from the plot of current gain measured at a series of temperature for constant anode current. Analysis of instability of devices with temperature showed that-, the saturation current-of isolated centre junction plays a dominant role. <b>Gold</b> <b>doping</b> predictably leads to low current gain of the pnp transistor section. Current gain measurements of thyristors with and without shorting dot showed an. almost similar variation with frequency. For both type of devices αnpn 0 was almost equal and even closer at high temperature (1000 C). The theory of the influence of shorting dots on current flow in thyristors outlined in a report by W.

The voltage distribution in the two central base regions just after the device has switched on but before the plasma has had time to spread is investigated.
