50|$|The murine GSC {{niche in}} males, also called {{spermatogonial}} stem cell (SSC) niche, {{is located in the}} basal region of seminiferous tubules in the testes. The seminiferous epithelium is composed of sertoli cells that are in contact with the basement membrane of the tubules, which separates the sertoli cells from the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> below. This <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> comprises Leydig cells, macrophages, mesenchymal cells, capillary networks, and nerves.|$|E

50|$|It {{is related}} to the patient's state of hydration, but is not {{identical}} to it. For instance, intravascular volume depletion can exist in an adequately hydrated person if there is loss of water into <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> (e.g. due to hyponatremia or liver failure).|$|E
40|$|Within a {{few hours}} of {{transplantation}} the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system migrate into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> of the organ. The cells arrive on the vascular endothelium of the allotransplanted organ either as macrophages or as monocytes but on entering the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> they begin to enlarge, differentiate and undergo active pinocytosis. Along with the cell migration, which would appear to be their stimulus to migrate, is an extravasation of the protein-rich plasma. Erythrocytes also pass into the interstitium and, if effete, are contracted by monocyte-macrophages and phagocytosed in the classical manner. All through the natural history of an allotransplant new monocyte-macrophage recruits arrive the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> of the allotransplant. Some of these cells escape via the lymphatics but the vast majority accumulate in the allotransplant, interdigitate and fuse with one another but make no attempt to damage the tissues into which they have migrated. The reaction to an allotransplanted organ fits into the category of an aseptic inflammatory reaction and the only obvious role played by the mononuclear phagocyte system is the classical role of scavenging interstitial debris...|$|R

25|$|As {{a type of}} hematoma, {{a bruise}} is always caused by {{internal}} bleeding into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> which does not break through the skin, usually initiated by blunt trauma, which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces. Trauma sufficient to cause bruising can occur {{from a wide variety}} of situations including accidents, falls, and surgeries. Disease states such as insufficient or malfunctioning platelets, other coagulation deficiencies, or vascular disorders, such as venous blockage associated with severe allergies can lead to the formation of purpura which is not to be confused with trauma-related bruising/contusion. If the trauma is sufficient to break the skin and allow blood to escape the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues,</b> the injury is not a bruise but instead a different variety of hemorrhage called bleeding. However, such injuries may be accompanied by bruising elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Like most animal tissues, brain {{metabolism}} depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances. A {{limited amount of}} glucose {{can be derived from}} glycogen stored in astrocytes, but it is consumed within minutes. For most practical purposes, the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> within the central nervous system and into the neurons themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Third spacing is {{the unusual}} {{accumulation}} of fluid in a transcellular space. In medicine, {{the term is}} most commonly used with regard to burns, but also can refer to ascites and pleural effusions. With regard to severe burns, fluids may pool on the burn site (i.e. fluid lying outside of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue,</b> exposed to evaporation) and cause depletion of the fluids. With pancreatitis or ileus, fluids may [...] "leak out" [...] into the peritoneal cavity, also causing depletion of the intracellular, interstitial or vascular compartments.|$|E
50|$|Neutrophils are {{a type of}} {{phagocyte}} and {{are normally}} found in the bloodstream. During the beginning (acute) phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, environmental exposure, and some cancers, neutrophils are one of the first-responders of inflammatory cells to migrate towards the site of inflammation. They migrate through the blood vessels, then through <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue,</b> following chemical signals such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8), C5a, fMLP, Leukotriene B4 and H2O2 in a process called chemotaxis. They are the predominant cells in pus, accounting for its whitish/yellowish appearance.|$|E

50|$|When albumin is {{excreted}} in the urine, its serum (blood) concentration decreases. Consequently, the intravascular {{oncotic pressure}} reduces {{relative to the}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue.</b> The subsequent movement of fluid from the vascular compartment to the interstitial compartment manifests as the soft tissue swelling referred to as oedema. This fluid collects most commonly in the feet and legs, in response to gravity, particularly in those with poorly functioning valves. In severe cases, fluid can shift into the peritoneal cavity (abdomen) and cause ascites. As {{a result of the}} excess fluid, individuals with minimal change disease often gain weight, as they are excreting less water in the urine, and experience fatigue. Additionally, the protein in the urine causes it to become frothy.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the joint}} is {{surrounded}} by soft tissue, as in the shoulder and hip, fluid under pressure may leak out of the joint space through the surgical portals and collect in the patient's soft tissue. A typical arthroscopy can result in 1 - 3 liters of irrigation fluid being absorbed into the patient's <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue.</b> This buildup of irrigation fluid in the soft tissue may cause edema. This swelling can interfere with the arthroscopic procedure by collapsing the surgical space, or migrating into the patient's neck and causing airway blockage. In hip arthroscopy, a feared complication is abdominal flooding where the irrigation fluid leaks from the hip joint capsule and drains into the abdominal cavity. Risk factors for fluid extravasaton include procedure length (> 90 - 120 min), obesity, and age (> 45 - 50) with accompanying lack of muscle tone.|$|E
5000|$|Proliferative {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is characterised by a swollen kidney and spleen, bloody ascites, and pale gills, which {{indicate}} the fish becomes anemic at the late {{stage of the}} disease. Note that those symptoms are common amongst many other fish diseases and do not specifically indicate an infection with Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. It is important to clarify the pathologic condition only happens in species particularly susceptible or naïve to T. bryosalmonae. In those cases, the parasite is allowed to cross the renal tubules wall to proliferate within the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> of kidney (=histozoic proliferation). This proliferation stage is a dead end for the parasite (=extrasporogonic proliferation) but instead causes a tumultuous tumour-like tissue reaction in the kidney, inducing a chronic lymphoid hyperplasia marked by a strong parasite-driven immunosuppressant pathogenesis and a dysregulation of T-helper subsets [...] In advanced pathology stages, this chronic lymphoid hyperplasia causes the development of granulomatous-like lesions, thus resulting in the characteristic swelling of the whole kidney.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hypertensive" [...] {{refers to}} high blood {{pressure}} and [...] "nephropathy" [...] means damage to the kidney; hence this condition is where chronic {{high blood pressure}} causes damages to kidney tissue; this includes the small blood vessels, glomeruli, kidney tubules and <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues.</b> The tissue hardens and thickens which is known as nephrosclerosis. The narrowing of the blood vessels means less blood is going to the tissue and so less oxygen is reaching the tissue resulting in tissue death (ischemia).|$|R

Determination of MYF 4 genotypes was performed by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). For histochemical analysis, 5 animals detected as homozygotes of the MYF 4 -AA type and 5 animals of the heterozygous genotype AB were used out of the total 25 individual animals tested. The histochemical analysis demonstrated that homozygotes AA had larger fat cells on the average than heterozygotes AB in the three studied muscles, which was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). The percentage surface representation of <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> was higher in the studied muscles of heterozygotes MYF 4 -AB.

The size of the patches increases {{in the next three}} to six hours, with maximum lividity occurring between eight and twelve hours after death. The blood pools into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissues</b> of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which capillaries are compressed.|$|R
5000|$|During development, {{primordial}} {{germ cells}} migrate into the seminiferous tubules and downward towards the basement membrane whilst remaining {{attached to the}} sertoli cells where they will subsequently differentiate into SSCs, {{also referred to as}} Asingle spermatogonia. These SSCs can either self-renew or commit to differentiating into spermatozoa upon the proliferation of Asingle into Apaired spermatogonia. The 2 cells of Apaired spermatogonia remain attached by intercellular bridges and subsequently divide into Aaligned spermatogonia, which is made up of 4-16 connected cells. Aaligned spermatogonia then undergo meiosis I to form spermatocytes and meiosis II to form spermatids which will mature into spermatozoa. [...] This differentiation occurs along the longitudinal axis of sertoli cells, from the basement membrane to the apical lumen of the seminiferous tubules. However, sertoli cells form tight junctions that separate SSCs and spermatogonia in contact with the basement membrane from the spermatocytes and spermatids to create a basal and an adluminal compartment, whereby differentiating spermatocytes must traverse the tight junctions. These tight junctions form the blood testis barrier (BTB) and have been suggested {{to play a role in}} isolating differentiated cells in the adluminal compartment from secreted factors by the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> and vasculature neighboring the basal compartment.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the long-term treatment of rats with letrozole on the testis morphology. The pharmacologically induced estrogen deficiency caused statistically significant decreases of both intratesticular and serum levels of estradiol, and morphological changes in the seminiferous epithelium and in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> of the testes. Six months of treatment resulted in the sloughing of premature germ cells of the seminiferous epithelium into the tubular lumen and in intraepithelial vacuolization. Multinucleated giant cells composed of premature germ cells, conglomerates of various cell nuclei and cell debris as well as irregularities and infoldings of the tubular basement membrane were also seen. Moreover, deep invaginations of the lamina propria with myoid cells were observed. Cells in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tissue</b> showed changes similar to that observed in aging processes. The cytoplasm of LH-R-positive Leydig cells was loaded with lipofuscin granules.

The tunica albuginea of the testicular capsule was composed mainly of myoid cells. A zonal arrangement of desmin and SMA immunostaining was observed in myoid cells of the tunica albuginea in 1 - to 24 -day-old quails. Immunostaining for SMA and desmin was uniform in the tunica albuginea of adult birds. Vimentin immunostaining in the testicular capsule was demonstrated in mesothelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.

Groups of male Sprague–Dawley rats were intratracheally instilled with 0. 04, 0. 2, or 1 mg/kg of the individually dispersed MWCNT suspension. After instillation, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was assessed for inflammatory cells and markers, and the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and cerebrum were histopathologically evaluated at 3 -day, 1 -week, 1 -month, 3 -month, and 6 -month post-exposure. Transient pulmonary inflammatory responses were observed only in the lungs of the group of rats exposed to 1 mg/kg of MWCNTs.
