40|$|Increasingly traffic {{management}} measures exhibit dynamic features, {{taking into account}} dynamics in the traffic demand pattern or transport system supply pattern. Some examples are <b>demand</b> <b>actuated</b> traffic signal settings or variable message signs. In most cases these measures function as stand alone systems. This {{means that there is}} no or hardly any co-ordination between the various measures. This lack of co-ordination could make the application of dynamic {{traffic management}} measures less effective: e. g. the measures could serve opposite objectives or even generate a negative impact on traffic flows that are not in any way related to the problem. Consequently the uncoordinated application of dynamic traffic management measures can be very counter-productive. To avoid these setbacks {{it will be necessary to}} be able to control the traffic in two ways: in a detailed way by focusing on the problem(s) that need(s) to be solved (distributed control), and in a more generic way by controlling the overall traffic performance in the network (generic control) ...|$|E
30|$|The latter {{detectors}} {{have been}} located at 30  m {{in order to}} create a gap time parameter of 2  s. After some experimentation with the Chania urban network, it was found out that, due to low <b>demands,</b> <b>actuated</b> stages serving secondary movements were running most times at or close to their minimum green times. As a consequence, gap times higher than 2  s for the respective secondary movements were letting no room at all for actuation, and were thus indifferent for their own traffic conditions and the traffic conditions of the whole network, as well.|$|R
50|$|In passive {{addition}} semi-closed rebreathers, gas {{is usually}} added by a <b>demand</b> type valve <b>actuated</b> by the bellows counterlung when the bellows is empty. This {{is the same}} actuation condition as the automatic diluent valve of any rebreather, but the actual trigger mechanism is slightly different. A passive rebreather of this type does not need a separate ADV as the passive addition valve already serves this function.|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on the Hindu {{fears of}} {{religious}} {{rule in the}} Muslim autonomous states, Iqbal said: [...] Muslim <b>demand</b> is not <b>actuated</b> {{by the kind of}} motive he imputes to us; it is actuated by a genuine desire for free development which is practically impossible under the type of unitary government contemplated by the nationalist Hindu politicians with a view to secure permanent command dominance in the whole of India. Nor should the Hindus fear that the creation of autonomous Muslim states will mean the introduction of a kind of religious rule in such states. I have already indicated to you {{the meaning of the word}} religion, as applied to Islam. The truth is that Islam is not a Church ... I therefore demand the formation of a consolidated Muslim State in the best interests of India and Islam. For India, it means security and peace resulting from an internal balance of power; for Islam, an opportunity to rid itself of the stamp that Arabian Imperialism was forced to give it, to mobilize its law, its education, its culture, and to bring them into closer contact with its own original spirit and with the spirit of modern times.|$|R
