United {{goal was}} under a nearly-constant, {{withering}} assault almost the entire match, but Hamid made one spectacular save after another to keep the match scoreless until the 69th minute. That's when referee {] showed Hamid a straight red card, after the goalie had come out to defend a breakaway by Red Bulls' striker Kenny Cooper and either <b>did</b> <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> initiate contact with Cooper. An irate Hamid was replaced by back-up 'keeper Joe Willis, who would carve his name into the team's annals and the hearts of United fans forever. Cooper beat Willis on the spot kick, beat referee Geiger ordered a retake because of encroachment by two Red Bulls players. Willis confidently dove left and blocked Cooper's second attempt. United was forced to play short-handed for a short time, but a reckless tackle against Pontius by the Red Bulls' Rafa Marquez earned a second yellow card and ejection. Shortly before stoppage time, D.C. went ahead, as a deft pass by defender Robbie Russell found Nick DeLeon. who slipped the ball over the sliding New York goalkeeper for {{what seemed to be}} the series winning goal. However, the Red Bulls had an excellent opportunity to force extra-time as they lined up a free kick {{on the edge of the}} penalty area during stoppage time. Despite having one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, Thierry Henry, who was also one of the great set-piece takers, the Red Bulls players decided to let Miller take the kick, and he sent it over the net. United left New Jersey with a 2-1 aggregate score series victory.|$|E

The expressed view of some that this overwhelming majority was only due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections, however, is not accepted by all observers. Lefebvre was one of those who voted against the declaration, but he was one of those who added their signature to the document, after that of the Pope, though not all present did sign. Lefebvre later declared that the sheet of paper that he signed and that was [...] "passed from hand to hand among the Fathers of the Council and upon which everyone placed his signature, had no meaning of a vote for or against, but signified simply our presence at the meeting to vote for four documents." [...] However, the paper on which his signature appears, and which was not [...] "the relatively unimportant attendance sheet which Lefebvre recalled in his interview", bears [...] "the title Declaratio de Libertate Religiosa (along with the titles of three other documents) at the top," [...] and [...] "(t)he fathers were informed that if they wished to sign one or more documents, but not all of them, they could make a marginal annotation beside their name, specifying which documents they <b>did</b> <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> wish to sign.
