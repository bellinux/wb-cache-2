Design: Twenty-six patients (mean age, 28. 72 years; range, 11 - 56 years) underwent osteochondral autologous transplan-tation (OATS) for chondral defects with filling of the knee joint donor sites using Trufit BGS plugs. The mean follow-up interval between implantation and MRI analysis was 21. 3 months (range, 6 - 39 months). During this period, 43 cartilage-sensitive and 25 quantitative T 2 -mapping MRI studies were performed. The donor sites were assessed for plug and inter-face morphology, displacement, hypertrophy, subchondral edema, presence of bony overgrowth, percentage fill, and degree of incorporation. T 2 relaxation times were measured for the superficial and deep layers of the repair tissue. A linear regression and correlational analysis was performed with Bonferroni correction, and P < 0. 05 was defined as significant.

Nicotine inhalers that are marketed as nicotine replacement therapy {{should not be}} confused with electronic cigarettes, which produce vapour and which are marketed mainly as devices that smokers can use in non-smoking areas. Nicotine inhalers are also known by their nickname of “the puffer”. These devices are made of thin plastic, sometimes resembling a cigarette, or a cylinder shape. It contains a porous nicotine <b>filled</b> <b>plug,</b> located in the base of the product. When you puff on the inhaler, nicotine vapor is inhaled and absorbed in the mouth’s lining. Every inhaler delivers almost four hundred puffs of this nicotine vapor. It is also considered healthier than the traditional cigarette, as it takes about eighty puffs to get an equal amount of nicotine that is acquired through only one cigarette. The nicotine inhaler is also temperature sensitive. In cooler weather, less nicotine is delivered. The Nicotine Inhaler is considered easier to use than the electronic cigarette as it is usually disposable, and contains fewer parts than the electronic cigarette. The evidence suggests that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted products such as a nicotine inhaler may be a safer way to give nicotine than e-cigarettes.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of calcination and sulfation in the simultaneous calcination/sulfation of limestone sorbent under circulating fluidized bed boiler conditions was studied. A specially designed constant-temperature reactor which {{can stop the}} reaction {{at a given time}} was employed. When limestone entered the furnace of mixed gases of CO 2, O 2, SO 2, etc., its weight went down first, then up, so there was a minimum weight point. The whole reaction period could be divided into two stages by this minimum weight point, named the weight-loss stage and the weight-growth stage, which were dominated by the calcination reaction and by the sulfation reaction, respectively. In the weight-loss stage, the sulfation reaction took place and CaSO 4 formed simultaneously together with limestone calcination as long as SO 2 was present. In the weight-growth stage, the sulfation ratio at 60 min in simultaneous calcination/sulfation is 30. 7 % higher than that in the sequential calcination then sulfation process. The weight loss rate of limestone calcined in the presence of SO 2 was lower than that without SO 2 present but the final weight was higher. The calcination of limestone was slowed by the presence of SO 2; a probable mechanism was proposed, namely that the CaSO 4 formed may <b>fill</b> or <b>plug</b> the pores in the CaO layer, and impede the transfer of CO 2 and, therefore, retard the calcination reaction. This mechanism was supported by the observation that the effective diffusion coefficient of CO 2 in CaO produced in the presence of SO 2 was reduced. The impeding effect increased with increasing SO 2 concentration (0 – 3000 ppm), while, when the particle size decreased from 0. 4 – 0. 45 mm to 0. 2 – 0. 25 mm, the calcination rate of limestone was higher, no matter whether there was SO 2 present or not. The impeding effect was less pronounced at 880 °C than at 850 °C. The reason for this appears to be {{the fact that there was}} less CaSO 4 formed at 880 °C and, therefore, fewer pores of the particle were <b>filled</b> or <b>plugged...</b>|$|R

While the blocking of conventional slurry occurs due to deposition of heavy particles at low flow velocity or arching of large rigid particles, that of snow/water slurry is caused by a compressed plug of snow formed due to cohesive nature of snow particles.
