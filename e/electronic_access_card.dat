50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>access</b> card/Smart <b>card</b> - Smart card are credit card-sized plastic {{cards that}} house an {{embedded}} integrated circuit. They {{can be used}} in electronic commerce for providing personal security, stored value and mobility. At the functional level, smart cards can be categorised as either memory cards or microprocessor cards. Memory cards, such as disposable pre-paid payphone cards or loyalty card, are the most cheapest form of smart card. They contain a small amount of memory in the form of ROM (read only memory) and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory). Microprocessor cards are more advanced than simple memory cards in that they contain a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit) and RAM (random access memory) in addition to ROM and EEPROM. The ROM contains the card's operating system and factory-loaded applications.|$|R

This will be {{registered}} on the Internet and allows an <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder {{to gain access to}} the Project DIVA Arcade Diva.Net. Here, an <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder can edit data and perform many and more of the functions that a Project DIVA Arcade machine can do. However, an <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder must first accumulate 10 non-consecutive plays on any Project DIVA Arcade machine with an Internet connection before they can use many of Diva.Net's functions. Once 10 plays are accumulated, the <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder will gain 30-day access to all of Diva.Net's functions. Access to Diva.Net can only be performed this way, and one gains another 30 days of access every 10 plays. This [...] "access" [...] is known as a Diva.Net Right. Upon first play, a Card holder can automatically obtain a Diva.Net Right once. Losing one's Right does not affect the data, but the Card holder is unable to change it through Diva.Net until another Right is obtained.|$|R

40|$|On 7 February 2007, the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007 was {{introduced}} into the Federal Parliament by the Minister for Human Services. The purpose of the Bill was to introduce a Health and Social Services <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> (the 'Access Card') by 2008 using smart card technology. Registration for the card was to be required by all Australian citizens seeking entitlement to health and social service benefits. The introduction of the <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> would be within an Australian Government-controlled framework of interoperable smart cards. This structure may not necessarily have been accessed under the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007, {{but it is certainly}} available for current and future government smartcard use. The Bill, passed by the House of Representatives on 28 February, and then {{introduced into the}} Senate on the same day, was adjourned and later withdrawn that same day. The <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> and the Register (the database that supports the <b>Access</b> <b>Card)</b> both have the potential to permanently erode the established rights of Australian citizens to information privacy currently secured by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This paper analyses the detrimental impact of the <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> on privacy with respect to three concerns: the potential for function creep; that it is in all respects a quasi-identity card; and that it provides the opportunity for increased identity fraud and identity theft. ...|$|R
