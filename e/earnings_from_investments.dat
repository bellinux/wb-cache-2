Opportunism {{is more likely to be}} observed for firms for which it is inefficient to ex ante specify the method of accounting for associates. The ability to act opportunistically is defined as the degree of influence which an investor exercises over the financial and/or operating policies of its investees. The results are confirmatory. For firms which have a lower ex ante probability of managing earnings, use of the cost method significantly improves consolidated return on investment compared with returns calculated using the equity method. Firms which are more likely to choose the equity method for efficiency reasons have an insignificant difference between cost and equity returns...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{energy savings}} can be {{achieved}} in the {{pulp and paper industry}} through process integration. The aim of this paper was to investigate how much seasonal variations in the process influence the potential for making energy savings. The hot and warm water system in a market pulp mill has been evaluated from an energy point of view, using pinch analysis. Considerable energy-saving potential was found, 40. 7 MW, of which 16. 5 MW was in the form of steam savings. The steam savings represent 7 % of the total steam consumption at the mill. New heat exchanger networks were redesigned using different approaches. The influence of seasonal variations was estimated from the calculated energy savings when monthly averages were used in the new heat exchanger networks. When seasonal variations were taken into account, the energy-saving opportunities fell by 2. 5 – 5. 0 MW, depending on heat exchanger network design, compared with a steady-state scenario. Consequently, 88 – 94 % of the theoretical energy savings could be realised.

The empirical literature on this issue is inconclusive to date, hence this paper uses a quasi-field experiment to examine this question.

Participants' control over family income was varied through how they shared <b>earnings</b> <b>from</b> their <b>investment</b> decisions with their spouse, and also through the form of payment.

However, the nature of information their spouse received ex-post had little impact. Strikingly, even {{when there was no}} tradeoff between maximizing household and private income, {{about a third of the}} men in the sample undercut their own private income so as to narrow the income gap with their wives.

Simulations show that for a range of inequality aversion parameters, the welfare gains from current redistribution for the Mexican PROGRESA conditional cash transfer program are as large, or possibly much larger, than the estimated present discounted value of future <b>earnings</b> <b>from</b> human capital <b>investments</b> in lower and upper secondary schooling.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Annual Inquiry into Foreign Direct Investment (AFDI) collects financial data concerning Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The survey is conducted in two parts: the inward FDI relates to foreign investment into the UK from foreign parent or subsidiary companies, while the outward FDI relates to investment by UK-based companies to their overseas parents or subsidiary companies. In particular, the AFDI surveys UK companies about their relationship with oversees affiliates in terms of flows of <b>investment,</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>from</b> <b>investment</b> and international investment positions. Companies are restricted to those where the foreign investment amounts to at least 10 percent of the ordinary shares or voting power. Two files are available for each year: for inward and outward FDI, respectively. Data on earnings for subsidiaries and branches are available, as well as transactions between UK companies and their foreign subsidiaries or parent companies, including transfers of capital. These data are useful to researchers who wish to analyse the relationship between UK companies and overseas-based parent companies or subsidiaries. The data are also useful for broader research into firm-level activity and foreign direct investment. Surveys are sent to enterprise group 'heads' (i. e. the headquarters of a company, which in turn may own a number of smaller companies) based in the UK. The register from which the firms are sampled comes from sources including HM Customs and Revenue, Dunn and Bradstreet's 'Worldbase' system, and ONS inquiries on Acquisitions and Mergers. Sampling is stratified {{and based on the}} value of the net investment position of the foreign affiliates (outward FDI) or the UK group (inward FDI). The sample is heavily weighted towards larger enterprise groups, which account {{for the vast majority of}} FDI assets. The largest firms all receive the survey forms, while only a proportion of the smaller firms receive the forms. The sample is rotated each year for the smaller firms. Data are collected on both the UK company and its foreign affiliate(s), which may be the overseas-based parent company or an overseas-based subsidiary. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the third edition (January 2016), all data and documentation has been updated. This includes the addition of 2012 and 2013 data files and documentation. Main Topics : For each company in the survey, information is collected on their foreign affiliate(s) with regard to: country and industry of operation percentage of equity held (either by the UK company in its foreign subsidiary, or by the foreign parent company in its UK company) operating profits (of the UK company and its affiliate) transactions and flows of equity capital (e. g. payments made to the UK by its foreign parent company, or by the UK to its foreign subsidiary) acquisitions and disposals of equity capital (by the foreign parent to its UK subsidiary, or by the UK company to its foreign subsidiary) levels of investment (by the foreign parent to its UK subsidiary, or by the UK company to its foreign subsidiary), including: reinvestment of earnings; capital reserves; loans; current account balances </ul...|$|R
