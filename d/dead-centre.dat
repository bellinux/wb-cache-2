The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top <b>dead-centre</b> (TDC) to bottom <b>dead-centre</b> (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E

60|$|Our drive {{till then}} {{had been quite}} a success. The other men in the car were my friend Woodhouse, young Ollyett, a distant {{connection}} of his, and Pallant, the M.P. Woodhouse's business was the treatment and cure of sick journals. He knew by instinct the precise moment in a newspaper's life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it fetches up on the <b>dead-centre</b> between slow and expensive collapse and the new start which can be given by gold injections--and genius. He was wisely ignorant of journalism; but when he stooped on a carcase there was sure to be meat. He had that week added a half-dead, halfpenny evening paper to his collection, which consisted of a prosperous London daily, one provincial ditto, and a limp-bodied weekly of commercial leanings. He had also, that very hour, planted me with a large block of the evening paper's common shares, and was explaining the whole art of editorship to Ollyett, a young man three years from Oxford, with coir-matting-coloured hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh experiences, who, I understood, was assisting in the new venture. Pallant, the long, wrinkled M.P., whose voice {{is more like a}} crane's than a peacock's, took no shares, but gave us all advice.|$|E

Otis Yeere {{was one of those}} {{wandering}} 'dumb' characters, foredoomed through life to be nobody's property. Ten years in Her Majesty's Bengal Civil Service, spent, for the most part, in undesirable Districts, had given him little to be proud of, and nothing to bring confidence. Old enough to have lost the first fine careless rapture that showers on the immature 'Stunt imaginary Commissionerships and Stars, and sends him into the collar with coltish earnestness and abandon; too young to be yet able to look back upon the progress he had made, and thank Providence that under the conditions of the day he had come even so far, he stood upon the <b>dead-centre</b> of his career. And when a man stands still he feels the slightest impulse from without. Fortune had ruled that Otis Yeere should be, for the first part of his service, one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels of the Administration; losing heart and soul, and mind and strength, in the process. Until steam replaces manual power in the working of the Empire, there must always be this percentage must always be the men who are used up, expended, in the mere mechanical routine. For these promotion is far off and the mill-grind of every day very instant. The Secretariats know them only by name; they are not the picked men of the Districts with Divisions and Collectorates awaiting them. They are simply the rank and file the food for fever sharing with the ryot and the plough-bullock the honour of being the plinth on which the State rests. The older ones have lost their aspirations; the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh. Both learn to endure patiently {{until the end of the}} day. Twelve years in the rank and file, men say, will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the wits of the most keen.|$|E

This method uses the input–output polynomial equation of the linkage and the corresponding Sturm functions to formulate the necessary condition of the <b>dead-centre</b> configurations as a polynomial equation {{in terms of the}} input parameter only. A simple analytical method for identifying the true <b>dead-centre</b> positions among the real solutions to the condition equation is also developed. The proposed method is conceptually straightfor-ward and does not rely on any structure-related geometric conditions; therefore, it can be systematically applied to all types of Stephenson linkages and other multiple-loop, single degree-of-freedom linkages regardless of the selections of the input–output pair and the type of the joints...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A general {{approach}} for branch identification and motion domain analysis of Stephenson type six-bar linkages is presented. By applying the Sturm theorem to the input– output polynomial equation, the <b>dead-centre</b> {{positions of the}} linkage are first evaluated and classified into two groups in order to discriminate {{the upper and lower}} bounds of the motion domains. The circuits of the linkage are then identified by matching the dead centres to the branches, which are attributed in accordance with the case where the input is assigned to a joint within the four-bar chain. Finally, the branches and motion domains of the more complicated case where the input is given through one of the uncoupled joints within the five-bar chain, are identified by mapping the circuits onto the domain of the specified input joint. This approach does not rely on the coupler curve of the constituent four-linkmechanism. This is also suitable for computer implementation and can be systematically applied to all types of Stephenson linkages, regardless of the types of joints and the selection of input–output pair...|$|E
