Three questions guided this study: (1) How do the “natural” or taken for granted social roles and positionings of teachers and researchers interact, enable, and constrain our work together? (2) How can the development of portfolios be impacted by contextual factors? And (3) based on findings from the first two questions, what can be claimed about the possibilities and constraints that face teachers and researchers engaged in collaborative action research? The teacher and I experienced numerous challenges as well as conflict as we tried to engage in collaborative action research. This conflict tended to center on the amount of available resources, differing knowledge bases and perceptions of the value of <b>knowledge,</b> the <b>intersection</b> of our professional discourses, and the interpersonal relationships we developed. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{combining}} {{data from}} distinct sources, {{there is a}} need to share meta-data and other knowledge about various source domains. Due to semantic inconsistencies and heterogeneity of representations, problems arise in combining multiple domains when the domains are merged. The knowledge that is irrelevant to the task of interoperation will be included, making the result unnecessarily complex. This heterogeneity problem can be eliminated by mediating the conflicts and managing the intersections of the domains. For interoperation and intelligent access to heterogeneous information, the focus is on the <b>intersection</b> of the <b>knowledge,</b> since <b>intersection</b> will define the required articulation rules. An algebra over domain has been proposed to use articulation rules to support disciplined manipulation of domain knowledge resources. The objective of a domain algebra is to provide the capability for interrogating many domain knowledge resources, which are largely semantically disjoint. The algebra supports formally the tasks of selecting, combining, extending, specializing, and modifying Components from a diverse set of domains. This paper presents a domain algebra and demonstrates the use of articulation rules to link declarative interfaces for Internet and enterprise applications. In particular, it discusses the articulation implementation as part of a production system capable of operating over the domain described by the IDL (interface description language) of objects registered in multiple CORBA servers...|$|R

Contingency in existence provides a context for a proposal to conceive of special divine action as determining quantum states that, physically speaking, seem to be indeterminate. Such a proposal, as defended by Robert J.

The contingency of existence is independent of science, and might be appreciated if one assumes a different view of God, not as an actor in nature but as the Author of nature...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge Management (KM) in the 1990 s {{was a key}} upwardly-mobile {{management}} discipline. Indeed, {{a proliferation}} of articles suggested KM {{had the potential to}} make a radical departure from conventional views of organisational assets and resources, and even held the promise of transforming economies. Instead, however, KM has tended to become incorporated as a subset of traditional management. This thesis suggests that, as a result, knowledge has been perceived simply as another resource to be managed for competitive advantage. It further argues that KM need not subscribe to conventional views of management and that knowledge need not be just another resource to be exploited, hoarded, and traded. Instead, it contends that knowledge is an outcome of the process of connecting to one another in new ways and explores the field’s still-unrealised potential for generating fresh approaches relevant to contemporary conditions. In seeking to revive the excitement, and rekindle the potential, that originally surrounded the field, the thesis intervenes in current debates in KM. It attends to, and expands, the existing discourses of KM while presenting the case for a re-energised understanding of the communication of <b>knowledge.</b> Exploring <b>intersections</b> with other disciplines as well as KM’s own multidisciplinary base, it proposes transdisciplinary research as a productive focus for KM. In making these recommendations for KM’s future, the thesis seeks to make the field more responsive to current complex and dynamic academic, organisational, and social contexts. Its overall goal is not only to ensure KM’s ongoing relevance and effectiveness as a field, but to direct KM towards fulfilling its early potential...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Government has {{funded the}} Teaching Teachers for the Future (TTF) project to {{increase}} preservice teachers' capacity to embed ICT {{in their teaching}} practice (Education Services Australia, 2011). The planning model promoted by the TTF project details three overlapping knowledge domains: technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and content <b>knowledge.</b> The <b>intersection</b> of these domains {{is referred to as}} technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). TPACK is promoted as a model for teachers to use when they plan mathematics and science curriculum for Indigenous students. This paper argues that when planning with the TPACK model the teacher also needs to explicitly acknowledge the attributes and resources of the Indigenous students. This feature of teaching design and implementation needs to be further developed in pre-service education and teacher professional development. It is imperative for educators to acknowledge and value the attributes and cultural dimensions Indigenous students bring to the classroom: their lived languages, experiences and knowledge for the purpose of their learning. Here, the term 'culture' is used to refer to an individual's habit of mind; the development of a whole society; or the whole way of life of a group of people (Rojek, 2007). The paper positions Indigenous students as agentic in both negotiating their mathematical and scientific learning dispositions and using technological models and simulations. A key purpose of the paper is to highlight the socially negotiated and embedded nature of meaning-making, how one's culture influences how an individual or a group can make primary sense of their world and thus proposes a more holistic approach to TPACK for Indigenous students in mathematics and science classrooms...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{well-documented}} intensive {{battle between}} Alfred Kinsey and American psychiatrists around the mid-twentieth century, this paper argues that Kinsey's work, in fact, {{played a significant}} role in transforming mental health experts' view of homosexuality starting as far back as the late 1940 s and extending all the way through the mid- 1960 s. After analyzing the way in which Kinsey's work pushed American psychiatrists to re-evaluate their understanding of homosexuality indirectly through the effort of clinical psychologists, I then focus to a greater extent on examples that illustrate how the Kinsey reports directly influenced members of the psychiatric community. In the conclusion, using a Foucauldian conception of “discourse,” I propose that in order to approach the struggle around the pathological status of homosexuality in the 1950 s and the 1960 s, thinking in terms of a “politics of knowledge” is more promising than simply in terms of a “politics of diagnosis. ” Central to the struggle was not merely the matter of medical diagnosis, but larger issues regarding the production of <b>knowledge</b> at an <b>intersection</b> of science and medicine where the parameters of psychopathology were disputed in the context of mid-twentieth-century United States...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} short films with women in Australian Aboriginal (YolNu) communities in northeast Arnhem Land, questions arose about how the content and {{the process of}} production were defined and adjusted to suit both parties. This research examines how filmmakers take roles as health educators and how YolNu women as the “actors” define and direct the film. It explores ways that the filmmakers tried to ensure that YolNu identity was maintained in a biomedical agenda through the use of storytelling in language. An important dialogue develops regarding ownership and negotiation of health information and <b>knowledge,</b> addressing this <b>intersection</b> in a way that truly characterizes the spirit of community-based participatory research. Although the filmmaking processes were initially analyzed in the context of feminist and educational empowerment theories, we conclude that Latour’s (2005) theory of actor networks leads to a more coherent way to explore participatory filmmaking as a health education tool. The analysis in this work provides a framework to integrate health communication, Indigenous women’s issues, and filmmaking practices. In contrasting participatory filmmaking with health promotion and ethnographic film, the importance of negotiating the agenda is revealed.

40|$|At {{the height}} of the {{imperial}} age, European powers ruled over most parts of the Islamic world. The British, French, Russian, and Dutch empires each governed more Muslims than any independent Muslim state. European officials believed Islam to be of great political significance, and were quite cautious when it came to matters of the religious life of their Muslim subjects. In the colonies, they regularly employed Islamic religious leaders and institutions to bolster imperial rule. At the same time, the European presence in Muslim lands was confronted by religious resistance movements and Islamic insurgency. Across the globe, from the West African savanna to the shores of Southeast Asia, Muslim rebels called for holy war against non-Muslim intruders. Islam and the European Empires presents the first comparative account of the engagement of all major European empires with Islam.

40|$|As {{scholars}} have registered, many female-authored travel {{accounts of the}} eighteenth and nineteenth centuries need to be recognized simultaneously as exercises in historical commentary and debate. This article extends our <b>knowledge</b> of this <b>intersection</b> of genres through analysis of two striking examples of women's travel writing operating as a mode of historiography: Maria Graham's Journal of a Voyage to Brazil (1824) and Journal of a Residence in Chile (1824). In the often overlooked prefatory material used to frame the central journal sections of these books, Graham undertook a more ambitious and original historiographical exercise than is generally appreciated. The journal portions also spoke to contemporary historical enquiries in ways not always recognized by modern critics—for example, in their occasional use of sentimental idioms and motifs. Although in these and other passages, Graham's writing may seem today more “literary” than historiographical, this was not how they were received by many contemporary readers, who accepted Graham's account as a useful contribution to the history of South America. This reception demonstrates the importance of not reading nineteenth-century travel writing solely as “life writing”, but rather as a multidisciplinary and generically hybrid form which women might use to assert and display authority across a range of discourses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ray tracing {{a volume}} scene graph {{composed}} of multiple point-based volume objects (PBVO) can produce high quality images with effects such as shadows and constructive operations. A naive approach, however, would demand an overwhelming amount of memory to accommodate all point datasets and their associated control {{structures such as}} octrees. This paper describes an out-of-core system for rendering such a scene graph in a scalable manner. In order to address the difficulty in pre-determining the order of data caching, we introduce a technique based on a dynamic, in-core working set. We present a ray-driven algorithm for predicting the working set automatically. This allows both the data and the control structures required for ray tracing to be dynamically pre-fetched according to access patterns determined based on captured <b>knowledge</b> of ray-data <b>intersection.</b> We have {{conducted a series of}} experiments on the scalability of the technique using working sets and datasets of different sizes. With the aid of both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that this approach allows the rendering of multiple large PBVOs in a volume scene graph be performed on desktop computers.

40|$|Disciplines codify related {{knowledge}} and have developed powerful approaches that enable both solutions {{to a wide}} variety of problems and efficient further extension of knowledge. Individual disciplines have translated into individual departments within universities. Academic departments tend to turn inward, deepening the knowledge within the discipline. Because of this inwardness, the differing methodological approaches among disciplines, and the reward systems within disciplines and universities, it is difficult for faculty to reach outside their disciplines and departments, so as to share {{knowledge and}}/or mine <b>knowledge</b> at the <b>intersections</b> of disciplines. However, world needs and opportunities are increasingly complex and require integrated, in-depth contributions from multiple disciplines for progress. Means for universities to encourage and facilitate multidisciplinary activities include organizational structure, incentive budgeting, and leadership and resources that enable directors of multidisciplinary units to negotiate effectively with academic department chairs. Major competitive initiatives involving large resources have proven particularly effective. New universities have opportunities for multidisciplinary research and teaching that would be much more difficult within existing universities. Today’s university graduates must be able to work effectively with persons from other disciplines and understand enough of the basic vocabulary and methodologies of other disciplines to enable that collaboration. A liberal undergraduate education addresses those needs, where the definition of “liberal” encompasses courses reflecting many different disciplines, including the natural sciences and even some engineering.

40|$|This paper’s {{objective}} is to articulate possible lessons for conceptualising and interrogating academic mobility to be learned by drawing on contemporary thinking about two key social and educational issues: the knowledge economy and sustainability. In turn, the paper also explores how current understandings of academic mobility can contribute to challenging and extending the comprehension of those issues. The theoretical framework is composed of the concepts of situated learning, systems thinking, risk and capacity building, clustered around {{the ways in which}} various groups of occupational Travellers conform to and depart from the notion of mobile learning communities (Danaher, Moriarty, & Danaher, 2009). The paper’s principal finding is twofold. Firstly, concepts associated with the knowledge economy and sustainability are helpful in extending our current understandings of the manifestations and effects of academic mobility in different contexts. In particular, those manifestations and effects demonstrate the impact of changing notions of <b>knowledge</b> and its <b>intersection</b> with economic and social life, as well as enhanced comprehension of the benefits and costs of academic mobility when evaluated against a fluid and situated view of sustainability. Secondly, constructing academic mobility through the lens of mobile learning communities adds to the depth and richness of contemporary conceptualisations of the knowledge economy and sustainability, thereby highlighting the ongoing significance of academic mobility as a growing field of scholarship. Seen from this perspective, mobile learning communities can indeed teach us valuable lessons for and from academic mobility, the knowledge economy and sustainability. ...|$|R
40|$|The Bentley Ottmann sweep line {{algorithm}} {{is a standard}} tool to compute the arrangement of algebraic curves in the plane. If degenerate positions are not excluded from the input, variants of this algorithm must, among other things, handle k ≥ 2 curves intersecting simultaneously in a single intersection point. In that situation, the algorithm knows {{the order of the}} curves immediately left of the intersection point and needs to compute the order immediately right of the intersection point. Segments and lines can be reordered efficiently in linear time by simply reversing their order, except for overlapping segments. Algebraic curves can be sorted with O(k logk) geometric comparisons in their order immediately right of the intersection point. A previous result shows that algebraic curves whose degree is at most d can be reordered in O(d 2 k) time, which is for constant d better than sorting. In this paper, we improve the complexity of the reordering of algebraic curves to O(k) time, i. e., independent of the degree of the algebraic curves. The maybe surprising implication is that algebraic curves, even of unbounded algebraic degree, cannot realize all possible permutations of their vertical order while passing through a common intersection from left to right. We give a short example for an infeasible permutation. Both linear time algorithms require the <b>knowledge</b> of the <b>intersection</b> multiplicities of curves that are neighbors immediately left of the intersection point, i. e., k − 1 intersection multiplicities. ...|$|R

The data from interviews with 32 participants were combined to give a total sample of 303. The survey questionnaire and the interview schema contained both open-ended and structured questions with predetermined alternatives. The thesis revealed significant diversity in the attitudes of academics toward the commercialisation of research. Three types of academics were identified in this study: traditionalists, pragmatists and entrepreneurs. These three types of academics represent different kind of actors in the academic community who have different concepts of science and, in particular, the role of science in industrial innovation. The findings in the thesis suggest not only that the academic community may be ignorant of opportunities in the commercialisation of research and its underlying rationale, but that academics may have quite divergent views on the appropriateness of taking part in the exploitation of research. One of the main findings, however, was that European Union framework programmes {{play an important role in}} enhancing entrepreneurial activities, such as the social and technical competency to patent and exploit academic research, among academics. However, many academics still lack the necessary skills for entrepreneurial activities, and by the same token, inefficient institutional settings and confusing regulations and rules are significant obstacles to successful academic entrepreneurship.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{teaching}} method is proposed {{to design the}} contents of the interdisciplinary courses for the specialized mechanical engineering education. The paper discusses the necessity of assigning the proper interdisciplinary courses on the analysis of currently increasing mixed-talent requirement in our modern society. The characteristics of interdisciplinary research are elucidated in order to obtain the hints for guiding the reform of {{teaching method}} to suit for the new status that occur in the interdisciplinary course. The relationships and intersections among the different majors are regards as the most important factor for teaching the interdisciplinary courses well. Refining the associated <b>knowledge</b> from these <b>intersections</b> is the core task for teachers since these contents are very easy to avoid the intense inner anxiety and conflict for the student due to the difference between the own and other majors. For the teacher, the contents of lessons should be designed on the basic of the specialized skill of student’s major and not exceed their knowledge structures on a large degree. Based on this behavior, the detailed knowledge of specialized mechanical engineering is gradually assigned in the classes and terminally the whole specialized industry is learned by the student, which is the desired goal. Finally, the example of electrical machinery is addressed for verifying the effectiveness of the approach of refining the intersections to design the contents and classes. The practical results show that the method proposed in this paper has the high effectiveness on teaching the interdisciplinary specialized mechanical engineering education. In addition, we believe that this schema is also able to be applied for the related interdisciplinary courses...|$|R
